            "selftext": "I don't know if it is just me, or just related to the area where I live it - but there is such a daycare shortage here that I am uncomfortable communicating certain things to my daycare provider. All the daycare handbooks I have read allow them to stop accepting my child, for any reason, with 1 week notice.  However, it would take much longer than 1 week to find a new daycare. For both of my kids it took months to find a new daycare when they were first born, and again later when they were older and we moved. At my very first daycare they changed the policy so that payments happened through automatic withdrawls from my bank account initiated by them. We expressed that we weren't comfortable with that - and they told us that we had a week to conform or our children were not welcome there.  Perhaps that experience has me too on edge, but here are the things I am too afraid to tell them:\n\n* Please stop making drop off procedures so complicated.  It is hard enough to get children under the age of 5 to get out of the house in the morning.  Asking the parent to then help their kid take off outdoor shoes and put on indoor shoes, put on sunscreen, put away their lunch, get out their waterbottle, use the bathroom, wash their hands, sign in on a piece of paper, and move a rock with their name on it - then rinse and repeat for second child. While at the same time time I am supposed to sign in on two different electronic systems (four total across both rooms), check the cubbies for supplies, check the diaper table for other supplies, check the lunch area(s) for supplies, take off my own shoes, and wash my hands. This means that drop off can take anywhere from 10 min to 45 min depending on the mood of my children.\n* Ensure that your documentation is consistent - often handbooks, quick parent guides, email communication etc have different info on how many sets of clothes, whether or not to provide a water bottle, etc.\n* Don't tell my children you love them. Tell them they are awesome, tell them that they make your day, tell them you enjoy playing with them - but don't say you love them.  That isn't fair to children who need help understanding the difference between professional who will care for them during the day for a period of time and family/fictive kin who will be there for them for the rest of their lives.  If you \"love them\" but leave them when you find a new job at a new daycare - how do they know at 3 that they can trust other people in their lives who love them to stick around?\n*Stop asking me for donations. I understand the struggle of daycares, but the struggle of working parents is real too. I pay more for daycare than I would for in-state tuition. I pay more on daycare for one child than I do for two car payments.  Don't ask me to donate on top of it. Include your full needs in your rate so I can understand the expense at the beginning of the year and decide accordingly.",

I was getting worried about when I'd be able to convince her to eat them again, and how to keep her healthy until then. But...it hit me yesterday. She loves smoothies. I had so many recipes saved on pinterest of smoothies that had veggies in them too. So I tried it this morning, a berry kale smoothie. She loves it! The sun came out today and I feel hopeful again! Of course it's not an original thought, and I'll still continue to encourage her to eat them in non-deceptive ways. But for now, this is a win. Any moms have recipes of smoothies or secret veggie foods for themselves or their kids that would be good to try?",

            "selftext": "Hope this post is okay, but I\u2019m going crazy over here and need to vent so badly. \nMy MIL has always rubbed me the wrong way. She has an abrupt manner that just doesn\u2019t sit well with me but before I had my daughter it was tolerable. My daughter is now 4.5 months old and I cannot stand her now. \n\nI do have my reasons although I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m being too hard on her. To start, she makes unwanted comments about my daughters appearance or style. She remarked that she\u2019s \u2018too young\u2019 for a double chin (I had a double chin even when I\u2019m underweight so there\u2019s a chance my daughter may always have one). My daughter is also in the 50-85th percentile for weight so perfectly average. \nI put small bows on my little girl as she has a lot of hair that I can\u2019t tie yet so I use them to style it. She always remarks about how she might not want ribbons and she might be a tomboy. She only buys her boyish clothes and clothes that match what she wears which I find weird. \n\nMost recently she\u2019s begun taking my daughter from me without asking. She\u2019ll come up and say my turn and then take her from my arms. Last time I saw her she took the pram and walked ahead so quickly off that I could no longer see her. \n\nMy husband is getting frustrated that I don\u2019t like her but I just can\u2019t help it. I feel like she\u2019s undermining me as my baby\u2019s mum and being generally intrusive. It\u2019s gotten to the point where I dread going to see my in laws. \n\nDoes anybody else get this? I have no idea how to stop feeling this way.",

            "selftext": "I never want to make general statements for anyone else\u2019s experience. My toddler will be two in a few months and I just had baby number two and so far, I couldn\u2019t be happier. (It\u2019s only day 1 at home.) This is for anyone who has been thinking about having a second one. \n\nBaby number 1 was a long labor through the night with an epidural and pitocin. After two hours of pushing and using forceps, I had a third degree tear. Recovery was terrible for at least 3 weeks. Plus I had no idea what to do with a newborn. The first few months were tough due to recovery, learning and nursing. (Nobody told me nursing could be so challenging!)\n\nCut to baby number 2. She stayed in 2 weeks longer. I woke at 6:30am to my water being gently broken. Checked into the hospital at 8:05am and delivered at 9:40am. Things progressed so quickly that I had to STOP pushing until my doctor could make it back. Even though that last hour was miserable, since I had no meds in my system, I felt euphoric as soon as she came out. I only had a 1st degree tear. I was up and showered within the first 2/3 hours. I always already talking to her, nursing her, and ready for the rest of the day. \n\nI just instantly fell in love with baby 2 because I finally knew what to do with a baby. My first is my best buddy. But now I don\u2019t have to worry about how to hold baby, how to nurse baby, and I don\u2019t have to stress about everything she does. I just get to skip straight to loving her. I\u2019m kind of glad to have the \u201cdistraction\u201d of my first to tell myself, \u201cIt\u2019s ok to set her down and rest your brain while you play with baby 1.\u201d \n\n*Knowing baby 1 still has needs helps me to feel needed as a mom, more than just a survivor of a newborn. \n\nThank you for reading.",

She rolls over, sits unassisted for as long as she wants, can sit herself up from lying down, pulls to standing, waves, claps, and is working on crawling. But she doesn't babble. No baba, no gaga, no dada, no mama. She knows her name, knows the dog's name, and clearly understands words like milk, bath, eat, and a few others so she's definitely all there.\n\nA friend with a daughter one month younger than mine has posted videos of her baby saying \"dada\" and \"mama.\" It breaks my heart. Is something wrong with my kiddo?\n\nShe says \"hey\" (we're still not sure if she's actually saying a word or just making baby noises) and will occasionally say things that sound like made up words like \"hestaguh\" or \"hecked\" or \"loosecheck.\" But no Ms, B's, Ds, Ps, etc. Obviously I'll bring this up at her next doctor's appointment but it's not for another month and I get so upset every time I see a video of my friend's younger baby saying actual words. \n\nHow can I best help my kiddo?",

            "selftext": "I find it hard to get to know other mom's because we are all so busy hiding our authentic selves in order to come off as this \"good influence\" that society now expects us to be. We don't swear, we don't admit our true feelings, and we don't show our cards for fear of being judged by the \"bad\" mom police. It's isolating and makes it really hard to connect. \n\nMost of my friends are people who I've known since we were in our 20's. To the outside world, they seem just like all of the other mom's I meet: cookie cutter and predictable. But since I know them in a deeper level I see this whole other side to them, and they know me as a full authentic person, that's more than just a mom. I really doubt that if we met today we would have this deep of a friendship. \n\nMaybe it's because we hold so much in to try to keep a strong front for our kids, I dunno. But sometimes I wonder, of all these mom's in my kids class who seem relatively alike, which one I would actually enjoy hanging out with if we were able to be more honest about who we are. Anyone relate to this?",

            "selftext": "I\u2019m not looking for advice because i feel like I\u2019ve tried everything under the sun to stop my baby from hating his car seat and car rides. Usually car rides go smoothly when someone is sitting in the back with him and I obviously try to only get in the car when it\u2019s his nap time. He\u2019s usually good about falling asleep in his car seat but life doesn\u2019t revolve around my baby\u2019s sleep schedule sadly.. Today we were stuck in traffic on the way home for an hour and 20 min into the ride he vomited from crying so hard. I stopped cleaned him and played some videos for him but after that he yelled at the top of his lungs the rest of the ride. This has happened before but instead of turning into a complete anxiety riddled momma after I realized nothing was going to make him calm down I rolled down the windows and turned up my music nice and loud and took a deep breath. I just focused on the music and driving relatively calmly the rest of the ride. I\u2019m now home and after a bit of wine and a warm shower with my baby we are safe at home. \n\nI guess I wanted to vent but more importantly, nobody told me it was OKAY to ignore your baby, but it is. Especially when you are in a situation where you need to remain calm and focused and as long as baby is safe it\u2019s okay. I hope this helps someone because I wish someone had told me 10 months earlier",

I look at the little cresses on my babies neck or the way the bottom lip pokes out. He\u2019s the most beautiful thing I\u2019ve ever laid my eyes on and I want to do everything possible to make his life amazing. I\u2019ve done some shitty stuff in the past and he makes me just want to disappear and start all over. I want to be better for him. He deserves goodness in his life and I need to be good to make this happen. I don\u2019t want friends anymore, I just want to focus on my child and my family. As cheesy as it sounds, he really is my greatest most unexpected blessing.",

So far, our routine is us hanging out on the couch and me holding him a lot to soak up all the newborn snuggles. He sleeps a lot and when he\u2019s awake he mainly wants to eat. He usually has a longer amount of time he\u2019s awake in the morning to the afternoon and, like I said, I\u2019m usually holding him and nursing him depending on the cues he gives me. Sometimes I\u2019ll put him in his swing to get a few things done around the house and he\u2019ll get fussy about ten to fifteen minutes in so I\u2019ll pick him up and cuddle and nurse him. He gets tummy time and can hold his head up and turn it over really well. \n\nI\u2019ve read that you\u2019re supposed to talk to them and make funny faces and read to them and stuff and I do talk to him and love on him, but I don\u2019t really read or play with him because I honestly didn\u2019t really think about doing those things when he\u2019s this small. I don\u2019t really know how to play with him because he\u2019s not really focusing on anything while he\u2019s awake. He just looks around, even when I talk to him. Am I stunting his development by not stimulating, talking, and playing with him more? I feel like s shitty mom for not realizing and doing more things with him from the start.",

He looked forward to bedtime and needed me specifically. And now that it's finally gone for good (not having more kids) and Dad can help with bedtime routine, I'm sad for it's loss probably even more than I am proud for our accomplishment. I'm in no way complaining or ungrateful that I finally have some help and freedom, but I miss it despite the fact we still snuggle extra hard and still have special moments. It's just the nursing itself I'm mourning right now.

We had one and realized that even with our pretty decent career trajectories, we wouldn't have the time, money, or energy for more than one kid.\n\n\nA few months after I gave birth my husband got a vasectomy. Last week (so a few years later), I had a tubal ligation done.  I believe everyone should be responsible for their own birth control and not rely on their partner, regardless of how safe the birth control method may be.\n\n**I don't tell people this**. I just wanted to explain here where I'm coming from.\n\n\nAnyway, I told my mom about the surgery and a few friends. My mom implied it was something I should keep to myself, and my friends responses were a little weird. They just shared long winded platitudes about motherhood being so tough but rewarding.\n\n\nMy husband's co-workers all know because he had to fill something out for sick time, mentioned my surgery, so they all found out. I know that's not how that's supposed to work, but I don't care. They're a close knit group and good people. Some seemed sympathetic, saying they should probably get a vasectomy, but seemed confused as to why I'd have that procedure.\n\n\nSo, what would you think if a couple with one child both got sterilized? Is it really that weird?",

            "selftext": "I feel like I can't have a normal conversation anymore. Like, everyone has an opinion, and an experience that they must relay to someone else as being the worst, possible scenario. \n\nI'll set the scene....\n\nMy 6yo son is with his Montessori group at the local pool. I get a voicemail that says my son \"...pushed another child's head underwater and is no longer allowed to swim for the remainder of the day. The child that had his head pushed underwater is now very afraid to go back into the water.\" Obviously, I go to the pool to pick him up and he is sitting on his towel amongst all of the other children and am met by a young girl (one of his normal counselors) and the owner. \n\nI know I looked disappointed, because I was. His counselor asked me if I got her voicemail, I said I did. The owner then walked up and asked if her counselor had explained to me what happened. I said she had. I then began asking specifics about what happened, starting with if my son dunked the little boy's head or if my son held his head underwater. The owner then gave me a pretty decent brow-beating and began to recount the time she had her head held underwater and how that still terrifies her, and began to explain how she told the little boy that story. She explained to the little boy how that had happened to her and she's scarred for life because of it. \n\nIn my head, I was thinking: \"I don't care you had your head held underwater when you were little. I don't care. I truly don't. I could NOT care less.\" \n\nShe hadn't answered my question, so instead of repeating myself, which can come off rude, I attempt to rephrase my question - so I asked: \"Do we know if they were fighting or arguing? Was my son mad or had they been playing?\" My intentions were to understand the situation, understand where my son may have been coming from. It wasn't to shift blame, or to minimize what had happened. \n\nThe owner start stammering and stuttering, I could tell she was shocked I had asked that. She said it didnt matter, he could have seriously hurt him. She then proceeded to walk away, then repeat what I had asked her to another counselor and shake her head like I was a complete idiot. This was done about ten feet away. \n\nMy son and I left, and I asked him what happened. He said he had dunked his friend underwater and his friend said nothing. When they got out for break, his friend tattled on him, then his counselor came over and told him to sit next to the owner. He added he and his friend and the counselor were walking to the restroom at break and his friend told the counselor it was an accident, and my son corrected him and said it was on purpose.\n\nAfter he told me this, I took him to get an ice cream cone. When we are in our pool, we dunk each other. I told him this was an important lesson about keeping your hands to yourself. I dont think he meant any malice, or intended any harm, but I also know what he did was wrong.\n\nI'll tell you why I'm annoyed.\n\nI'm annoyed that the owner had to recount her horrific childhood incident to everyone, making the incident about her, therefore intensifying her feelings of irritation towards my son. I'm annoyed that no one could answer any of my questions about what happened because none of them saw it. I'm also annoyed that I felt judged by merely asking for details and clarification. To me, that's what I should be doing. Asking questions, finding out what happened, understanding where everyone is coming from. \n\nThe owner added she didn't think the parents of the little boy my son dunked were going to be very happy. If I could have texted her my thoughts, it would have read: \"k.\"\n\nDoes anyone see where I'm coming from?",

            "selftext": "I'm 35 weeks pregnant, and today I had a WIC appointment for my four year old daughter and I. The nurse asked me if I needed help choosing a pump for breastfeeding and I told her no, and when she asked why I told her I planned on formula feeding. She took her glasses off and gave me this weird look and asked me why, and I just told her it was the best choice for us. \n\nSome background: My daughter was breastfed until she was three months away from turning two years old. She self weaned. We didn't pump, we didn't use bottles, she was 100% exclusively breastfed. I DO NOT mention these things to brag, and I want to make it clear that it was horrible. For almost two years, my body was not my own. \n\nWe saw the three lactation nurses our hospital had, we had two opinions from pediatricians that were not our own, and we tried four different breast pumps from three different brands over the course of three months. Eventually the lactation nurses agreed that yeah pumping wasn't gonna work and I could either supplement with formula or continue doing 100% boob. We went 100% boob after only one can of formula because she didn't drink any, it was wasteful, and I would end up losing money that I didn't have. \n\nI ended up doing therapy sessions because I was becoming increasingly irritable, uncomfortable, anxious, and depressed from all the sitting and touching I had to do. I also had a not so lovely childhood trauma that made it hard for me to breastfeed. Being a stay at home mom was the easiest thing I've ever done and I hated it. I wanted to go to school and go to work and I couldn't, and it was becoming difficult to be the mother my daughter needed. Therapy helped us through this. \n\nWhen she weaned, therapy helped us with an unexpected aftermath: how I hated to be touched. I didn't like holding her. I didn't like to be tugged on or climbed on or cuddled or anything. I hated hugging friends and family. I hated sitting next to people. I gritted my teeth and beared it but I was miserable. After being on antidepressants and talking through it every two weeks with my therapist, those thoughts went away. I was happy, hopeful, and ambitious again. I loved to cuddle my daughter and greet everyone I knew with a hug and a NOT FAKE smile. It was great.\n\nNow, I really don't want to explain this to every person, nurse, doctor, whatever every time I mention that I'm formula feeding and I'm not going to unless it's my regular doctor or therapist or my baby's doctor. \n\nSo this is how the rest of our conversation went:\n\nNurse: Why is it the best choice?\n\nMe: Well, it just won't help me be the best mom that I can be. Besides that, I'm going to school this fall and I can't wait to get back to work.\n\nN: There are loads of women in this town that breastfeed and still go to work and still breastfeed so why can't you? What about the baby's father? Can't he just go to work so you can stay home and work on breastfeeding?\n\nMe: We've talked this through and it's the best choice for us. \n\nN: But there are so many benefits to breastfeeding- *pulling out pamphlets*\n\nMe: Oh I know, I breastfed my first for almost two years. \n\nN: So why not this baby?\n\nMe: I said it's not the best choice for us this time.\n\nAfter this I stopped her and asked if we could carry on the appointment and got out of there as quick as I could but it made me feel so uncomfortable. I know I'm going to be questioned a lot about my decision but I'm only going to answer in depth to my therapist and baby's pediatrician. \n\nI don't shame mothers for breastfeeding, especially in public, so I shouldn't be shamed for choosing to formula feed. This is what's best for my family and it's what's best for me to be a good mother and I think that's all that matters in the end.",

            "selftext": "All right, guys, this is a suuuuper long one.  But I honestly don\u2019t know what to do anymore! \n\nI\u2019ll put the TLDR up here for those of you who don\u2019t want to read the entire thing. Quite understandable. If you stick through it all...THANK YOU in advance. \n\nTLDR: MIL has done many questionable things with almost 10month old baby since she was born. Has made me greatly concerned to leave baby alone with her due to safety reasons, but keeps insisting on babysitting. Due to these \u201cquestionable\u201d things, our relationship as MIL and DIL is being strained. \n\nHere it goes...\n\nSo we were initially pumped to have both sets of grandparents fairly close and we thought we were set on babysitters. However, that has most definitely not been the case. My mom is the type of person who is WAY OVER THE TOP protective and paranoid. Sometimes to the point where I\u2019m like \u201cok, mom, baby is ok. The car seat in the other room on the table isn\u2019t going to fall on her\u201d lol But, it attributes to why I am so beyond comfortable leaving the baby with her and, since that\u2019s how I was raised, I\u2019m definitely a little like my mom when it comes to safety. \n\nNow, my MIL ...not so much. All boys have had broken bones, one child ran away with dog when he was like 3 and was lost for a couple of hours, one ended up under a car somehow, another fell down the stairs in his walker...just crazy stuff that I could never imagine happening to me and my siblings. \n\nWhen it comes to our baby, I\u2019m just going to list instances off as best as I can remember them starting from when we first started noticing things.\n\nI had an emergency c section, so when baby was first born, MIL came to stay with us for a week to help with pets, stuff around the house and the baby, of course, while I recovered and got adjusted. \n\nShe would come in to relieve me of the baby so so I could rest, but then I would see her walking around without baby. She would leave the baby on the changing table unattended or downstairs unattended while our two dogs and cat were just roaming around. Now, our pets are amazing, but this would have been the first time around a newborn and I am a STRONG believer of never leaving a small child unattended with animals. Especially a newborn. \n\nMIL later suggested to leave baby on boppy pillow on kitchen table while I got stuff done once I was recovered. She was doing so while I was resting upstairs and she was watching baby. We have a super industrial dining room table on top of hard wood floors. I know newborns are vegetables when so little, but why ontop of a table? \n\nWhen the baby would cry, she would hold baby up to her face and SCREAM in baby\u2019s face. Or baby would be crying in car seat, would get up to baby\u2019s face and scream! She still does this, has never really stopped. \n\nWhen the baby was practicing sitting, so still super duper wobbly, she would leave baby unattended on hard wood floors. Would literally just walk away without a word like \u201chey will someone watch baby?\u201d Just get up, walk away, leave baby alone. \n\nWhen the baby started crawling, MIL would put her straight onto hardwood instead of on rugs. Said it\u2019s okay if baby face plants because she \u201cdoesn\u2019t have teeth yet.\u201d \n\nOne time, she was on the floor with baby and baby was learning to crawl. The baby\u2019s leg got stuck under her and instead of moving it to help her keep moving, she \u201cpushed\u201d baby\u2019s butt and she face planted HARD onto hard wood floor, causing first bump and first bruise. Blamed baby being unsturdy for the fall. \n\nHusband played with baby where he would sit directly in front of couch on floor and baby would sit on edge of couch and wiggle herself into husbands arms. MIL wanted to try and completely did not catch baby. I was sitting next to baby and happened to catch her arm so she didn\u2019t hit floor so hard. But what if I hadn\u2019t been there?\n\nGave baby water balloon and baby didn\u2019t like when it popped and got her wet. So, she went to get another water balloon and the same thing happened. Crying baby. So, her solution is to go get a THIRD water balloon. This was all right before baby was supposed to have her 6 month photo shoot. I had brought her outside for this reason only. Oh and while I\u2019m drying and changing baby into another outfit (thankfully I had a back up picture outfit) she comes over to shoot water on baby from already broken water balloon! Baby is hysterical. \n\nGave baby metal spoon. Baby proceeds to jam it up her throat and gags on it. Then baby throws it. So, the next thing MIL grabs is a KNIFE, shows it to baby and says \u201clike this!\u201d And starts banging it on the table then almost gives it to her!!!! Husband intervened. \n\nGave baby ceramic decor to play with. Baby proceeded to slam it on table. I said \u201chey, MIL, I would hate for that to break\u201d and her response was \u201coh I don\u2019t care. I\u2019ve had that for 15 years!\u201d  I\u2019m not worried about your stupid ceramic rabbit. I\u2019m worried about it breaking and cutting my child. Next time we were over, gave baby another ceramic piece of decor! I had to come over and take that away as well after husband said \u201cit can break and cut her\u201d \n\nSince baby started eating table food, just tries to shovel everything in baby\u2019s mouth, even when baby still has obvious food in her mouth. Literally shovels food in there to stuff her mouth to point where baby is trying to move face away to avoid food being put in mouth\n\nRecently, she was trying to get baby out of high chair without removing tray. Baby is crying because legs are stuck under tray. Instead of removing tray, she continues to try and take baby out! \n\nThe baby was crawling around in loft area, headed straight for stairs. MIL is on the floor, supposed to be playing with/watching  baby...is so checked out talking that she doesn\u2019t even notice.\n\nThese are just a FEW things that stick out atm. Keep in mind my child is almost 10 months old and we hang out with them an average of once a week since baby has been born. Something has happened about 85% of the times we have seen her. Not all of these are safety issues, I\u2019m aware. I think the balloon thing and the screaming are\nmore about my child being comfortable and not annoyed or flustered. \n\nNow, I am okay with things like screen time, for example. We don\u2019t ever do it at our house. MIL loves showing baby her phone. If grandma wants to do that every now and then, so be it. Grandma\u2019s are allowed to do that. Same with giving foods we may not feed or approve of on a regular basis, like cupcakes and Cheetos. The \u201cspoiling\u201d part is what grandmas do.  \n\nI even give her a pass when it comes to pushing things, such as giving my baby a pacifier when she was a newborn. As a brand new mom, I didn\u2019t want to give her a pacifier until we had breastfeeding down, due to nipple confusion. That was my choice. My MIL insisted NON STOP and still does. Even complained to my husband in the beginning because she wanted to be able to comfort baby like I was able to. At this point, baby just never took a pacifier and she is completely fine. \n\nThere\u2019s other things that she tries to push for that we just don\u2019t want to do as parents. However, my point is that things like this aren\u2019t enough to influence the baby because she isn\u2019t raising the baby and they\u2019re not really my issues with her. But, all the safety stuff is what concerns us. \n\nIt\u2019s so bad, that my husband and his brothers have even thought that there is something deeper going on with their mom. Like something health-related. They reached out to his dad about it, but he said everything is fine and that was the end of that. \n\n At this point I would never ever leave my child with her. Even for an hour. And she KEEPS INSISTING and it\u2019s just getting to the point where I ignore her because I do not know what to say. \n\nWe don\u2019t even trust ourselves to go over there alone with baby, as in just my husband and baby to go see grandparents while I get a break or something. We have to double team her as husband and wife to keep an eye on her. It\u2019s like watching an over-excited toddler with a baby, so we\u2019re basically babysitting her and the baby when we go there.\n\n It\u2019s so stressful and we live close, so it\u2019s not like we can avoid it. I am guilty of purposely trying to fill our weekends with plans so we don\u2019t have availability to see her. My husband feels the same on everything except avoiding going over there at least once a week. I totally understand his side, though. She is her grandmother and I cannot keep her from seeing her granddaughter. She has every right to see her and spend time with her. \n\nHowever, I used to enjoy spending time with his family, but she has made it so absolutely stressful and unpleasant, that I am starting to resent her. I am starting to nitpick, for sure. I have caught myself doing it. I can\u2019t help it. I have snapped on her a couple of times now when it comes to baby and it is just so unlike me. I feel like I\u2019m getting close to hitting a breaking point. \n\nWhat do we do, guys?! I\u2019ve suggested to my husband talking to her when I\u2019m not around. But he makes a good point. She is so ridiculously stubborn that she will deny everything and then is the type of person to do certain things just because she\u2019s being told no or otherwise. Not very receptive at all. I don\u2019t want to keep baby from her, but things are getting so awkward with her begging and pushing to babysit.  My husband used to just blame it on me and say that I was super paranoid and just didn\u2019t let anyone watch the baby. It was an essay excuse for the time being. However, you can only keep that lie going for so long. At this point she is aware that my mom watches the baby when we need a sitter. To top it all off, all of this is putting a huuuuge strain on our DIL-MIL relationship. \n\nSo, AITA for not letting my MIL babysit?\n\nIf you made it this far, thank you x infinity! I know it was super duper long, but I needed to rant and get it off my chest. I need clarity from different viewpoints. First time moms, moms with multiples, grandmas...everything! \n\nAre we being crazy first time parents? Are justified? Advice? Similar stories?!",

            "selftext": "New here...\n\nSoon to be first time mom, baby due in November,  I will also be turning 39 shortly before his birth. I just found out that my MIL and my husband's godmother will be paying for/hosting my baby shower. To which I am super thankful! \n\nI don't have a ton of girlfriends, and my closest family lives many states away and with the exception of my sister, no one has been jumping to offer to help plan anything. My family is small and doesn't family well.\n\nI should also prefice this post by stating I suffer from Anxiety and have being taking meds to help manage my anxiety for several years now. Pretty sure the anxiety problems run in the family. (Fun times)\n\nDue to a thyroid problem, I truly didn't think that i would be in the position I currently find myself. While I am not at all unhappy with the situation and have been having a relatively easy pregnancy, I know that I don't like being the center of attention, I also struggle with the idea of people/friends/family (which I have to invite to this shower) buying expensive things for my little growing family because I had sex with husband.\n\nI know, I know,... and have been told from everyone that I'm looking at the situation the wrong way. \n\n\nI guess what I'm asking is there another way to look at this, a perspective that my irrational brain can come to that will allow me to be less anxious, and not so judgemental towards my very sweet/only wants to be helpful MIL?\n\nI also understand  that we can't afford to buy everything on our own. So the fact that husband's family is being generous doesn't go unnoticed. So the phrase \"it takes a village\" is understandable.\n\nMy rational brain can understand that we can't afford all these things that a baby needs, but part of my older more stubborn self is also like why do we need all this stuff. I want to listen to the wisdom for been there, done that mom's because I don't know what I'm doing. But the irrational part of my brain says well you'll figure it out on your own the way you have the whole of your life. Like somehow since I made it this far on my own I can do this first time motherhood business on my own too. Not once until this moment has my rational brain even thought \"why would you even want to do this on your own?\" Like I don't have a choice? (Silly brain)\n\nWhy can't I truly believe and understand that this sweet little baby deserves all the nice things and all the love I feel like I never got? I don't want my little boy to miss out on the love and caring friends and family we have in our lives because I didn't have the greatest upbringing. I know that currently I'm allowing my anxiety to make irrational decisions/ formulate thoughts for me and the baby, and that aren't fair. \n\nI'm sure I'm working through somethings that needs some professional talk therapy. But suggestions or advise is always welcome.\n\nAlso what advise can you give about inviting close friends that live out of state. \n\nIn the age of social media and sharing it's hard to know who is really happy for you that you're having a baby...like how much are they willing to participate, and should I even assume that they would want to.\n\n\nHoping to figure this out before September \ud83d\ude2c.\n\nThanks a bunch!",

            "selftext": "Not sure if this is the place to post this story, but I am completely heart broken for a family friend of mine. \n\nShe had a beautiful baby girl last week. She has also been having difficulty breastfeeding. The lactation consultant in the hospital she was at apparently told her it was normal after a C-section to have a delay with milk coming in but that her colostrum was enough(which coukd be true for some). They also refused to give the baby formula. She grew a bit concerned at how fussy her baby was, but again was told she was fine. Being fussy is normal. A little weight loss is normal. Oh and don't forget to just keep latching and do not use any formula. \n\nThe next day they discharged them to go home. She said she was still struggling with feeding and felt baby was getting enough, but carried on since everyone told her it was normal and fine. That night they went to the ER with a floppy baby and discovered she was extremely dehydrated. The ER doc started her on formula right away and immediately asked for where she eas discharged from and said they needed to file a complaint. \n\nThe baby is completely fine but I cannot stop thinking about the whole situation. My heart breaks that she now has the memory of seeing her daughter like that. \n\nAt what point do we stop and recognize there might just be a toxic mindset around \"baby friendly\" hospitals, or at least certain staff. I even got side eyed from an LC when I signed to have my baby supplemented; \"you know breastmilk is better.\" \"I'm pretty sure fed is better than nothing if I'm having issues, thanks.\" Why do these lactation consultants seem to always be rude and dismissive? Why aren't brand new moms getting better support instead of having  their concerns brushed off?",

            "selftext": "Hey moms I'm having a hard time right now. My daughter is one and a half and she's an absolute nightmare. She hits me and throws stuff at me. She's constantly getting into everything. She screams and has meltdowns in public. I try to engage with her by playing with her but she ends up hitting me or throwing toys at me. She threw her breakfast on the floor this morning. I take her to mommy and me classes and she kicks and screams when I'm getting her to participate..she just wants to run around. I've tried different things but nothing is helping. It's to the point where I wake up dreading my day with her and count down the minutes until my husband gets home. I do love my daughter but I just don't like her very much at this stage. I understand she's going into being a toddler and some of this behavior is part for the course but it doesn't make it any easier. I feel very guilty for feeling this way but I'm just tired ....any body else feel similar?",

Watching the news with the toddler who fell to her death from the cruise ship is crushing me emotionally. I can\u2019t even imagine what her parents and grandparents are going through. The feeling is so harrowing, though it wasn\u2019t my child I feel like I am in mourning. \n\nI feel anger towards the shitty mom who left her 4 year old in a hot car as punishment, and died. The migrant children is an entirely new rant. Local story in Montana here last summer where a man left a 6mo out in the woods, naked and alone and, by sheer fate, was found by two police officers. I feel so overwhelmed. Even a movie gets to me, specifically \u201cThe Homesman\u201d. It\u2019s not real, but I have spoken to my therapist about it many times. \n\nI feel so tired. Tired of feeling every day the weight of all the children who are so vulnerable. The tragedies and short lives they\u2019ve lived, with scary and unknown endings. \n\nPlease tell me I\u2019m not alone.",

            "selftext": "     April 7, 2019 was an exciting day, the day we would be welcoming our third and final child, a boy. His name had been chosen, his brothers were excited for his arrival, and his father and I beamed with pride in route to the hospital. As most inductions go, it was a long day, we waited and waited until it was finally time to meet our boy. At 3:40 pm, he was here, I laughed and cried and couldn\u2019t believe I had once again brought a beautiful life into this world. \n     The normal things happened, tests were ran, he passed them all, and we were sent home after 24 hours. As we got home we learned quickly that life with three boys was crazy, hectic, and that we felt more love than we had ever felt before. Our puzzle of a family was complete with it\u2019s final piece finally making its way into our home. Everything was wonderful, tiring, and exciting. \n    He functioned normally for the first three days. He ate, pooped, peed, slept, repeat. It became monotonous, but I loved every moment of time I had with my darling new boy. After day 7, I became concerned as he was no longer stooling, every doctor told me this could be normal in a breastfed baby, I listened. It wasn\u2019t until a visit with my lactation consultant, who looked him over and said she could hear great bowel sounds and didn\u2019t see an immediate issue, told me about her time as a nicu nurse and told me that if he started throwing up feces... we had an issue. But she wholeheartedly didn\u2019t believe it would happen, as she had seen it once in her 20+ years. \n    At 11 days old, he threw up bright green. Then he kept throwing up and he refused to feed. I immediately contacted his pediatrician and told them our issues. They worked us into their schedule immediately. After arriving, he seemed to get worse, the throwing up increased and it became the brightest shade of green I have ever seen. I was terrified. \n     His pediatrician seemed concerned but not enough to instill unnecessary fear until she knew for sure what our next steps would be. She took us to an X-ray and told me she was going to call the surgery team at our local children\u2019s hospital to see if they had suggestions. Before our X-ray was done, she was in the radiology area, telling me we needed to sit and have a talk. (Not necessarily what you want to hear about your eleven day old.)\n    She explained to me that the surgery team thought our son may have a bowel obstruction and that we needed to drive to our local hospital for an IV and an NG tube followed by a transfer to the children\u2019s hospital. I instantly filled with heat. I couldn\u2019t even cry. I whisked him away with out a word, but as soon as the air from outside hit my face, tears came. What does this all mean? Is he going to be okay? What\u2019s wrong with my baby?\n     After a long drive that seemed to take forever, we made it to the children\u2019s hospital after our short trip to our local. They immediately started looking for a place to put an IV as his tiny veins were shriveled up and he was extremely dehydrated. They took us for barium enemas, xrays, did blood labs, and finally admitted us to the NICU. He finally got his IV in the nicu. His enema showed radiologists that he had \u201cmega colon\u201d which is the main sign of a disease called Hirschsprung\u2019s. The radiologist said it out loud and I never realized that it would change my life forever. \n     The next day, he had a bedside rectal biopsy, then a perc line placed, and finally after many attempts at irrigating our dear boy and it failing... his biopsy reports came back. He was two weeks old when he was diagnosed with Hirschsprung\u2019s disease. Hirschsprung\u2019s is defined by missing ganglion cells in the colon and small intestine that make it impossible for stool to come out. He was scheduled to surgery to place an ostomy the very next day. \n     His surgery started at 1:30 pm, he was in for 5.5 hours before the surgeon came to give us his report. Our sons entire colon was useless. He was then considered total colonic Hirschsprung\u2019s. Hirschsprungs itself is 1 in 5000 babies born, typically males, and is considered a genetic disease. Having total colonic Hirschsprung\u2019s made him even more of a rarity. \n     He handled surgery well, we had a total of 14 days staying at the children\u2019s hospital before we went home. After returning home, things were amazing for about 3.5 weeks, until they weren\u2019t. Our boy had an obstruction due to too much scar tissue in his small intestine from the last surgery. So now the ileostomy I had just gotten used to being on the right side of his belly, was now rerouted to his left. \n    My life has become a constant blur of hospital stays, ostomy care, and learning the ins and outs of caring for a medically needy child. I love this boy more than words can say, he is so very special to me and while he will have an ileostomy likely for the rest of his life and we still haven\u2019t gotten him to a perfect and comfortable place... I\u2019m working my hardest to find answers for him. \n\n\nTL:DR-Our son was born with a genetic intestinal disease called Hirschsprung\u2019s and had his colon removed at two weeks old, had an ileostomy placed and ended up having another surgery to reroute his ileostomy 3.5 weeks later. We still don\u2019t have all the answers but hope to soon.",

Like leperchauns (who visited our house on St Patrick\u2019s day and turned furniture upside down) fairy godmothers, tree nymphs, Cyclopes, dragons, Narnia (sooooo many hours trying to find a wardrobe), and Santa. So I never asked. And sometimes he even sent a letter back and left it at our house with the presents. I just assumed of course it was all plausible (also thought my toys were alive...thanks Toy Story for the trauma of that first garage sale). I would argue back with kids at school about it. Until I was in 6th grade! I felt like such an idiot when my parents told me the truth (though I still love reading fantasy, so you win some you lose some?).\n\nSo, what would be an approach to Santa/tooth fairy/etc. that doesn\u2019t involve your sixth grader being a total dork like I was? I don\u2019t regret believing in fantasy...I just wish I hadn\u2019t come across as so naive to literally everyone else.",

            "selftext": "TLDR: Im looking for tips to remove myself more from the non-fun parenting stuff and putting more of that on my husband\n\nI'm feeling really overwhelmed by being the parent that worries about the details and logistics of everything. Example: my husband is great about getting the kids out for adventures outside, I just feel like I do all the not fun parts. The other day he takes them on a very long hike while I packed up our house for move. If our daughter doesn't poop by about 2:00 it will start to leak out and she gets constipated. They got back around 7 pm and of course she had not pooped and had probably been walking around with skid marks in her underwear for awhile. So of course she gets a bladder infection and is dealing with that the whole drive across country when we're moving. And guess who has to deal with finding an urgent Care, getting her to take her antibiotics, getting her to drink water, making sure she's peeing even though it hurts, making sure she poops and drinks lots of apple juice so she can poop. Then I need to make sure she takes a probiotic so she doesn't get a yeast infection. \n\nWhat tips do you have for getting your partner to engage in this stuff more? I'm so tired of being the bad guy who cleans up messes. I get it from his perspective, if someone else was doing all the worrying, I'd sit back and do the fun stuff too. But if I just don't engage and let things run their course, then we end up with bigger messes that I get to clean up",

            "selftext": "This is a question to the moms that used to breastfeed their babies/toddlers but have since stopped:\n\nHow have your breasts changed since you stopped breastfeeding compared to before your pregnancy/pregnancies?\n\nThe reason I am asking this is because I have a really hard time coming to terms with how my breasts look now... Before my pregnancy I had a pretty average B cup which I was quite proud of. During pregnancy and breastfeeding, they grew to a C cup and when my baby slowly stopped drinking milk after almost a year, they dwindled down to A cups. Actually I don't mind the cup size, it's more the fact that they are really sagging now and feel so empty (not only compared to when I was breastfeeding but also before pregnancy). Will this change? We only stopped breastfeeding about a month ago, so I still have some hope... Is there anything I can do to help make my breasts get more firm again (sports etc.)?\n\nNote: This should not be a discussion about how long you should breastfeeding, I also do not regret breastfeeding because of how my body looks now. As I said, I really liked my breasts before the pregnancy and don't really like what I see in the mirror at the moment. And please don't say \"you should be proud of your body, it did an amazing job\" - yes I know, still I want to feel like a woman and not only a mom.",

FYI I had no idea she had even dropped her toy, she didn't say anything. \nShe began unbuckling her car seat as we were driving and I heard the the click of seat and asked what was going on and my 8 year old told me his sister was taking her buckles off. I told her to stop immediately stay sitting back in her seat. Luckily we were on a road directly in front of a grocery store so I turned straight in and parked. I got out of the car and went to the back and began to re buckle her in the seat and explain to her that she can never unbuckle while we are driving. While I was strapping her in the seat there was a car near us and they began filming me on their phone and yelling at me saying I was stupid and they just kept driving around my car filming me and yelling. \n\nWhile I feel like I did the right thing for the safety of my child I can't help but feel super upset that they did that to me. I have never been shamed as a mother before and I must say it really hurts. It really bothers me that this video might be on the internet for people to see...",

Apologies to anyone seeing this a second time!\n\nOne year ago, I made the decision to be a surrogate for a lovely couple in New York to help pay off my student loans from grad school and start saving up for a home. I'm a single mother in my 30s with a child of my own living in North Carolina. I really wanted a way to get some extra income and help someone else in the process. I'm posting this because I searched Reddit for posts from other women who did something like this and I can't really find any, so hopefully this helps a few other women make the decision whether to make a choice like mine. Overall, I think it's one of the best decisions I've ever made.\n\nIt wasn't an easy decision, but it helped that the process wasn't as hard as I thought. (Just long!)\n\nI spent a lot of time researching the various agencies and the one I chose\\* paid the most I could find for a first-time surrogate. The couple I was matched up with is really nice. I got to meet them in New York City a couple times when I flew up there during the medical clearance process and embryo implantation. (My expenses were paid for too, so I got to visit New York for free!) They're both sweet and loving... I'm glad I could help. The poor wife has had a really hard time conceiving, with several heartbreaking experiences, over the last several years....\n\nI'm currently 33 weeks along and I've had a easy pregnancy so far. I'm so excited for them to meet their new baby in August. (And because the embryo was developed from the husband's sperm and the wife's egg, the baby will be genetically theirs 100%.) I can tell they're really excited! The wife texts me all the time to see how I'm doing, and she likes to send me food. (She's really generous!)\n\nOn that note, let me tell you some of the requirements I had to meet to qualify. They weren't that hard.\n\n* You should be between 21-39 years old.\n* With my agency, you need a BMI between 18-32\n* You can't be on government financial support (Like food stamps or other programs)\n* You need to have given birth to and be raising at least one child\n\nAfter paying my student loans off in full this month, I am putting the rest of the money towards a down payment on a house. That money buys a lot of house in my area. :)\n\nIt hasn't all been an easy process. These are the main drawbacks/cons I've run into so far:\n\nCons:\n\n* Getting approved and implanted took a long time - 8 months in my case. There were payments for getting matched with parents and getting cleared medically, but the monthly surrogacy payments didn't start until after the fetal heartbeat was confirmed a second time. There was a lot of waiting. (Worth it!)\n* I had to inject myself once a day for about six weeks. I'm not a fan of needles so the first few were tough. After a week I got used to it, and after a couple of weeks it become completely routine. It's really not that bad.\n* Lots of tests and appointments before I was approved. Thankfully, I work from home (I'm a translator), so I had the flexibility to get the testing done on their schedule.\n* For three weeks I had to go to a nearby fertility clinic to get a blood draw 2x a week. Once I actually got pregnant, it went down to just the standard pregnancy OB appointments.\n\nHere are the top positive aspects for me:\n\nPros:\n\n* The couple are really nice and loving, and I love how I'm able to help them with something they are so excited about.\n* I got to fly to NYC a couple times during the process.\n* Easy pregnancy (in my case - I know I'm super lucky here!) that's over in about 9 months.\n* I'm getting paid $50,000+ in total which covered my student loans, helps me take care of my little girl, and goes a long way towards a house here.\n\nReally, it was one of the best decisions I think I've ever made. Those student loans were a huge burden. I was worried I\u2019d never be able to be a home owner and take care of my daughter. I can\u2019t even describe the difference it made in our lives... and more importantly, the difference it's going to make in the lives of the couple I matched with. I managed to get it all taken care of while helping a great family finally have the child they've wanted for years.\n\nIf you have any questions for me, feel free to ask!\n\n(\\*I didn't include any personal information here, like which agency I'm working through, but if you want to know any personal details, I'm happy to discuss over PMs.)",

            "selftext": "Just had my little's two year check up and the doctor asked what kind of milk he drinks. He recently self-weaned, so every once in a while when he asks I give him organic grass-fed whole milk because it's what I keep in the house and is much easier for both him and I to digest. We're talking maybe a 1/4 to 1/2 cup of milk 1 to 3 times a week, sometimes not at all. \n\nThe doctor said I should be giving him nonfat or 1%, not whole, and that he should get 3 cups a day. I love his doctor, but I wanted to be snarky and tell him over his dead body unless he wants to change those diapers and blowouts that will surely result! \n\nAnyone know what the reasoning is behind the recommendation for milk? Is the idea to reduce calories and fat? If so, can't I meet that goal by giving him less in quantity? If he truly needs milk for nutrition (which I am convinced he does not and can meet those needs in other ways), wouldn't whole milk have more of it? \n\nI just know my body and my life are happier with whole milk. Without whole milk, I had to cut out dairy almost completely. Plus, it really helps with bloating and blood sugar. I hate to subject my kid to that suffering. It almost seems like the 90's fear-mongering that fat in foods will make you fat. Other mommas, what is your take? Have your doctors advised the same?\n\nTl,dr; Pediatrician says whole milk is bad and to give huge quantities of nonfat or 1% instead of whole. Where does this idea come from?",

            "selftext": "Hey there Mommit!\n\nFirst time poster and on mobile, so I apologize for any wonky formatting issues.\n\nLike the title says, my two year old son is obsessed with wearing dresses. It began about 6 months ago with him touching my hair and saying that he too wanted long hair and wearing towels and scarves on top of his head to mimic longer hair. I thought it was cute and certainly didn't discourage it - I often helped him create a little \"up-do\" or tie the scarf in a ponytail.\n\nSince then, he has become increasingly interested in princesses and dresses. I bought him a Moana dress - which he loved and never ever wanted to take off - and I've since bought him a \"normal\" simple girly dress from Target. Every time we let him wear it, his eyes light up and I swear he gets this quiet confidence and just swells with pride when he sees himself in it in the mirror. He will say \"look! I'm so beautiful!\" Or \"I am a princess\" or even \"I am a girl!\" This is usually quite adorable but at the same time I never thought about how I would react or parent a child who enjoyed traditionally opposite-gendered clothing. When he's not in his own dresses, he is begging to wear one of my shirts (long enough to be a dress on him) and screams for hours if I have to take off his dress to wash it.\n\nWe have taken him out to the park and library in his dress and he has a blast. We've gotten a few people asking how old \"she\" is, etc and I just answer and don't really correct them or go on about it. He has a fairly masculine name and an older brother so I'm sure when I refer to them as brothers or call him by name it can be confusing.\n\nI haven't been able to talk about this much - my husband is kind of uncomfortable with it but isn't banning it - he's just kind of letting me take the reigns.\n\nAnyone else's boy kiddo into dresses? Or vice versa? I love my son whether he remains my son or eventually becomes my daughter, I just want to parent him in these early years the best that I can. Should I overhaul his wardrobe to that of girlier fashions? Save the dresses for special occasions? Let him wear dresses as long as they are strictly \"costumes\" (husband's idea)? Encourage it when he says he's a princess or girl? Am I just totally overthinking this because he's only 2 and still poops in a diaper and barely knows his middle name!? Haha any advice would be helpful , with the exception of hateful, angry or transphobic advice of course! Thanks for reading!!",

Now, when Daniel is upset, he growls. And of course, this week my toddler has started \u201cgrowling\u201d when he gets upset. He even says, \u201cI\u2019m growling because I am mad, like Daniel Tiger growls when he\u2019s mad.\u201d As of now, there is little to no inclination towards also \u201cuse his words\u201d like Daniel does. :\u2019(",

I just started a new job a few months ago and feel like I should be a little more established in the company before taking maternity leave. On top of that we have a trip planned with my family to Costa Rica in December and I am afraid to be pregnant on that trip because of the zicca virus so that puts it off until next March (they say it takes 3 months to get rid of zicca in the sperm). I would like to go on the trip since I dont see my family often but I wish they would have picked a different location. What I am struggling with is that I dont think I can wait a year plus nine months to be a mom. I am worried that things are going to keep coming up and getting in the way, at what point do you say now is the time? Did anyone have to miss events because of their pregnancy?",

Do any of you have problematic grandmas and what have you done?\n\nMy DD is only 3 months old, but I fear that my mother can become an issue in the future. She talks alot about having her come over for visits alone when DD is older, and it's not like I wish to rob my daughter of her grandparents.\n\nProblem is, my mother is not a very considerate person. She isn't abusive, but she doesn't seem to mind saying things to people that are downright hurtful. Growing up I got told that I wasn't as intelligent as my sister and she would make remarks at my weight unprovoked (mind you, not in a helpful way, but rather \"you can't wear a shirt like that when you have such chubby arms\" if I wore a sleeveless shirt). She has also made some very rude comments about my DH when he wasn't present, and if you point out that something is rude of her to say, she will just brush it off saying that it is meant to be helpful and never apologizes. \n\nI fear that she may talk in the same way to my DD   when she grows up if DD somehow doesn't adhere to her \"standards\". If I'm there I can tell my mother off, but is there a way to catch it if my mother will be like that when I'm not around? As in, how do I know if my mother says things to DD she shouldn't be saying? Have any of you had this issue?",

            "selftext": "I went in for my dilation check today at 40+3. No dilation, no effacement, no pre-contractions yet. \n\nOB says that they are moving the labor wing next week and they will be in transition between the two floors. She wants me there at 6am tomorrow to start a pictocin IV for induction. \n\nI don't feel like I'm ready. I feel completely normal. I am not physically uncomfortable in anyway. I have normal blood pressure, baby is still moving regularly, I measure on target. There is zero medical reason for me to be induced. It's purely because of the move. \n\nThat's not to say that it's not a good reason. I understand that staff is going to still be getting their barings during this time. I've worked with the public and I know that I'm not aware of all the behind the scenes work that they put into everything. I'm sure it would be so much smoother for them if I go in before the move.\n\nBut according to the all mighty internet and my birthing class medically induced labor patients are 3 times more likely to have an C-section. Pair that with the C-section rates at my hospital are higher than the US average and it seems highly likely that I would get one. (Major surgery for the convenience of others isn't something that sounds great to me)\n\nI'm scared. I told my OB that I would prefer to wait a week but she didn't accept that and said that tomorrow would be best. I appreciate her transparency buy it really frazzled me.\n\nI left a message for my OB after dwelling on it for a few hours and said that I won't be going in for the induction tomorrow. \n\n\n\n\nTLDR: No medical reason to be induced. OB despite my wishes scheduled me for 6am induction because it's what's easiest for staff since labor wing is moving to another floor. Im nervous/uncomfortable and left a message for my OB cancelling my induction. \n\n\n\nDid I do the wrong thing?",

So one day last week, they asked for a banana, a mandarin orange, bell pepper, and oyster crackers. \n\nThat evening, my husband asked them what they had for lunch, and he wasn't happy when he heard the answer. \"That's not healthy, and mommy should know better than to give it to you.

Its a struggle. My next docotors appointment is in 6 days and i plan on speaking with my OB about all of this but in the mean time i would really like some advice from some people who have been tmhere before. I know im not the only one lol\n\nI have tried crackers, gingerale, lemon water, peppermint, and have recently had someone suggest a seaband (ever heard of it?)\n\nAt this point i would do the hokey pokey and turn myself around if you said it would help!

We do so much to try to help patients during pregnancy, but after delivery, often they are left unsure about what to expect, what's normal and abnormal, and how to manage. What surprised you most about delivery and the postpartum period, what didn't your OB/Gyn or midwife prepare you for, and what would be your best advice for a person who has recently delivered a baby?

I can\u2019t find anywhere on the internet that reflects what I\u2019m about to say, oddly. \nI have no friends who are fellow parents. Of my single friends, many have begun adopting antinatalist philosophies (the view that it\u2019s wrong to have children). They will sit in my house and share these views and then add, as an afterthought, \u201coh not you though. I don\u2019t mean to shame people who do have children\u201d. Well... yes they do though. As the movement is founded on moral grounds that appears to be the entire point. It\u2019s hard enough as a mother to be judged for every microdecision of parenting. Now the shaming of mothers is taken even further. To me this is anti-feminist to the core. I\u2019ve been reading about it everywhere I go online as well. I guess a lot of my hobbies and interests (like art) are not shared by parents but rather by childfree people. That in itself is not an issue to me at all, but it sucks to have people who I thought were my friends or peers essentially telling me my life is morally wrong. It has me feeling very isolated and I guess I just hope there is someone out there who can relate. ",

            "selftext": "Every hotel I've stayed in days pack and plays aren't guaranteed, that you can only request them. I get it: you have a limited number of pack and plays. The rationale im given is that they give them out on a first-come-first-served basis. But you also have a limited number of rooms and beds. If you have five rooms, and five people make a reservation for a particular night, you wouldn't rent a sixth room to a sixth person online. If you have five pack and plays, and six people request them when they make their reservation for a given night, you shouldn't allow the sixth person to complete the reservation with the pack and play request! There is simply no reason why you can't track the availability of pack and plays the same way you track the availability of rooms and beds. The concept is the same: if you don't have anywhere for me to sleep, I can't stay in your hotel, and if you don't have anywhere for my baby to sleep, I can't stay in your hotel. I'm not cosleeping with my toddler on a bed four feet off the ground, and I'd prefer not to put her on the floor, either. We are paying for a room we can all sleep in. Why is this so hard? Babies and toddlers need beds the same way adults need beds! You'd never tolerate it if you showed up at the hotel and they said, yes, we have a room for you, but unfortunately all the beds are taken, so we don't have a bed for you. FFS.",

My husband said he is open to the idea but that I would have to give up my job and be a SAHM to do that. I have no issues being a SAHM, but I do like my job (hate the company, like the work) and I\u2019m fearful about what kind of hit our retirement would take if I did that. We could afford childcare for two children but it would be really tight. The biggest reason he said that is that when our son was born I worked 3pm to 11pm so he had the baby almost every evening by himself and that was a really hard time for him. But when I was home it was a lot easier for him. So he told me he is fine with having a second child as long as I am home. What would you guys do? \n\n",

But as an added precaution, referred us to a pediatrician in case there was something he wasn't thinking of.\n\n\nWe have our appointment this week with the pediatrician, a woman in her late 50's. She runs through an whole list of questions about my son and our medical and family histories.\n\n\nShe determines things are normal with my son, and then proceeds to ask \"so, when are you having your next child?\" \n\n\nNow, I'm insanely used to this question. I've heard it practically weekly since my son was born, but I was taken aback hearing it from a medical professional.\n\n\nSo I give my standard answer \"oh, we're only having one. He keeps us busy enough as it is. I can't imagine having more!\" This usually suffices. \n\n\nBut she kept going!!! \"What? You NEED to give him a sibling. I see so many bad parents who have too many kids. Good parents like you need to have more! 4 is the best number. 2 girls and 2 boys is perfect......\" she went on for a while. ALL IN FRONT OF MY SON!\n\n\nI just kept repeating myself and reaffirming our decision. But inside, I kept switching between wanting to punch her and wanting to cry. I actually would love another, but my husband is firmly one and done. I love our family and it's taken me a lot of reflecting to be happy with what we have and come to terms with not having another. This woman was singlehandedly unraveling years of emotional work.\n\n\nI'm going to tell my sons normal dr about it and hopefully he stops referring future patients to her. \n\n\nI don't know why I'm writing this. I think I just need to vent.",

            "selftext": "Yesterday my daughters school called and said she didn\u2019t show up to PE after they left music they found her at her desk with her head down sleeping. Couldn\u2019t get her to open her eyes or talk to anyone. She would flinch away if you punched or tickled her, would stand, grab for stuff, etc. well I get there and take her to the ER. A few minutes after we get to the ER she opens her eyes starts talking, is completely fine. Neuro check was fine so they didn\u2019t do a scan. Don\u2019t think anything medical is going on. The doctor seems to think either A) she fell asleep, was embarrassed so she acted like she was still sleeping, got super embarrassed and didn\u2019t know how to get out of said situation when people started to get worried. Or B ) she wanted to get out of school and is pretty smart for a 7 year old. I asked her if anything is bothering her at school or if anyone is being mean or anything and asked her if anything is bothering her at home and she says no. \nShe has a tic where she blinks frequently and her teacher called me yesterday and said it has been worse at school the last week or 2. So I took her to her regular doctor today. Her doctor is not concerned and also thinks she was just faking it. She also asked all kinds of questions about school as well as doing a neuro exam and said that all seems fine. Suggested that maybe I try a low dose of melatonin and see if that improves her tic at all suggesting maybe she\u2019s just tired. \nI am completely satisfied by these answers however I had missed the original school call (immediately called back) but the next person on the list to call was my mom so by the time I got to the school she was also there (in complete hysterics, because she makes everything crazy) and she\u2019s convinced that something is medically going on. \nSo I guess I\u2019m just asking if anyone has had any similar situations? \nShe\u2019s acted completely fine since the incident by the way, no concerning behaviors at all.

As beautiful and addicting as my baby and our time together is, my partner is having such a hard time understanding how my hormones effect my day to day wellbeing and patience and overall happiness. We\u2019ve been struggling so much since baby came being that postpartum depression hit me pretty hard and my attitude has been less than kind or patient with him. It\u2019s so frustrating because he just simply doesn\u2019t GET what this is like; what the constant worry is like, what the exhaustion with breastfeeding is like, he doesn\u2019t experience these emotions. I know having mom friends would be good for me and being around female energy is something I\u2019m seriously lacking but other moms are so hard to relate to. \n\nI\u2019m convinced that (in my experience at least) dad doesn\u2019t truly bond with baby until baby becomes a bit more independent of me, dad hardly even holds baby or feels comfortable being alone with him because baby tends to cry right away being that dad doesn\u2019t fully understand his cues or what he likes. On top of the typical anxiety and stress of being a new mother I constantly worry when baby\u2019s alone with dad. Not that he\u2019s incompetent or careless, he loves our son every bit as much as I do, he just seems to have less patience and is not as attentive as I am. Lately he seems to just want to bring baby to the nanny when I\u2019m gone, I can tell baby\u2019s discomfort with him is giving him a lot of anxiety. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do to help dad feel better around baby and also to stop breathing down dad\u2019s neck every time he\u2019s alone with little one. I feel like I\u2019m going crazy waiting for something terrible to happen when I\u2019m at work during the day. Really struggling here. ",

Don't retract, don't try to clean inside, just let it be. But after his 16-month well-child, his pediatrician started retracted him and saying that it wasn't normal that he wasn't retracting yet. She said if he isn't fully retracting by 2 years, she will refer him to get circumcised. She already had to send an 8 year old and it wasn't pretty. His dad (my fiance) is agreeing with her and wants to start retracting him to avoid a circumcision, as well as to keep him clean. He says it can't be clean enough just wiping the outside. \n\nIf I get him circumcised now, will it be ok? Are there any benefits if I do? Should I just start retracting him to avoid one? ",

We have been trying for a whole year with 2 major regressions and half success with peeing, zero success with pooping. She keeps her panties dry at half-day school from wake up til 1 pm. Then she comes home and makes it rain. You name it, we have tried it. Stickers, bribes, prizes, charts, time-outs, timers, pantsless, giving up and trying again later, etc. She is on daily miralax for constipation. She won\u2019t tell us most of the time when she\u2019s wet or has poop. She hides it, lies about it, and prefers a pull-up so she can do it in her pants at home. She is defiant when we make her \u201ccheck her body\u201d and it is an hourly battle. She is developing typically and is otherwise smart and kind. We have done OT and ST evals and therapy for extreme pickiness with food. They say be patient. Please spare me with the \u201cshe won\u2019t go to college in diapers\u201d, it\u2019s no comfort to me. I don\u2019t know what to do anymore. This has been the hardest trial of motherhood for me - I just want her to go in the potty at home like she does at school. ",

I am either always the one holding the camera/taking the pics or only my arm is in the shot holding my babies. It especially bothers me that no visitors took my picture with the babies when I was at the hospital or in those early weeks at home. Yes, I know I have a voice and should have asked and I'm doing that now, but I had just delivered twins and felt like I had been hit by a train so that was not the first thing on my mind. I was still smiling though and would have loved pics with my babies. If I'm holding them.. why not include me in a few pics? 6 months later and I still have to ask others to include me in at least a few pics. I don't need or want to be in all of them, but how rude to keep cutting out the mother. My MIL is a photographer so I think that's why it especially bothers me. Even a family member's girlfriend has more pics with my babies than me. \n\nOk... Rant over.\n\nJust wanted to know if it's just me and to remind other moms to make sure they are not forgotten in their children's future photo albums. \n\n",

One person insisted that he\u2019s probably having a growth spurt and NEEDS extra milk. \n\nThis literally happens all the time. I would have just finished feeding him and someone will pop over (our parents, friends, siblings etc) to visit and the moment he pulls a face or grizzles they tell me he\u2019s starving and I should feed him. I also feel like they don\u2019t believe me when I say he isn\u2019t. \n\nIt\u2019s really really really annoying! He\u2019s a massively chunky baby that clearly not underfed so why do they do this??

            "selftext": "I've posted here before about my situation, and it's gotten worse-to the point where I think I may have PPD. Maybe I'm ignorant, but I didn't think it was as normal to be diagnosed with PPD  so late. My son is now 12 weeks old, 10 weeks adjusted, and he literally has never smiled for me. He's always all smiles for his grandma. This morning, after he woke up, I was playing for him and he was crying and pouting. The moment he went to his grandma, he started smiling and vocalizing. My MIL (his grandma) doesn't speak a lot of English, so she doesn't understand when I tell her I want my baby to play with him during the day.  She literally has him all day and gives him to me during the night and for feedings. I have tried to tell her that I want my baby, and I'll get him for 10 minutes and she will ask for him back. It's been so tough to the point where I'm in tears several times a day. I've brought it up with my husband, and he tries to reassure me that our son is still a baby and doesn't know how to express himself. He doesn't think I need to speak to someone because I'm overreacting. I don't know what to do. I feel like I don't even have my baby on my side. I can't talk to someone, because when I bring it up to my husband, he says that he doesn't think I need to. I've thought about talking to someone behind his back, but he will see the insurance claim. I can't afford to pay for someone on my own since all of our money is in a joint account. I feel like my hands are tied. Will it get better? What do I do? What am I doing wrong? I need help. I'm in tears as I write this. ",

She was tested positive for peanut, dairy, and egg whites allergy. \n\nWe haven't gotten her tested for tree nuts but it's possible she might be allergic. I still breastfeed her and I've been trying to introduce her to other kinds of milk. I tried almond milk and she rejected it so I assumed maybe it was making her mouth itchy or something. I'm trying soy milk right now but she only takes a few sips and as soon as she finds out what's in the bottle, she stops drinking. Next on my list is to try rice or coconut milk. Has any of you had success? \n\nAs for solids, she is getting bored of the same food being offered. I mostly give her fruits, veggies, chicken, tofu and rice. I've given her egg free pasta and she doesn't eat it. She also rejected oatmeal. I really need suggestions on some other foods I can give to her. Please help. I will be forever grateful. ",

She nurses for naps(sometimes to sleep,sometimes just drowsy) but it is separated from bedtime by about half hour or so. We do dinner, nurse, bath, story, song, sleep. She may fuss for a minute or 2 but goes down really well and settles herself fairly easily at bedtime and naptimes. \n\nThe problem is that despite the sleep training and good sleep habits I've been working on for months,she is still up every 2 to 3 hours or so overnight. I try to let her settle herself if she wakes up and sometimes she does and sometimes she doesn't -i usually go in if it takes longer than 20 to 30 mins in the middle of the night, depending on whether she is disturbing my son, how long it has been since her last wake up and how close to getting up time it is but she is more consistent with not settling than she is with actually settling in the night time. \n\nI feel like I'm doing it right but it's just not working. Is this just my life now?  \nAny advice or experiences are helpful.",

I appreciate it because I'm definitely sleep deprived, but I'm worried that my baby won't know that I'm his mom.

However, my husband refuses to get up for any night feeds and is now starting to refuse taking the 6am feed before he goes to work. Which means I'm only getting 2-3 hours of light sleeping per night. \n\nI'm not napping during the day when baby naps because I'm working, pumping and taking care of the house. \n\nMy husband is now voicing that even though he doesn't get up for night feeds that he's not getting enough sleep and is going to bed earlier and is now starting to ask me to take his morning shifts so he can get an extra hour of sleep.\n\nHe can see I'm struggling, having breakdown all the time but the only thing he can say is how I make him feel guilty if he complains about being tired and having to go to work. \n\nHow do/did your household do nights without losing your mind? (And not killing your husband haha) \n\nI know it's going to eventually get better, but anything helps in the short term! \n\n(My husband knows how I feel, I'm very open when it comes to communicating how I feel.

We'd been using baby powder but now I'm basically putting destin on every time. We try to check and change her diaper as often as possible minus at night because she's been sleeping through the night lately.\n\nThe last two days she's had it a little more rough, not widespread but a few really bad spots. Then today one was even bleeding a little. \n\nI'm trying to be so gentle and she's a real trooper, but when she poops I have to be thorough and no matter how gentle I am it still obviously hurts her. It breaks my heart. \n\nAny advice on things I can do? We just moved so things are a little frantic. Basically if it doesn't heal in a few days I plan on going to an urgent care center since getting to the doc on base might be a bit. ",

I don't want to underestimate the amount of joy involved BUT any time I think about motherhood all I can think about is the work and sacrifice. Which, maybe tells me that motherhood isn't for me OR perhaps I am not looking at the whole picture. I have little experience around children or mothers so I don't really know what motherhood really entails/looks like. \n\nAnyway, I am just wondering how the moms on here decided they wanted to be mothers? Something tells me it is more of a natural \"I've always known\" kind of thing but I really have no idea. Any feedback is greatly appreciated :) Thank you! ",

            "selftext": "Disclaimer: I really don't want any negative comments, and I hope nothing I say offends people. These are my opinions/feelings and I'm searching for answers from people who know the mom life best. \n\nSo for years and years, I've known I don't want children. I've avoided children for as long as I can remember. When family members were born, I always begged my mom to not make me go to the hospital or have to hold the baby. I've always been way more of an animal person than a baby person. I don't 'hate' children, it's just that being around them makes me a little uncomfortable.\n\nThat was all fine and dandy to me for a while until I met my SO who absolutely wants kids. He loves kids, grew up helping take care of his sibling/cousins and doesn't see his life without him. We've been together 5 years now and while he knows I'm not completely gung-ho, I'm not sure he understands the extent of my aversion. As we get older and I feel that we will likely get engaged soon, I can't help but constantly think about the expectation to have children in the next few years. The more I evaluate, I realize that I don't necessarily hate the idea of having older children. I think I'd like being a mom to school-aged children, especially when they get into their teens (I was a high school teacher for a little bit, so this makes sense), so maybe I just don't feel warmly to younger children.\n\nAlso, child birth absolutely scares me and I don't imagine myself feeling that immediate bond to a stranger who is now going to absolutely take over my life. I hate the idea of giving up my life as I know it and spending every penny I work for on my child. I don't see myself loving anything as much as I love my dogs. Everyone says these feelings will develop but what if they don't? What if, because I love my SO, I decide to have children and I regret it? I also think about the environment implications of having more children, and is it fair to force them to grow up in a world where the future is a little murky? \n\nDid anyone feel this way but now loves being a mom? Would anyone be willing to admit that they regret their decision (I think it's possible to love your children but regret that you had them at the same time)? I don't know what answers I'm looking for but typing this out was therapeutic nonetheless. I think I want to be a person who wants children and I'm hoping you guys can turn me....",

            "selftext": "Hi there. Would appreciate any and all guidance on this matter.\n\nI'm a single mother of five boys, the oldest being almost 17. My youngest child is 3, turning 4 in November. \n\nAll of my kids were late talkers, including my youngest. He cannot communicate with me as much as other 3 year olds do with their parents. He can recognise Peppa Pig characters and amazingly, he can navigate a phone much better than my father in law! However, he never lets me know when he's soiled his nappy and instead runs upstairs and lies down there. \n\n He is going to nursery next Wednesday and they will not admit any child that is not potty trained. My other kids were potty trained at 2, but this one is very stubborn. Over the past few weeks, when he's wearing nappies/pullups, he doesn't tell me when he's soiled them, and he doesn't want me to change them. \n\nSo today I decided to potty train him and jump straight to underwear. I took out seven pairs of briefs and seven pairs of trousers. And seven times, he peed through his underwear and underwear in the living room / my bedroom, and showed no sign to me that he was either going to pee or he'd already peed. Each time, I got really annoyed and took him to the bathroom and made him sit there, even though he was finished peeing. And he would sit there crying and scratching his arms or knees.\n\nMy other kids want me to just put on his nappies and call it a day. Should I? Am I being too stubborn with him? That last thing I would want is for him to be scared and reluctant to go to the toilet. I've booked an appointment with a health visitor on  Tuesday so that we can discuss this issue and get a note written to the nursery so they can excuse him for not being potty trained.\n\nAny other parents going through or already gone through this issue? How did you solve it? \n\nThank you! ",

In the middle of the night, about 2:30, she felt some mild contractions. After an hour she drew a bath and started to time her contractions. They were all over the place, 2 mins, 4 mins, 3 mins, 5mins. She thought she had plenty of time. Suddenly, she felt like she was going to poop, but soon realized the baby was on it's way. Alone, and in silence, she delivered the baby herself in our bathtub after two quick pushes. I woke up seconds afterwards to her calling for me. I was confused and terrified to see an infant on her chest in the tub. This was NOT our plan! I paged our midwives, and called 911 as was instructed by them. Two ambulances showed up at the same time as our midwife. They determined that mom and baby were perfectly fine, and no hospital visit was needed. The baby is now almost 20 hours old and doing fine. I am still in shock that my wife had an unassisted home birth! She is the strongest person I know, and I just wanted to share this story with some other dads. Also, huge shout out to Midwives everywhere, they offer an amazing service in Ontario, and if it is available where you live, you should definitely look into it!",

They exist, surely, but where are they ??\n\nThen I went out with my baby and needed to breastfeed. I found a spot where there werent any trafic and breastfed and I realized... OMG it is permitted but people are not confortable with it at all !\n\nThe next day we went out again for an ice cream and she started cueing me for feed and cried a little... when she cried, everyone looked at me and I got so uncomfortable I hid in the car to breastfeed while my family went walking without me... and people that saw me breastfeeding in the car were looking at me, which made me uncomfortable. \n\nSo I am thinking... am I supposed to just hide until she doesnt eat so much? Because people are uncomfortable? It kind of suck that our society has sexualized the breast so much when it has a purpose : feeding babies. \n\nIt is legal where I am but people are ... anyway.. what do you do ? Do you still breastfeed in public? Do you mind ? How do you deal with getting out of the house with an exclusively breastfed baby that do not take the bottle yet ?",

I love my daughter, but I feel like I have no identity and I can't do anything I would do to keep developing any other part of myself.\n\nShe wants to eat every hour and a half during the day, and afterwards if I put her anywhere, she fusses and fusses and fusses (scream cries). So I have to be holding her or carrying her (which doesn't always work either). Or if I can get her down and sleeping, she might sleep for ten minutes and then wake up and fuss. Ican't clean, I can't really read, I can't write (writing is my big passion). I can barely even keep myself fed because she starts crying in the time it takes to make toast.\n\nPlus almost every time I feed her, she spits up afterwards. Even if she ate an hour ago (small frequent feedings) or if she's upright. I feel like she's gross and I'm gross and I can't keep us clean and happy at all.\n\nI have no family in the area so by the afternoon, I feel totally trapped and counting down the hours until my husband gets home. What works one day to make her happy doesn't work the next day. I think I understand her cues but then I guess I'm wrong. How does anyone do this and not go crazy?",

She never had children and is sad about it, I told her she could rock my little one as she really likes it and my stepmother hinted she wanted to use my baby wrap to carry her around... I hated the idea of it immediately.. it felt like it would rob me of something far too precious to share... rocking is tolerable but carying my baby against her in my wrap is just way too much for me ... Is my reaction normal ? \n\nI also have some trouble sleeping if she is too far from me... my husband wanted to give me a break yesterday evening so I could sleep alone a while and I ended up not falling asleep until he brought her back in the room with me... \n\nJust to be clear though, I dont mind my husband having her as long as he wants though... Just people outside of us I guess? \n\nMy inlaws will also visit soon for one week and I anticipate it a lot...

When my husband and I go anywhere together, I ride in the back seat with the baby to help entertain her. Whenever my baby cries in the car and can't be consoled my husband tries to bully me into taking her out while we are on the freeway (going 70 mph!!!!). Not only do I believe it is VERY illegal but I can't imagine feeling safe enough to take an infant out of their seat when at any moment we could be hit and they could be ejected from my hands and the car and not survive.\n\nHe doesn't handle stress of any kind and immediately becomes a jerk and calls me names, puts me down and tries to bully me in to taking them out. \n\nI know the laws about a child being in the appropriate seats, but I am curious if anyone knows the laws (USA) about a child not being restrained while the car is moving.  \n\nI'm hoping someone else out there has dealt with something similar and can provide a little advice.

Our daughter is 3.\n\nFor nine years I have gotten up with the kids and put the kids to bed. I drop the kids off at school/sitters and pick them up. I make them dinner, I clean up after them, I take them to their extra curriculars, I make all their appointments. Not to mention that I do 75% of the house work. All while I work part time as well.\n\nMy husband goes to bed around 3am so he only gets up with a few hours in between to shower and stuff. Weekends? Well he's still on his schedule so he still sleeps until 11 (I get up with the kids and still also put them to bed).\n\nYesterday I had a breakdown because a project I was working on fell through. Why? Because I get hardly any kid-free time. I got mad. He got mad that I was mad. It's like I'm not allowed to dislike the situation because he's \"bringing home the bacon.\" But am I about to get a full time job with a schedule like that? Hell no. I'm stressed enough.\n\nI know it's not entirely his choice. I do try and empathise; I'm grateful for him. He's a good father. But I am really frustrated. I just needed to vent. I don't feel like I can talk to anyone about this. ",

(choosing career over being with them all the time) Does this feeling go away as your kids get older and you can interact with them more? I'd even consider working hard for a long time now and staying home when they're entering adolescence since that's sometimes a hard time in life and it pays to have a loving parent to talk to after school.

            "selftext": "I just had a baby boy named Ethan 5 days ago today. Reposted from two chromosomes sub someone recommended I post here.\n\nSo a little background. I had a planned pregnancy, average working class person with a working class boyfriend who is a lot older than me. He has other child who are grown up who he helped raise and had kids young since in his culture during that time it was the thing to do. He loves his kids and loves this baby too. I am so lucky, while I have been crying and in pain he has been loving the baby and holding the baby while working and not once has lost patience with us. We wanted a baby more than anything and enjoyed my pregnancy though I did have a traumatic childhood also (mom was great doesn't even drink a beer, had a traumatic childhood also. dad loves me but...he also had a terrible childhood full of abuse and poverty and was a drug addict and alcoholic) so it's a repeating pattern in my family that hasn't really been broken by any of us and I have a huge family. I hope to fix myself so that my child doesn't have to grow up the way his father, me, and my parents did (I also never touch drugs or alcohol either does his dad)\n\nSo to the story. I turned 41 weeks last Friday and woke up having contractions. SO was looking at me and decided he was gonna stay home anyways because he felt like this was it. We had a false alarm a few weeks ago and he stayed with me all night in the hospital. So he goes to see his mami and sister quick because I wanted to go to Walmart with my friend and walk the baby out. I called the clinic and they had me come in and timed my contractions 2-5 minutes but my BP was 157/98. It went down 150/98 so they told me to go to labor and delivery ASAP. I was in labor 3cm 100% effaced 0 station baby. I got there and called SO with a few demands and he got all the stuff together and packed cheese (yes cheese? lol he passed out cheese to my parents and best friend). We got there everything was peaceful and my BP went down to 130s/70s and continued to normal. The nurse came in and put the iv and said the doc wanted to start pitocin since I was still 3cm after a few days.\n\nSo after I started pitocin they said I have to have an epidural because my labor would be very hard. They were going to turn the pitocin all the way up. I said no. They came in with an iv pain med saying it would make me sick but they zofran before it happens. I'm scared of being sick. They also said it would hurt my baby more than the epidural. So I decided to go with the epidural. My boyfriend was scared because it was a needle in my back and my parents and friend say that he paced back and forth to the door and waiting room. So anyways I was feeling okay then slowly feeling one side. They got more meds and I still felt it but they couldn't do much more. Around 4am I felt so much pain. I called out for my bf who was in the couch and the nurse came in and told me to go to sleep. I couldnt with the pain and thought I just wasn't managing. By the time I was hysterical they checked me at 10 cm but baby had flipped Sunny side up and went back up the birth canal. They had me push for an hour and he wasn't coming down. They said I needed a c section and asked who was coming to be with me and my bf scrubbed up. I was still screaming because I can't remember the pain but I remember I was in so much nothing made me feel better. They rolled me in screaming and I was just looking at the ceiling and started to go numb. They did test cuts to see if I could feel the saddle block working. On the right side I realized I could and told them. They kept putting meds in and I could still feel. I looked at my boyfriend and said I was okay and he looked scared. Last thing I remember.\n\nMy boyfriend had said at that time I started screaming as they cut me and they told him to get out and they put me under immediately. My boyfriend was brought our baby and he cooed and loved and my parents say hoarded the baby. He is still hoarding baby.\n\nI woke up to going down the hallway and my boyfriend out my baby to me and told me to kiss our baby. I was crying apparently and reaching for him. In recovery I was crying in between waking up because I wanted my baby.  \n\n\nPost partum had a different feel then labor and delivery and the ob. They weren't as nice. They were very inconvenienced by helpless me and would ignore me calling them. So I would send my boyfriend out. I just figured there was other moms that were sick or babies that were sick that needed them more. I had my baby at 6am so at 7pm I finally got my Cath removed. She told me after to tell her when I needed to pee. My boyfriend cared for our baby and me too. He brought me food once I was able to have it and everything else.\n\nSo the 2nd incident I called the nurse and told her I needed to pee. She came in and checked my vitals and told me she would be right back to help me she had another patient. So I  waited and waited. An hour later I called. The receptionist was snooty. I called 45 minutes later saying could my boyfriend just help me, she said no. 15 minutes later I send him out to the the nurse. She cane back and i told her I may pee myself. She cheerly said \"it's okay if you pee yourself\". After that my boyfriend helped me up and to the bathroom. \n\n3rd thing was later on that night I woke up feeling sick with fever. I called and told the nurse. She said okay someone would be in. Half hour later I had my boyfriend get the baby thermometer out of my bag. 100.6. I called and said I had a fever. She was snooty saying she would send someone. Half hour later I started getting scared I had an infection and told my boyfriend I didn't wanna die there. He went and got the nurse again. She came in and it was 101.6. things got serious other nurses came in and said I needed tylenol and the Dr ordered antibiotics 3 kinds, and then blood work. About 5 draws in one arm Because the iv was in the other. My fever stayed the whole night.\n\nThe morning nurses came in and asked if I walkiled yet. I said the bathroom. She got rude and asked why. I said I wasn't allowed. The other nurse told her that i had only had 2 tylenol to treat my pain and then asked if innew about the other pain relief options. The night nurses had only told me tylenol for pain. She asked if I showered and I told her no I wasn't allowed yet. Then asked about the fever. I told her about the fever and the almost peeing myself. The nurse told me I had the fever because I was forced to stay in bed and not shower or move for 24 hours. I had asked night nurse to walk because I didn't want a clot and she said that's what compression socks were for. Later that day when I had my shower the nurse had discovered the socks cut into my skin but I wasn't allowed to remove them during the night. So anyways the nurse had told the supervisor the way I was treated and it was okay kind of. I did realize the 2 days I was there I didn't get my wound cleaned at all. My I realized that as soon as they told me to clean 4 times a day.\n\nSo I didn't realize how sad I was until a few hours before I was released. I started crying uncontrollably like mental breakdown cry. I told my boyfriend I loved our baby and his little face was so cute. But I couldn't understand how he was mine because I didn't remember having him. Then when I was in bed helpless to soothe him and watch my boyfriend do it I was unconsolable and kept saying I'm sorry I ruined your life you wont ever sleep again. He's order and I had a vision of basically killing him because of our baby waking him up. I was so sad. It's been 5 days and I feel like a failure. I regret my baby but I love him and his little squishy face. I keep crying as soon as my boyfriend gets home. Idk what to do. I know this may be post partum but it may also be because of my hospital experience. I also say the supervisor gave me a $16 be quiet gift card for the care I received. Also my boyfriend loves the baby and never gave me a thought he didn't want the baby.\n\nTL;DR: hard labor, cut into me too fast, nurse left me needing to pee after Cath for over an hour, spiked a fever and was ignored, I feel like a bad mom and like I ruined my boyfriends life. I can't connect with my baby and I don't feel like he's mine.",

            "selftext": "TL;DR:daughters lifelong friend now presents male, they're upset we're applying house rules that forbid opposite sex friends in bedrooms. Looking for any advice or stories of experiences like this?\nHere's the back story:\nI grew up with this kid's mom. We were best friends for nearly 20 years, until she developed a nasty drug habit. Her crazy behavior ultimately culminated in her making false reports to child services, in an attempt to \"get back at me\". Our friendship, needless to say, did not survive after that. Prior to that time, we'd been quite close. We both have daughters, they're about a year apart in age, and until my daughter was 9, they were together often. Our girls have always been very close, but after the blowout with my former friend, we didn't see either of them for several years.\n\nFlash forward about 3 years. A letter is dropped at the house. The kid wants to reconnect. She's living with dad's parents now. Mom's not in the picture. Okay, we say, come on by! You're always welcome. She shows up, we have a great time, her and my daughter hang out, all is good. We don't hear from her again until about 6mos later. I get a text saying there's something she'd like to talk about, has nothing to do with her mom, but it's important and \"self-related\". Okaaay. Come on by, we say. Time she's to arrive comes and goes, and I get another text - basically, \"hey, I identify as male now, I didn't know how to tell you. Should I still come?\"\n\nWoah. Okay, my 12yo is expecting her childhood girl friend - how do I explain this? Talk to my husband. What we come up with is: not my kid, not my business. If this is what makes her happy? I can swap a name and a pronoun. Still the same kid, just a different haircut, as far as this concerns us. So we talk to our daughter. Explain that this is evidently what makes her friend happy, and since it has no bearing on our lives, the only \"right\" thing to do, in our opinion, is simply accept the changes, and be happy for her friend that they've found something that gives them some peace. Awesome. So I respond to the text \"is there a name change we need to know? Preferred pronouns? And of *course you should still come. Can't promise we'll get it right all the time, but we'll definitely try, if you're cool being patient while we adjust!\"\n\nSo we play it out, see what happens. Kiddo shows up, and we were right, same kid, different haircut. Here's where my daughter is mad at me - we mentioned, after her friend had left, that since he's a boy now, he'll have to follow boy rules - no boys in girl bedrooms. Just like no girls in boy bedrooms. Literally nothing else changes. I'm concerned that her friend will take this change personally, but my feeling is that if he'd like to be treated like a male, the best and only thing I can do is treat him like a boy all the way, and sorry, but no you won't be allowed in her bedroom, alone, behind closed doors. It has nothing to do with anything else but fairness. Idk what I'm doing here!",

I just wanted to vent a little bit and see if I'm not the only one going through some weird body changes. 1 year after having baby and I am struggling with some issues and not just the typical weight gain and saggy boobs, though I have those too. \n\nSince having a kid I have developed an allergy to metal. Which I discovered when I put in my earrings again after a while and my ears bled and burned. Only surgical steel for me now it seems.\n\nAnd more recently I've become lactose intolerant! Or rather I've finally admitted it to myself and got a DR verification that yeah, maybe it's not normal to poop your guts out after an ice cream cone. \n\nI won't go into more detail unless pressed, but that's the gist of it. Am I the only one? Anybody else have their body go a little crazy after the baby?",

My SO is about to graduate with his bachelors degree. He's been taking 20 credits this term so he could graduate sooner. Because of this I only get to see him on the weekends. But this weekend was supposed to be really busy as he got ready for finals. I told him to focus on school and that I would see him when he graduated. \n\nHe surprised me yesterday by driving two hours to see us. Then this morning he got up at 5:30 with our baby and let me sleep until 9 when he needed to leave to get back to school. \n\nHe ran the dishwasher and took out the trash before he left. \n\nLay it on me, moms.

Last night he asked his friend about his honest opinion about what he thinks. He said he had to pry it out of him but basically that his wife (my close friend) said that she was surprised that when she watched my son that he would flop around when he was mad and that she thought I could be doing more to discipline him and that she was surprised he acts like that. \nI was honestly a bit hurt by that comment mainly because I wish she could have spoken to me about it. \nAlso I feel when our kids are playing together  my son is respectful with sharing toys and how he acts. It seems like the children play well together. Of course there are normal behaviors like my son will be upset if he sees food and can\u2019t have it or her daughter will be possessive over her toys - but he is normally a very docile child (heard this from multiple people).  When he\u2019s stressed out when I leave him somewhere he does start to freak out a bit. I don\u2019t really know what I can even do about this and feel frustrated about the whole thing. I don\u2019t want to be one of those parents who don\u2019t accept any advice but at the same time I feel like I need to make sure that the advice I take is coming from the right place? I do plan on making sure I follow through every time he tries to hit and let him know it\u2019s not acceptable. I guess I just needed to vent. ",

My husband and I have an opportunity to take a vacation without our baby for up to five days. \n\nFor the most part, I'm ok with an occasional night out and having a babysitter. So far, we have only had two overnight babysitting times, partly because of scheduling/availability/drama. My husband and I used to go on spur of the moment trips fairly often, but now things have to be more scheduled and I'm finding it hard to leave our daughter. Going on a vacation without her feels like when she started at daycare and I would cry everyday for two weeks straight. I was happy when my husband started doing the drop offs because I didn't have to anymore. It's still hard when I actually walk out of the house (when she's babysat at home) even though I have a wonderful time and need to go out. \n\nMy husband misses the trips that we would take and spending time with me. Even when we have a babysitter, our time is fairly limited. He's chafing at the limitations, is cooped up, and feels that our daughter will be perfectly fine without us. The person who actually babysits aside, he thinks all of her needs will be perfectly taken care of and if they're not, we should address it after the fact. He seems to have no qualms at all about spending a few to several days away from our baby. He's excited about the possible trip and while I do want to go and spend time with him and our friends who will be there, too, I can't help but dread leaving my baby and cry at the thought.\n\nAm I being too clingy? I've talked with other mother's and they don't seem mind being away from their kids.",

            "selftext": "So my ex husband moved to Phoenix and I'm in Dallas. He used to love 5 hours away so we would just drive 2 and half hours to meet. He moved about 2 months ago and this summer our 11 year old will be flying, alone, to him. I am freaking out. Neither of us have been on a plane. She's told me she isn't scared and she's excited to go. My ex told me there is going to be a flight attendant with her at all times, he paid more for that he says, she will board first and last. I can't leave til her plane leaves and she won't be handed off without my ex or his wife presenting their id. Everything sounds good and in order but my anxiety is thru the roof. I hate hate hate the thought of her afraid and alone on a plane. My mom and fiance said the worst part is take off and I hate knowing I won't be there to hold her hand. I'm also afraid of some freak accident happening, although I know it's safer up there than in a car. Some days thinking about it I want to cry, ok I know I'm being to dramatic but I'm being truthful.\n\n\nHave any of y'all sent a kiddo alone? Any advice or happy stories will be nice.",

So I jokingly ask, \"What are you getting me?\" He looks at me &amp; replies \"a hug\" I honestly was a bit shocked! But laughed it off &amp; looked at my 8 month old &amp; said, \"I pushed you out naturally, for a hug dude\" To which the S.O says \"It's HIS job to get you something\".  I wasn't really hurt, but more surprised at his lack of effort &amp; how serious he was. His mother &amp; I get along well, so there's no issue there!

My MIL is upset because I already told her we\u2019re not renting out a large hall or an outdoor pavilion because I want to do something smaller that little one would actually enjoy.  Not to mention, I\u2019m tired of stressing and working every birthday party serving everyone when my little one doesn\u2019t even enjoy it.  See, the in laws feel you have to invite everyone (except my family doesn\u2019t feel this way so it ends up just being my siblings and parents and then every aunt, uncle, second cousin, great aunt, etc. on the in law side) which is 75% people 50-75 years old.  It\u2019s hard to plan fun parties for kids this little when I have to cater to the elderly family.  Add to that I have to feed all of them which is generally 30-50 people.  And not just snacks, a meal with coffee after.  Am I in the wrong?  Should I suck it up and shell out another $300-$500 for a party?  Am I the only one who finds this constant game of one upping each birthday party exhausting and totally worthless?",

            "selftext": "\nNot sure if this is the right place to post this, but I wasn\u2019t confident that the majority of commenters on /r/relationships would be helpful.\n\nI've been full-time nannying my friends' 1-yr old son since last November. The mom had extreme difficulty conceiving and it was a long, upsetting and expensive process. Her husband was ambivalent about having kids, and it was difficult to get him to be supportive of her throughout that process. I\u2019ve heard rumors that if they didn\u2019t have this kid that she was going to leave him. The birth was difficult and the baby was 4 weeks premature, so he has some developmental delays, but he's a happy and healthy kid. \n\nSince I've been nannying for them, I've been told explicitly by the father that he is not interested in raising his son, that maybe when he's older, he'll be more interesting to him, he tells his son \"I'm so happy to see you...NOT! I just have to say that\" and a bunch of other shocking and upsetting things. He doesn\u2019t read to him, or feed him, or notice him, unless he absolutely has to or feels like he needs to keep up appearances. Both parents and I had a group communication channel which he has left because he \u201cdoesn\u2019t like answering questions\u201d and he became so hostile to me every time I asked or mentioned his son, that I became hesitant to talk to him about anything baby related. I didn\u2019t allow him to intimidate me with his anger and confronted him about it, and he apologized and said that his wife is \u201cused to it\u201d but I haven\u2019t been privy to it until I started nannying and that\u2019s no excuse and he\u2019s sorry. I can\u2019t imagine what she endures in private.\n\nThe mom is basically a single mother, which would be difficult enough, but out of resentment, the father deliberately tries to undermine her (and my) efforts to nurture him and keep him safe. Yesterday he unplugged the crib camera so the mom couldn\u2019t see that he left the baby in there all morning, and said that the baby unplugged it (impossible). The baby also started crawling forward this week, and both me and the mom want to childproof the play space (put gates up, remove or gate a glass coffee table) and he\u2019s fighting her on it/lying to me about planning to do it. He also told me earlier this week that he\u2019s already banged his head on it SEVERAL TIMES, which means he\u2019s watching him crawl over to it and not stopping him. \n\nBefore anyone says \u201cshe should leave/divorce him,\u201d I want to make it clear that before the kid, they went to counseling and almost split up, and didn\u2019t. I really truly doubt that she will leave him, so I\u2019m trying to come up with a more moderate way of supporting/empowering her and ensuring that the dad doesn\u2019t undermine the safety/development of his son. \n\nI also get the impression from the other moms in our circle that the dad\u2019s ambivalence and negligence, while super obnoxious, isn\u2019t exactly uncommon. How concerned should I be? He\u2019s clearly emotionally abusing his wife, but by most standards, between the mom\u2019s and my care, the baby is fine. If this were my partner I would be beside myself, but I would also never have a child with someone who was so blatantly and admittedly immature and disinterested. Any advice?\n\ntl;dr I\u2019m a nanny for a baby with a negligent, immature, needy father and his resigned, exhausted and depressed wife. Hard to witness, even harder to help.",

We are traveling to the wedding and feel okay about the flight etc... Bride and groom are totally cool with him at the wedding and my family will be able to help my husband and I.  My MIL lives in the same city as the wedding and has offered to baby-sit him so we can enjoy the wedding. I'd love to take her up on this offer.  However, I'm planning to breast-feed and don't know if I can really be away from him at all during this time. I don't know how good I'll be at pumping either. And I'm not opposed to formula, but I was sorta hoping to breast feed at least throughout my entire maternity leave (3 months). \n\n\nMoms- what do you think? Will I be able to leave my baby at all? Would it be possible to bring him for a little while (to breast feed and get some pictures in) and then we'll take him to the hotel (10-15 mins) away where Grandma will watch him in our room until we return 3-4 hours later?

            "selftext": "Dear Mothers! I need your opinion on one topic. \n\nI am getting married in three weeks. \nThe setting: We are in Europe. The wedding will be in a place with no public transport available, we are booking a bus for all the guests and it is one hour ride. It is 79 km from the original destinations and taxis are super expensive. Public transport is not an option.\nThe bus picks up the guests at 11.30 AM and brings them back at around midnight or later. So the whole thing is around 13 hours and with no way to escape.\n\nWe planned an entirely adult wedding: music, unlimited supply of wine and beer, trivia games etc. etc. Nothing, nada, nichts is there for children. \n\nSo today we were skyping with my future in-laws and they were  like: \"Oh, X and Y(13 months old) are coming too. Booked tickets from a US city\". The original plan and confirmations we got were that they are not coming. They just changed their mind and never told us. \n\nSo I have zero experience with children. Is it even realistic that a toddler (who took a 14 hour flight) feels ok next day at a wedding that lasts so long? There might be a changing room, no clue about it. There is no place for the child to take a nap. The wedding is most likely inside as it will be cold. The restaurant is not huge and it will be loud. There is no room for any privacy unless they will lock themselves up in a restroom. Outside might be not an option as it is still cold here. We will also have music there and loud guests.  Obviously, no other children will be there. \n\nCan a toddler take a nap when it is so loud? Can it eat normal food from her mother's plate or do I need to do some special food arrangements with the restaurant? I am horrified, I see an exhausted, non-stop crying child, frustrated guests and upset parents. I need tips on what we could do to stick to the adult wedding but make the stay for the child, parents and guests comfortable. ",

I myself did not get a single vaccination until I was pregnant and my midwife suggested a few to get. \n\nNow I have a baby, he's beautiful and perfect, and getting vaccinated tomorrow.  And because I dragged my feet he's delayed and will actually have to get several.  I know I'm being irrational but I am absolutely terrified.   \n\nIt has been hammered into me since birth that vaccines kill and maim.  My mother told me \"the light would go out of his eyes\".  She told me he might suddenly become delayed, get new allergies, become severely disabled.  Everything bad.  I'm trying to be brave and do the right thing but I keep crying.  By family has sent me every article about vaccine injury they can find.  But my husband is determined and I understand he needs them.  \n\nI rely heavily on my \"mom instinct\" but right now it's being drowned out by fear instilled by decades of brain-washing.  \n\nSo please, tell me happy stories about how your child is perfect and intelligent and vaccinated.  If you have any resources to reassure me (even though I've already read a lot about it from every angle) I'll take it.  Statistics still scare me because even in 1/1000 chance that 1 could be my baby. \n\n",

We took a flight with my son same time last year when he was about 1.5 years old but never before then so first time flying with an infant and also first time flying with 2 kids. Looking for any tips ideas for the flight but also need advice for when we get to the hotel like what we would need for example i realized last night i am going to need a baby bath. We are flying domestic so i can have an amazon order shipped directly to the hotel and have it waiting when we get there. Thanks in advance!",

I\u2019m pregnant my first time and was wondering...how soon can you travel (baby or no baby) after giving birth?\n\nI\u2019m hoping to travel since my sister\u2019s destination wedding is about eight months away and my due date is two weeks before:\n\nIt\u2019s a VERY small intimate destination wedding and a wedding has always been something that\u2019s insanely important to her. She\u2019s always been obsessed with weddings and I could tell she was a bit disappointed when I didn\u2019t have a wedding but threw a local, low key anniversary party instead. And my family and I have been waiting for it to happen for nearly a decade so it\u2019s very exciting for it to finally happen. She\u2019s already gotten party planners doing everything and sent the Save the Dates just this week. She\u2019s known about my pregnancy the day I found out last year but I\u2019ve not felt ok asking her to change the date since it\u2019s really her big day.\n\nMy family is quite close knit and have already expressed dismay that her only sibling won\u2019t be there. A few cousins even told me it\u2019d be unthinkable to not have their only sibling at their weddings. She\u2019s encouraging me to fly anyway and my in-laws say it\u2019s possible, albeit unlikely I\u2019ll want to. My own parents don\u2019t like the idea at all. I\u2019m also worried how gross I\u2019ll feel and the last thing I\u2019ll want to do is go to a fancy wedding...but this is my first pregnancy and I just don\u2019t know. I would love any words of advice on women who have gone through this!",

My daughter is 18 months and she is into everything... which is really affecting my ability to do the basic self-care in the morning like washing my face, brushing my teeth, god forbid showering or blow drying my hair. The last time I took a shower with her locked in the bathroom with me, she ignored the box of toys we keep in the bathroom and instead, broke into the drawer where I keep my tampons (there was a drawer lock on it but apparently she has super-toddler strength?) and threw tampons all over the bathroom before screaming at me and banging on the glass shower door. Now, mommas, I try to be zen about it and use soft voice to say \u201cI\u2019m almost done and I\u2019ll be just a minute\u201d and I sing songs and recite books, but y\u2019all I AM TIRED AND I JUST WANT TO SHOWER. So here is my question \u2014 what works/worked for you at this age? Did you get up early before your kid? Did you only shower when your SO could watch them? (This is harder for me since my SO travels a lot and is often on last-minute conference calls.) Did you toddler proof-the bathroom and just let them scream? I\u2019ve honestly thought about buying a second set of all of my toiletries to have downstairs so I can use them in the kitchen while she eats breakfast. I\u2019m just so tired of this and I would so appreciate some new strategies to try (I\u2019m sure a lot of them are obvious but I\u2019m mom-stupid after the holidays.)",

In the past 6 months we have had 10 various DR's visits regarding our 6 month old's hearing loss issues and now moving forward into more visits with hearing aid fittings.   \nThat stress alone is hard, but she transferred to a new school at the end of her recent maternity leave for her teaching position and that has added a longer commute and all the stress of trying to learn a new school and meeting/exceeding administration and parent expectations for her position.  Her new position is more rewarding, but she pays for it in added stress and she doesn't have as much planning as she used to.  She can't pump as much as she did with our first son, and it really makes her feel like she is dropping the ball.  \nShe also has a second job that is normally rewarding that keeps her out 2 nights a week and can add several weekend requirements and a lot of extra work in December.  With all of her current stress she is thinking about quitting the second job, but she is worried that this feeling is only temporary and she would really regret it long term. \nWe also have added stress with her mother keeping the boys for a couple days a week.  It does help us financially and she is great with the boys, but we have to pat her ego and deal with her throwing major and unwarranted fits on a weekly basis. We have talked about moving them to full time day care, but it would only make the relationship worse with her and her mother and the kids would really take a hit.  \nAll of that being said, she is having a hard time balancing it all.  I am there to help with the kids and house stuff, but she finds that she is just failing at a lot of small tasks that she normally handles.  This time of year is extremely hard on her, and I am thinking that if we can get through the next couple of weeks, she will have some time off and her next semester will be easier and her stress and anxiety will diminish.  \nShe did have added anxiety and depression during her pregnancy, that she didn't have during her first pregnancy.  She took some safe antidepressants and it helped a bit with the anxiety, but it made her feel foggy and tired.  The added tired feeling wasn't that big of a deal because she was already tired from being pregnant.  Shortly after the baby was born her hormones started to adjust and she started feeling a lot better and stopped taking it.  She feels a little bit like she did during pregnancy, but it's not as debilitating.  She doesn't want to take the medication now because she feels like it would be counter productive because the added fatigue of the meds would just limit her even more.\nI wish we had enough money so only one of us had to work, but it's just not an option.  \nI love my wife and I do everything I can. I can feel all the stress as well and it hurts me knowing how defeated she feels. She asks that if you have any ideas for dealing with fatigue and stress, to please let us know.  Does it get easier?   Thanks for any advice/thoughts.",

We're in Minnesota so it's cold so I always have pants on him, he rubs over it and I keep catching him and stopping it. I've been giving him baths only every 3 days due to it being so dry here. \n\nIm at a loss right now what to due cus the advice I got from my parents were to let him run around naked but he'll just scratch at it and there's already 2 open bleeding cracks and I don't want to get it any worse. If this isn't the right sub I'm sorry, does any one have advice or tried or true ways to get rid of it I hate seeing my child in pain. ",

            "selftext": "So, I'm a terrible mom, apparently.\n\nI didn't opt for those adorable newborn photos everyone gets.  I didn't get family portraits.  I didn't even get maternity photos.\n\nI just never thought about it. \n\nWell, turns out this is just HORRIBLE and I've missed SO much by not calling my nearest baby photographer ASAP, even though I take pictures and post them up every day and have been doing so since she was born.  But no... Those photos won't do.  You HAVE to get professional ones! (All according to friends and family and other moms, apparently).\n\nSo, for my little girl's 6 month \"birthday\", I decided to call around.  I wanted something special.  Something fantasy-based because I'm a nerd who's obsessed with D&amp;D and Renn Fest.  I found the PERFECT lady.  Offering \"fairy\" photos.  I call her, talk to her, she offers me some samples.  Cute, but really they were just regular photos with some sparkley bits put in photoshop.  Whatever... I'm supposed to get professional pics so, dammit... I'm doing it.\n\nUntil she told me the price.\n\nFor her \"mini session\" (15 minutes of shooting time and 5 final photos), she wanted $450.  Uh... Excuse me?  I get it, you have to pay the bills, you have to pay for all that gear.  Being a photographer is expensive... But... Just... What?\n\nI couldn't do it.  I called many others in the area and the rates were all around the same price.  WHAT THE HECK?!  When did this get so expensive?  My 12 year old's 1 year photoshoot lasted all day and cost me around $200 and ended up beautiful.  But $450 for 15 minutes?!  I want to ask is this normal, but, you guys... I called 14. Different. Photographers.  It was all the same price. Omg.\n\nEither way, in the end... I took my little girl to a park, snapped some pictures with my phone and sat down and watched 9 billion YouTube videos about photo editing and did it all myself.  I'll put all the money I saved in her savings account and maybe keep $5 for myself for a box of wine.\n\n\nI'm not 100% on the child tax... But here's the finished product: \nhttps://imgur.com/3KBHf8a\n\nI feel like I can send these to people confidently and not have them harp me, anymore, about getting a professional. \n",

            "selftext": "first, I'd like to say that I've been suffering from postpartum depression, and I'm having an increasingly difficult time getting out and talking to anyone. I've just started counseling (finally).\n\nI've been having a really, really hard time joining groups- online Facebook groups seem okay at first, but then I have to leave because I can't handle the judgement for whatever I'm doing. I had to leave a postpartum mental health support group on Facebook because one admin was SO ANNOYING. The only way to get her to leave me alone was to leave. It sucks because everyone else was so supportive.\n\nBut it's not just Facebook groups, it's local groups too. Most of them seem really slow, if not dead. They only meet like once a month, or they meet far away. A lot of them center around exercise (that I can't do because reasons), or \"crunchy\" stuff (I tried all of it and absolutely none of it worked out other than breastfeeding). Or they're religious, and I'm an atheist. There's a few groups for military women/spouses, but I'm not military and nobody in my family currently is.\n\nIt's hard to get out and meet people, so hard that I've become really jaded by the \"find mom friends\" advice I've gotten. Like, I'm now convinced it's the worst advice anyone could get, and it's definitely the worst advice I've gotten. The online groups are, for the most part, way better than anyone in real life. Has anyone else had this experience? Or is my ppd making me crazy and triggering my social anxiety?",

The thing that struck me about daddit was that most of the content consisted of images of kodak moments. It was mostly along the lines of \"my kid just did something cool or funny so here's a picture of it\". There is very little discussion there compared to mommit. I would wager that it's mostly the mom who is taking care of the kids while the dad works. I get that is what usually happens in most societies, but I wonder if it's right that it's always the mom who has to stay home and look after the kids and never the dad.

            "selftext": "Like the title says, I think I made a mistake when choosing my baby's name. My s/o and I battled for a very long time on names before we finally decided on the name Roman for our little boy. Near the end of my pregnancy I started getting cold feet on the name, but pushed aside my feelings thinking that he would come out and the name would work for him despite my fears of it not fitting. Boy, was I wrong. \n\nHe came out and I instantly knew in my gut that we had chosen the wrong name. Still, that was the only name we could agree on for months so I went with it. Now he's almost 4 weeks old and I absolutely HATE it. My s/o says he'll \"earn it\" or \"grow into it\" and I just don't think so. When we chose the name we thought we were going to have a dark haired baby with a dark complexion. Instead we've got this adorable blonde-haired blue-eyed anomaly. I know his features could still change, but i don't think I'll ever be happy with his name. \n\nSeveral people have told me that they like the name, but it doesn't fit him. It hurts my heart every single day that I don't want to say my baby's name out loud and I normally just end up calling him a funny nickname when referring to him. I want to be able to snuggle him and when he cries be able to say \"it's okay, baby's name. Mama's here.\"  It just tastes weird coming out. I almost want to cry typing this. \n\nWhat I'm asking is basically, are there any other mamas out there that have had a similar situation? What did you do about it? Will I ever get used to it? I'm also looking for suggestions on names. I'm in love with the name Liam for him, but his dad hates that, and we're back at square one where we can't agree on anything. I'd like to change it as soon as possible if that's the route we decide to take. I'm adding a couple pictures of the little nugget as well and asking for suggestions from you ladies on names you think might fit. Thanks! \n\n\n[newborn photos](https://imgur.com/gallery/RLI1A)\n",

When we first started there, they asked for a list of food restrictions. As she was under a year, we listed that salt and sugar be avoided as much as possible and stated that we are happy to send in homemade substitutes when necessary. They assured us that they never include sugar or salt in the food that they provide. We're not completely opposed to a tiny bit of salt or sugar, but also don't want her eating junk as a baby. Recently, we have noticed that they have started serving her more and more food with excess amounts of sugar. Today they told me that they gave her the canned fruit salad that is in the sugar syrup. Before that, they have given her cookies (not the baby kind) and flavoured yogurt. Let me say that I am not completely anti-sugar and will happily let her have some treats once she is a bit older, but I feel like this is unnecessary for an infant. Just wanted to get other moms opinions on this and see if I'm being irrational. ",

She has been reading up on a lot of books to get ready, but is still pretty nervous about the actual giving birth process.\n\nI was hoping I could do something for her, or get something for her to make that process as painless (but still memorable in a good way) as possible.\n\nBeing a guy myself and quite inexperienced, I am turning to you all for your advice. What would you have like to have been told or what would you like to have had going into your first time giving birth? \n\nThank you!\n\nedit:\nDidn't receive any responses on /r/askreddit, so I'm trying a more specific subreddit. Would really appreciate any advice or suggestion!\n\nsecond edit:\nThank you all so much for each and every post. I'm a bit shocked that it sounds like it hurts a lot more than people make it sound, because honestly it sounds like a lot of people keep telling her it won't be as 'bad' as people say, so it seems like the opposite is kind of true. Learning a lot about small things like padcicles and all the little extras you can do to make things more comfortable. \n\nI will take the time over the coming days to respond to everyones' thoughtful advice and comments, so apologies if you don't get a response right away! I've been checking them on the comments in my spare time on my phone, and the overwhelming number of comments and replies I've received so far is really wonderful. Thank you all so much!\n",

On top of that, various members of our family suffer from dust, pollen and dander allergies (plus we have a cat).  Lately our old Oreck vacuum has been performing below par, which is quite frustrating for my wife. She's expressed several times that she wants a better one. Her birthday is in two weeks and I would like to buy her a very high end vacuum. I found a [vacuum recommendation quiz](http://hazoog.com/quiz/best-vacuum-cleaner-amazon-vacuum-cleaners/), which suggested I buy the \"Dyson Cinetic Big Ball Animal Plus Allergy\". Is it in poor taste to give this as a gift? I'll also be giving her a certificate for a spa day. Please advise, as I am often off the mark on these things.\n\n**TLDR: Should I give my wife a fancy vacuum for her birthday? I'm also giving her a spa day certificate.**",

            "selftext": "Hello! Thanks to all your questions and suggestions that I do an AMA, here I am to answer all your questions about language and reading development, starting from the first ba-ba-ma's to learning multiple languages! \n\nI'm half way through my doctoral work, studying the relationship between the written word and how it directly influences certain mental states in people, like anger, empathy, memory retention, etc. Starting from 6 months in utero, the human fetus can hear language as distinct sounds and begins to learn their parent's accents! Their first babbles are already influenced by the dominant language heard around them. And they understand words, long before they can speak them! So how do you know your baby is on track? When should you be worried or push for evaluation? What kind of words are most useful to teach first? When are their brains ready for certain ideas, like feelings and emotions? \n\nI know for myself, my research helped me as a parent, to not stress about some things, to facilitate my children's verbal and reading development, and to make my life waaay easier! So if you have any questions about how the brain actually works when it's learning to talk and read, what's a normal developmental phase for your child, and if your kid is ever going to start saying something comprehensible, ask away! \n\nPlease post your questions and I'll be live from 1 - 3 p.m. CST to chat and answer! I'm so happy to have a chance to give back to this special community. This place was my happy place during my first pregnancy and when I was figuring out what the heck to do with my baby now that she was born! Thank you for that!\n\nEdit: Okay, I spent WAY more time on this than I intended - kudos to my lovely husband who took the kids for the afternoon! Thank you all for your questions, I really enjoyed this. Feel free to keep posting questions, I'll check back every once in a while for a few days and try to get to you all. You're all awesome mothers who clearly  love your children and care for them deeply! They are lucky to have you as their mothers!",

I try to get a break from the constant crying but my husband has such a short fuse, and the moment she begins crying he starts freaking out and yelling so I have to take her. \n\nI get no break, no support, and all this pressure is on me to be the patient one and calm her down. Honestly, I don't know what to do anymore. It's making me hate my life and the worst feeling in the world is feeling resentment towards a little human when it's not even her fault. Please help me. \n\nEdit: I truly appreciate everyone's advice and comforting words! I told my husband that he needs to get anger management and he blew it out of proportion and stormed out on me. Everyone's input will definitely help me to figure out how to do this on my own. So thank you ",

            "selftext": "I started going to my chiropractor's office when I was about 28 weeks pregnant.  I stopped for six weeks after I had my son and just recently started going back.  There are 3 doctors at this practice, Dr. O (who I'm pretty sure is the main doctor even though he's practically never there), Dr. P, and Dr. W.  During my pregnancy, I saw Dr. P about 90% of the time and would see Dr. W when he was out of the office.  When I went back, they scheduled me with Dr. W.\n\nWhen I saw her on Tuesday, she asked how my baby was doing.  I said he was fine, but he had just gotten his two month shots that morning so he was a little out of sorts today.  She responded, \"I watched a video once where her mom got her twin boys vaccinated.  It didn't turn out real well.\"  There was an awkward pause and she added, \"They got autism.\"  First of all, I had *just* told her that I had my kid vaccinated.  I can't undo it, what's the point of potentially freaking your patient out?  Secondly, I don't think she should be making comments like that.  If she had said that to someone more impressionable, they could have taken it as advice and not continued getting their kids vaccinated just because she's in the medical field. After that, when I was making my follow up appointments, I asked if I could see Dr. P from now on because he's my preference anyway.  They made a note of it in my file, but asked if I would be okay with seeing Dr. W today because he would be out of the office.  I said that was fine.\n\nWhen I saw her today, I had my son with me.  She asked his name and how old he was.  Then she asked if I was breastfeeding (not needed for anything medical, just asking, so it was kind of a personal question).  I told her that I was supplementing as well because I don't make enough milk (I always feel guilty when people ask me and try to explain even though I shouldn't have to).  My baby started fussing at that moment and she says, \"Oh, that makes him sad!\".  Who even says that??  I'm assuming she doesn't have kids and decides to have them someday so she can be completely embarrassed looking back on the comments she makes.",

And I felt like maybe now having met her my fears and feelings would disappear. \n\nI was wrong. 3 days later and I'm not attached to her at all. She feels like a burden and I feel like the worst person in the world for bringing her into this life. I see her and I just apologize and cry to her.

I don't have a wide circle of mom friends locally that I can ask this sort of question, I have only been a mom for two years, and my husband suggested I check out Reddit. \n\nHow often do you realistically want to get pictures of your kids? I see a lot of mini sessions springing up all year around: Valentine's Day, Easter, Mother's Day, First Day of School, Halloween, and Christmas. What is actually realistic? Are all these sessions that kind of \"Pinterest mom\" kinds of pressure?\n\nMy personal inclination is to say like maybe 2 per year, but I want to provide what people are interested in. My inclination toward maybe 2 per year makes me concerned about over-doing sessions if I plan for more. I don't want people to feel like I expect them to book sessions every two months all year round and that's how \"I\" would feel. \n\nI would rather people invest in the pictures they really want to have and for me personally, that has never been mini-sessions. \n\nIf you can't tell, I am a horrible sales person. I don't like to tell people they need to spend money on things that I don't truly believe they need to have. Quality pictures are always worth the investment, but I think it is worth investing in the things that are most important to you, and for me that is: birthdays, family time and traditions, big events, notsomuch the themed shoots.\n\nDiscuss, please. I am truly trying to understand how to better conduct business that meets client needs and expectations, not just mine. Your pictures are about you, not me. And if I want to call myself a professional I feel it is my responsibility to use my vision and skills to make my client's expectations come to reality. Not to tell people what they want, be happy with my work, and them not get what they want. \n\nI don't want to just do what everyone else is doing because it is what is the \"norm\" but I can't just only offer the things I like because my taste is my own.\n\nIf this post isn't allowed, apologies in advance.

            "selftext": "ETA - THANK YOU for all the responses! This is my first post on this sub-reddit and I knew I came to the right place. You all are so encouraging and supportive. Thank you thank you thank you. \n\nThis is very long, I know. But I really need some advice and wanted to be as detailed as possible, so please if you have time can you read and give some advice?\n\nI feel like such a failure of a mother. I have spent my whole life knowing I wanted to be a mother. I grew up babysitting for all the neighbourhood kids. I nannied for a 2 year old at one point. I am a teacher (but I teach high school kids). I have always LOVED spending time with my nephews (there are SEVEN of them!!). I even took care of one of my nephews one day a week from the age of 6 months - 1.5 years. So I guess I expected that \"moming\" would be no problem for me. \n\nWell here I am, 6 months in, and feeling like I am just not cut out for this. My babe has been a tough one from the get-go. He was never a good sleeper (though that is FINALLY improving) and he has always been on the \"fussy\" end of the spectrum. From 0-3 months he slept so much during the day that it wasn't too hard to entertain him when he was awake, but he did require me to constantly bounce him, walk around with him, etc when he was awake. I could not put him down on/in anything, and I also couldn't just sit down and hold him. He has never been a cuddly baby, and never simply wanted to be held or snuggled or rocked. No, he had to be held face out, and walked around the house and bounced. But as I said, the amount of \"wake time\" was minimal so I was only ever doing this for an hour at a time here and there throughout the day. I also chalked it up to being in the fourth trimester and told myself that things would get better. \n\nCut to now: he is 6 months old and things are not better! His wake time between naps is about 2 hours (3 hours before bed) and I am finding it SO hard to parent him during these times. He is only ever happy if I take him for a walk, or take a bath with him. When I do either of those two things he is TOTALLY chill/happy/content. \n\nHere is what a typical 2 hour wake time looks like for us (not including breast feeding, which happens somewhere in there as well): Lay him down on our big foam mat, on his back, and play with him. He will roll around a bit, and play a bit, but he will begin to fuss after 5-10 mins and then slowly escalate to full on crying. Then I try to pull him into my lap. He squirms and thrusts his hips and continues to cry. I try singing to him again. He still cries. I sit him up and give him a toy. He still cries. I give him a teether. He bites it once and then cries more. I try giving him a snack. He cries. Eventually I take him outside and we go for a walk (and then he is perfectly happy and content). It doesn't matter what \"activity\" I start with, it always starts out okay for a few mins and then shortly after he is crying. If I am proactive I might be able to move him from one activity to another before he melts down, but this would literally involve me doing something new with him every five minutes, which is exhausting. \n\nI am at a complete loss as to what to do. I wind up in tears at the end of every day because I am so exhausted. Today I went on FIVE different walks with him (the upside is I'm actually BELOW my pre-prey weight!) and we spent 40 mins in the bath together. But this just doesn't seem sustainable to me. Plus I live in Canada and WINTER IS COMING. \n\nI don't recall any of my nephews being like this. I also can't hear anybody tell me \"'it's just a phase\" one more time, because he has NEVER been chill! So I guess my questions are....Is this normal behaviour for a 6 month old? How should I be responding? I know you \"can't spoil a newborn\" by picking them up/responding to their cries, but at what point does that stop being true? Am I doing something wrong? I don't understand why my baby seems to be so unhappy so often. I love him to pieces but I am also so resentful that I can't enjoy this stage of my child's life because it is SO hard. When I meet up with friends or my sisters, and their babies, I get SO jealous that they seem to just play on the floor contentedly, while I am doing everything in my power to distract mine and keep him from crying.

Anyway, about 2 weeks ago she was in for her 6-week checkup and was prescribed Jolivette (Norethindrone) birth control which was part of our plan. I'm not sure if it's coincidence but since then she's had trouble producing a steady supply of breastmilk for our lil guy. This has been really hard for her because she wanted to really go all-in since this is our last baby and since she doesn't have to work she can really dedicate herself to it. Not to mention money saved on formula! She keeps her fluids up and eats regular meals with a variety of foods. We also got some packets of this horrible smelling stuff that's supposed to increase milk supply. I don't think it's working. I was hoping the excellent ladies of Mommit might have some tips or advise for her..",

            "selftext": "Hello,\n\nMy husband says I should never let our 2.5 year old out of my sight. He gets really worked up that I \"lock our child in the living room\" (put up a baby gate) so I can do housework (for the length of an animated film -1.5 hours?). He says I need to include our son in everything I do, even if it takes longer and that it should only take an hour to do housework, so he doesn't know what I do with my whole day since I'm a SAHM.\n\nHe often cites that \"millions of women do this without problems\" and I should stop acting stupid. So, I'm coming to you with a request for advice: How *do* you do it? Helping with laundry and general tidying up I understand, but the kitchen? -bathrooms? -floors? -cooking?\n\n***\n\n*Addition info and husband help request:*\n\nI had never even held a baby or knew anyone with small children before I got pregnant and I don't have any family near-by to help me. My mom lives out of state, my step-mom is chronically ill, and my MIL is an elderly snowbird. I lost contact with all my single friends from college. I tried to have lunches with them, but my husband complained that the housework was suffering and \"always out\" if I asked to use the truck more than twice a week. So eventually we just stopped meeting.\n\nHowever, my husband recently introduced me to another young mother he works with, so the play dates we've been setting up once a week (at our house) that have been a ray of light!!\n\nAlso, when I talk about needing a break, he says he works 75 hours a week and he doesn't get a break (he's transitioning/overlapping jobs right now). He handles it, like an adult, and he doesn't get to sleep 10 hours a day (I go to bed at 9pm and wake up at 4am -7hrs-, then nap with our son for 1 to 2 hours in the afternoon, so he's not far off) or hang around the house all day. \n\nHe says I'm welcome to go back to work, if I can't handle taking care of our child, and then someone else can raise him, but that totally **not** what I want.\n\nHe started complaining that he needed to \"hire a babysitter for his wife\" and I told him that's not what's said. Since one-third of the work he does is at home, I just wanted him to watch our son while I wash dishes or put away laundry or take a phone call from my mom on my birthday -- but that is asking too much. He's doing the work of four people and can't be distracted.\n\nHe also wants to know why I don't motivate him anymore (I use to write him notes on the whitboard or send him inspirational quotes/pictures/whatever) or why I'm never in the mood for anything. Its like I just don't care about him anymore, I only think about what I need. \n\nI'm not as happy as I use to be, but I'm not sad either. I'm not excited about our future as I use to be, but I still listen to him talk about the things he wants to do. I'm not unhappy, but I'm not the carefree 20 year old girl that inspired him to go after his dreams eight years ago. \n\nAnd the worst part is that I can't explain why I feel like this. I know my husband works his butt off for us, so it's unfair of me to ask for more time for me. Especially since I have \"no time for him\" anymore, despite everything he does for me.\n\nI **don't** want to be ungrateful, he *does* do a lot for us:\n\n* He buys me flowers\n* He's building me shelves for my books\n* He buys the food and pays the bills\n* He haggles with the medical insurance people and phone company\n* He takes me to the bookstore for an hour every couple weeks and takes our son to get lunch\n* He puts water in the inflatable pool so I can swim with our son\n* He takes us to the park\n* He gives our son showers\n* He takes care of the yard and the truck\n* He makes all the repairs around the house \n\nHe says he just feels like we're more like business partners than anything. I've tried to get him to try to schedule some down-time for himself to de-stress, but he says he doesn't *have* any time to give and that's what he needs me for. \n\n***What can I do?***\n\n***\n\n**Edit:** Wow! I was not expecting these answers. I'll try to reply to everyone. My husband is off today and taking a nap....We had a pretty big fight (our first serious fight) today that ended with him telling me I shouldn't be parent; that I need to go get a job, so someone else can watch our child (as I don't seem to care if he gets hurt - by leaving him in the living room while I go in and out); and I've pretty much ruined our marriage by going back on my promise (to take care of things at home plus whatever he needs from me)... so there's that. :\\\n\n**Edit2:** Husband works tomorrow. I will have to reply more then. He's already said that this won't \"just go away\" and that he's waiting for me to talk to him about something, but I have no idea what he's talking about??\n\n**Edit3:** Good morning. I'm not sure I can reply to everyone anymore, but I'll try to answer the ones with questions! \n\nWe talked last night and worked it out a bit. He just wants to make sure I'm committed to the family and our plan for the future. He says I'm very important to him and making this whole thing work. If we are fighting, he can't perform his best at work and that will destroy everything we've worked for. I can't be a little girl anymore, that I need to start acting my age, and take care of my business --stop making excuses-- and if we don't want to be average \"just like every other family\" then I need to make some adjustments to my attitude. He's had to make sacrifices too. \n\nOh, and the the thing he was waiting for me to talk about was: what my problem is and some proposed solutions. He says I have terrible communication and I need to start speaking up about what I want, before it becomes a problem. But that is kinda the problem (as stated in my original post) I don't know what my problem is or how to solve it. What do I need? Am I truly a bad mom because I go in and out of the room? Is it a matter of bad time-management? Is it a matter of being under-stimulated? -overwhelemed? -selfish? How do we come to terms with conflicting parenting styles without fighting?\n\nI feel as though I *have* tried to get us to go out and do things, but my husband always has reasons why we can't. Mainly it's because he doesn't have time, but also: the water park has urine in the water, the ball pit has needles in it, the zoo is hot and boring, the children's museum is full of snotty sick kids -- although he *has* gotten better. We have gone to a couple places now. Although he usually doesn't want us to go new places without him and I don't want him to miss out on the fun either. \n\nAlso, to answer another question, no - I don't have a car. We sold it the week after our son was born. It saves us car and insurance payments.",

Because of that I'm really kind of reeling from our latest conversation.\n\nMy mom knows that we're having a boy, and has been possibly even more ecstatic than we are about this (very very wanted and anticipated) child. She's known that we were seriously considering not circumcising for quite some time now (at this point we are actually 100% sure that we are not going to circumcise), but now that we're nearing our due date (August 29th!) I've been fielding questions from family, mainly because they want to know if we're having a bris (my side is Jewish, although I'm in no way religious) and she's been dancing around the subject more and more. It finally came to a head yesterday, when she brought it up again, and essentially told me that she thinks that we're making a really big mistake, like to the point that our son will live a more difficult life because of it. I stayed calm, since I really didn't want to get into a fight about it, and we ended the call on a relatively good note. We spoke again today, and although she says that she will love my son no matter what - which I completely believe - she reiterated that she thinks we're making a huge mistake. Specifically that we'll make his life more difficult because of bullying, later in life in sexual encounters, and even just going to pee at a urinal. She also said that she thinks that we're \"putting an undue burden on him that [we] won't have to deal with, but he will, for the rest of his life\", and that we're \"taking the easy way out by choosing to not make a decision about what to do\". She also stated that she thinks that my husband and I are trying to be rebellious against religion (she is in no way a religious person either), and that we're being immature. The worst part though, was when she said that I was putting a burden on him.\n\nThe way I see it, we're giving our son the chance to have an intact body the way that nature intended. Although there's no medical reason NOT to do it, other than the typical risks of surgery that come with every minor procedure, there is also no good reason TO do it, unless there's an issue later in life such as phimosis, which wouldn't be known about until later in life, and is relatively rare. I feel like we're making an informed decision, and one that really isn't pertinent to anyone other than myself, my husband, and most importantly, my son.\n\nAm I being a terrible mother already? Am I making the wrong decision for the wrong reasons? Am I being selfish?\n\nI haven't had a huge emotional breakdown once during this pregnancy, and yet this sent me over the edge. I BAWLED after I got off the phone. I told her how hurt I was by what she said, and she said that I had told her to be honest. I had told her to be honest, but this just felt cruel. I honestly don't understand why she thinks that this is such a huge mistake, and other than saying that she thinks that he'll be ridiculed for his penis, I can't figure out why she feels this strongly about such a relatively benign subject.\n\nUGH. This got so long. I just am so upset over this, and I don't know what to think. If you've read this far, thank you, and if you've got any insight, I'd be happy to hear it.",

Well the school chose as a subject a \"Homage to Cri Cri\", a kids songwriter from about 50 years ago. His songs are not something that I play for my kids, because a lot of them are racist, and the rest are just dumb. \nOut of six or seven musical numbers, the school chose three racist ones! Lyrics included: \"little black boy, go wash your face in the ocean, maybe it will lighten up,  and you'll be white enough\" , and \"little watermelon black boy, stop saying such dirty things, I'm going to tell your aunt, and she'll beat you and I will laugh\".... \nCostumes included kids with watermelons on their heads. And then a little girl in blackface came out! I almost died from shock. I took some pics, video, and posted to my Facebook, along with a not happy commentary on the state of racism in our country. \nSince then I have gotten hateful phonecalls, text messages, whatsapp messages, calling me crazy, basically, and saying that I'm \"using pics of the kids and putting them in danger for my own neurotic agenda\". \nHelp?

Possibly 4 but that's a little too far ahead right now. She said the risk after 3 cesareans that my uterus could attach to my scar tissue or other problems goes way up. My first son was a csection because my labor wasn't progressing and his heart rate was dropping. He wasn't gonna come out at 9lb 4oz! So with this next boy we are having a scheduled one. Husband can take off work, no overdue 10 days like the first time. It's fine with me. Cuz apparently it's hard to find a dr that will go along with a VBAC anyways. I've looked into how many you can safely have. Of course everyone is different. I healed well and pretty quickly too. I'm only 28 and I try my best to exercise and eat healthy. I do have diastasis recti and endometriosis. So I just want to hear from some of you other moms. If you've had a csection, how many? Or if you've had a VBAC too? Share your stories if you like.",

Sometimes I feel it but then the next it feels like it's not true and I should just enjoy life. \n\n\n\nI have come to the point where I don't know what to trust. Is this instinct trying to tell me something? Is this paranoia? Is this because I now appreciate life and have something to live for? Is this how Alexander Hamilton felt where he knew he was going to die but didn't know when? What if it's like Harry Houdini, where I have spent my whole life wanting to know about death. How people know they're going to die. How people cope with knowing they're going to die. That when I get my own insight I don't trust it and end up dieing without doing anything I wanted to do. Or maybe, I DO KNOW I am going to die. At some point. Hopefully when I am older and this is just that realization and now the contemplation of how to make the most of my life.\n\n\nHas anyone ever experienced this feeling before? Well, I guess if you did you'd be dead but it's always on my mind and freaks me out.",

Now, I always hear that you should wait and I'm definitely open to that especially if that will be best for future kids and myself. I know it's no cake walk. My few factors for wanting to start young is I want to be a mom, I want kids while I'm fit and healthy and can run around with them, I want to have a big family (3 min, 4 ideal), and I want to be a decently young grandparent. \n\nI've always been told there is no great time to have a kid. I want to travel, but every time I do, I feel like it's detracting away from what I actually want. I'd ask my mom what she thinks, but she died when I was 6 and she was 33. I was the youngest of 4. \n\nSo mommies of Reddit, when did you have your kids and how did it turn out? I'll answer any questions you may have if that I'll help give you advice.\n\nEdit: Wow, love the stories - keep them coming!

I THINK this is what has caused him to start thinking about his mortality, death, etc.\n\nWhen we married he was mid 30s and we had agreed on 2-3 kids and waiting 2 years to start having kids. It was closer to 3 years, we now have a 10 month old. We had said we would try for baby #2 right after a year.\n\nI noticed he has been in a mood lately, and yesterday I agreed that if he told me, I would just listen and not respond (that was his request knowing I wouldn't like to hear what he had to say). So he told me he doesn't want another child because he doesn't want to be an old dad, because he doesn't want to be in poor health when the kid is in their 30s, because he would never meet his grandkids- just like his dad never met our son. I listened and asked if we could have a discussion on this next year. Because I'm also not ready for baby #2 right now - I've gotta lose the baby weight or I'll have an at-risk pregnancy. Plus, I had promised just to listen and not discuss. \n\nBut you guys- I'm heartbroken. We had even agreed that if baby #2 was a boy we would try a 3rd time for a girl. Now, the thought of having an only child makes me so sad! I realize we are blessed to even have this little guy, so please don't think I'm ungrateful. It is just such a change in what I had always envisioned as my family. \n\nAny thoughts/comments/suggestions?  Could this just be a mid life crisis thing where his fears of not being around for his kids, change later on? He is in excellent shape &amp; health.",

            "selftext": "&gt; Dearest,\n\n&gt;Let me start by saying I love you, and its ok for you to be wrong.\nBelow, you will find the clear, logical reasons that I will need to take the PS4 to [work trip].\n&gt;I will start with the most obvious: Entertainment- When I was in [location] for 6 sad weeks without you, all I had for entertainment was my laptop. Now, I will admit that it does have a multitude of capabilities, however, it is lacking. I know from experience that it just isn't enough. The tiny screen that somehow constantly has a glare, no matter the level of light, WILL give me a headache. The games I have on it have reached the level of maximum saturation and I just can't quite find the entertainment any longer. When I'm not [working] there, I won't have the benefit of a set schedule. \u2026when it's time to relax, the playstation will fill that solidly and keep me from getting restless.\n &gt;Money- Having the playstation (hooked up to the TV in my room that will be larger than this tiny laptop screen) will be able to deliver a vast amount of entertainment, keeping me from going out to the shitty, overpriced pool halls or movie theaters that proliferate any area surrounding [here].\n &gt;It won't be as hard back here as you think- I understand your biggest holdup on my taking the playstation isn't your doubt of the benefit to me, but instead, you're afraid of how difficult it might be here without it. Once you have your new laptop from [your job], we will suddenly have a spare computer on our hands. We can hook up either one of our laptops to the tv (via hdmi or usb) and keep the same amount of entertainment level the family has now. I'm the only one who uses the playstation for anything other than movies (both laptops have dvd drives) or netflix/amazon (both can be streamed through the laptop). We can set up a bookmark folder that would have everything your mom might need, ie netflix, amazon prime, youtube.\nIn conclusion, while it may take a bit of adjustment, the evidence shows that the benefit to my sanity vastly overshadows the minor and temporary inconvenience that may be caused by my taking the playstation to [work]. \n\n&gt;Love, forever and always,\n\n&gt;Your faithful husband,\n\n&gt;PS You're beautiful and thank you for agreeing with me\n\n*edited out personal identifying info*",

I thought 'she won't need to cry if we meet all her needs'. Etc., etc. I thought we could handle this. I thought we could do it well and love her and be there for her in a way we never experienced with our own parents. I never knew how hard it was, how much it eats you up, and how it's the best thing in the world as well as the worst.\n\nI've been breastfeeding for 3 months, since she was born. That's getting up multiple times a night to feed her and rock her back to sleep. I'm there for her every moment of every day, playing, singing, rocking, bouncing, feeding, laughing, crying, changing, you name it. In these first months she's cried for weeks when we didn't know why, eventually to figure it out. Sometimes not. For the first month or two it's a thankless job, there is no emotional response on their part. Then they start to smile and laugh, and that makes 70-80% of the shitstorm better. She cries in the car seat and she cries in the stroller and she cries in the carrier. She won't sleep if you put her down so she's perpetually in my arms. It's beautiful and wonderful and so so hard. I eat with her sleeping in my arms, half my food ending up on her clothes. Sometimes it's funny, sometimes frustrating. She wakes up at night needing to be fed and I used to be able to put her down and she'd fall right asleep but now she needs to be rocked back to sleep for an hour. Sometimes you go a week and things seem awesome, she's calm and happy and sleeps well. Then you hit a growth spurt and all hell breaks loose. There are growth spurts and teething and sleep regressions and developmental things, some you don't know anything about and other instances that have no name. It's like groping your way through a dark hallway for months with no end in sight. Sometimes I feel like my life is over, I never have time for yoga again, never time for a hot bath. I won't be able to go out or even go for a stroller walk, and any sense of me has pretty much evaporated once she arrived. Everything is on her schedule and according to her needs, like a beautiful beloved tiny dictator. I spend hours rocking her, trying to get her to sleep, coffee gets cold (if I even get to it). Once she falls asleep, bam, she's up in half an hour, tired, but she wants to play. Go figure. Husband has to work nights because he wants to be there for us in the day. We don't go to sleep together anymore because he helps put us to bed and goes to his office to make up his missed hours. We give each other an hour break daily and I get anxiety about trying to fit my needs within that time. Shower? Nap? Shit just spent 10 minutes trying to decide what to do, 50 minutes left. Need to make dinner, ah a 'break' from the boob monster but wait, she wants to suck so I drop everything and hubby has to take over. I have to rock her for an hour again. She falls asleep, and wakes up once food is ready. We eat for 10-15 minutes while she's on the playmat (if she'll have it) and then it's back to rocking her to sleep again. You lay down to sleep yourself and she's up in two hours. Rinse, repeat. The dogs don't get much attention anymore which makes us feel like terrible people. I'm terrified I'll not sleep for the next 3 years and then have another kid so add on to that. Feels like my basic needs are of least priority now. And I'm lucky, I have a wonderful baby who isn't any sort of especially difficult and a husband who is super involved and supportive.\n\nBut it's also probably the biggest and best investment I'll ever work my ass off for. She will have had parents who were truly there for her, nurtured her. Hearing her first cry was incredible even though my birth sucked majorly. Seeing her look at me first thing in the morning and smile, priceless. Hearing her giggle, seeing her gaze at you lovingly, watching her be content with her life, her need for you as her comfort. I've never loved like that. She's my insides, my whole heart. \n\nIt's so, so incredibly hard and such a big jump, at least for me. It's a lot of doing what's best for her, and not much of doing things that you need to or may want to do. It's her 24/7 if you're home with them. I thought I knew so much, I never realized the astounding enormity of their newfound presence in your life. You can't go back, but you also don't want to. I'd love to just bunch up under my covers and hibernate for the next week. But even as I write this, little lady is on the boob, sleeping. It's overwhelming and depressing, it's beautiful and incredible. It's the best and worst thing you'll ever do. \n\nEnd rant. Thanks for hearing me out.",

One second he is under my kitchen chairs taking the nuts and bolts off of the legs (choking hazard) and the next second he is in a corner playing with a spider. As I am writing this he has found his brother's mardi gras beads from a birthday party yesterday and he is putting them around his neck. He is constantly doing really dangerous things. I feel guilty. I watch him all day. People say I'm very protective and a good mom. Now he has an outlet cover and is trying to find an outlet to stick it in. I don't even know where he got it. I don't think that anyone realizes how many close calls I have had with him. I have pulled screws out of his mouth. I have caught him taking outlet covers out. He dissects the carpet  edges and plays with the carpet tack strips underneath. I have caught him attempting to plug things into various computer ports. I can't keep everything away from him. He has a metal play yard but he can climb out. I have multiple baby gates to create corridors in my house and he is learning to open them. I follow him around. I can't look away for a second. I can't sit down. I can't use the bathroom without him. He never stops climbing. He never stops falling. All day every single day. I am so exhausted. Why does he have so many instincts to kill himself? Why can't he enjoy toys as much as sharp pointy or tiny objects? He runs FAST in public. He will find stickers on shopping carts and try to eat them while we are shopping. He grabs cans off of shelves and knocks them down if I get close enough to reach myself something from a shelf. As I wrote this previous sentence I looked down. He just had something small in his hand. It's a tiny screw! NO! It's from what is supposed to be a baby safe helicopter toy. He has manged to get the screw out! I don't even know how! I can't believe I was just writing about this and he did exactly what I was writing about! Like I said I can't look away for a second. There is no point in writing. I'm just venting. I love my little boy and I can't lose him. I'm trying so hard to keep him safe but I am no match for him. I wish we had a designated room with no furniture or outlets and every toy in plain sight in a circle around me. I would shut us into the room and then he would be safe as long as we were in there.

I am not a mom myself so I don't know what goes on with your body after giving birth. (I heard something about a cream for your nipples?!! I saw \"padsicles\" on pinterest?! lol) Are there certain things you ladies would have liked to receive for yourself?\n\nAlso, I'm asking because my sister just told our family that she's pregnant! I am super super thrilled and obviously way ahead of time in asking my question haha. \n\n\n*Edit- The response from this subreddit has been abundantly great! I now have a better understanding of what would comfort a mother who just gave birth. Be it through her own time to catch some zzz's, a nice relaxing herbal bath with candles, a clean house to come home to,  favorite snacks and a big water bottle in reach, easy prepped meals or yummy take-out, and things to help with baby- uhm boppy? I just learned what the heck that was- awesome! Obviously there was way more discussed in here and every single suggestion was definitely saved :) Even though her journey's just begun, we all can't wait!!\n\nKeep on rockin', moms! &lt;3",

At first I was nervous because all the other kids were walking and she's barely crawling and standing on her own. Luckily, she was able to keep up with the older kids.)\n\n\n\n\nWhile the kids were playing, there was this 12 month old girl laying on the ground. My girl went up to her and put her hand on her face. Didn't grab just kind of started to pat her face. Almost instantly, the mother grabbed my daughter's hand, twisted her arm and she fell to the floor. I was SO mad but because we were basically visitors, I didn't want to cause a scene. I let it play out until my girl fell to the floor. Luckily she didn't cry and wasn't phased. The mother apologized and I said quietly, \"Yeah, don't ever grab my kid again.\" and picked up my girl and walked away.\n\n\n\nHow would you have handled this situation? I have never been in this situation before so I wasn't sure what to do. I was SO mad and should have said, \"HEY! RELAX! Don't grab by daughter.\" But I didn't want to be rude because it was our first class. I am sure there will be many more times like this but I was ready to unleash my Momma Bear instincts.",

My husband and I are at a football game today and we are walking to the stadium after paying $20 to park. I have our ten week old baby strapped to me. He's sarcastically telling me to walk faster, saying all these people are passing me, etc. he's basically just miserable to be with, we can't just chill out. He's like \"I would rather b in the stadium!\" Etc. Turns out he led us in the opposite direction of the stadium for 15 minutes. So the stadium is over a mile away. He calls me a cunt when I told him to walk on the inside with our son and pulled him in that direction. He said I shoved him toward other people.\n\n\nThen, we are in the game and it's TOO loud for an infant. I did all this googling beforehand to try and determine if it would be. It was too loud because we got 5th row seats in the endzone. So I'm trying to get the baby out of there and I said I don't need the diaper bag or something and he goes \"don't shout in my ear\" and I said \"then help me! Instead of just telling me what to do\" and he says \"shut the fuck up\". In front of his sister. I said \"oh shut the fuck up?!\" And I stormed out. \n\nI Walked a mile with our baby and no baby carrier Back to our vehicle and had our baby nap and eat. My marriage is the bigger concern. I hate doing anything anymore cause of his Moods. We are in counseling and he has a drinking problem and has stopped drinking.\nI should add that when I was mad I texted him \"go drink\" &amp; he said that really hurt his feelings.\nI don't Know what to do. His dad treats his mom like this. He says there's a problem with how harshly I react to him pushing my buttons and being downright rude. I say: Don't do it in the first place!\nI feel alone as a mother. I'm a stay at home mom and he works. I'm a farm wife so I pay all of our bills, cook, clean, take care of the baby, make marketing decisions for the farm, etc. he does not ever take out the garbage, vacuum, do laundry, etc. He just throws things on the floor. He works 10 hour days in the off season and about 26 hour days during planting and harvest. So I know everything house related is my duty then. But even weekends. I'm with our son 80% of the time.\nWe just got married in January and met not even a year before that. I don't know what to do. The way we communicate is so toxic.\n",

However, it's gotten to the point that diaper blow outs is just an inevitability. Every time he poops. Every. *Time*. Now, I'm not sure if this is normal but I somehow doubt it. My son is 6 months.\n\nWe tried cloth diapering but it didn't work out which is a bummer since I was really looking forward to it. We're also more confident in knowing when his diaper is wet so we really don't need the indicator anymore. Any recommendations on a good diaper? My son has *really* chunky legs and a small waist. The waist never seems tight enough because the poop always squeezes out the back\n\nEdit: additional information, he's 18 pounds and in size 3 which is supposed to be for babies 16-25 pounds I think? My husband wants to try a bigger size but I'm not sure that's the problem. \n\nEdit: Looks like the Walmart brand is out. Definitely going to look into different brands *and* a size up.",

Everyone on this sub is really nice, thanks for putting my mind at ease. \n\n\n\nEdit 2- She was fine! A little cry but soon cheered up.

But then once we made our guest list, we realized that 90% of our guests were traveling, and it was entirely unfair to ask them to leave the smaller kids at home. \n\nAs a compromise, we've rented out our local zoo for the night as our venue. This was for a few reasons, mostly because there is stuff to entertain the kids if they get bored, and also so there is enough room to easily whisk them away from any inappropriate behavior that may (and most likely will) occur. \n\nBut we have decided to have a cut off age for ceremony attendees. The ceremony and reception are both at the zoo, and the ceremony area is adjacent to the children's learning center. I'm going to be hiring a nanny or several (depending on need) for the 20-30 minutes of the ceremony and requesting that the younger kids be brought there.\n\nWhat is the best way to address this with the parents we know? I know I will never make everyone happy, but I am open to hearing any and all suggestions and would really appreciate your perspective on this. Thank you! ",

            "selftext": "Just curious how some of you decided how many kids to have. \nWe have a boy right now who is 17mo. Will be having another baby shortly before his 2nd birthday. Sometimes I think I would like to be done after this baby, but other times I have the number 3 stuck in my head as the perfect number of kids. \nI realize I don't have to decide right away. I'm getting an iud after this pregnancy so we don't have any \"accidents\" while unsure. \nI'm enjoying my boy more and more the older he gets and I am glad him and his sibling will be close in age. He is getting easier to care for and (get a babysitter for) also is able to do more on outings &amp;amp;amp; I find myself longing for the baby stage of my unborn baby to be over with and for new baby to be at this age as well. \nSorry for the rambling but basically I don't like being pregnant and do not like the newborn stage. I basically want to \"get it over with\" to get to the older stages where they are more fun to play/do things with. (Ie, vacations, sports, activities, games) \nAlso, for financial reasons I think 2 would probably be better (able to keep car as second vehicle, travel, buying things for them in general, saving for college) \nAnyway, insight into how you decided would be great :) \n\nEdit: thank you guys so SO much for the input. You don't even know how much of a help this has been to me!! You've all given me such great points and things to think through. I feel confident now about deciding that I only want 2 &amp; will be looking at permanent birth control after this baby :) thanks again!!!! ",

The article has a few mentions of reality -- juggling groceries and a baby -- but falls into the mom-as-superhero trap (and actually uses that word). \n\nI was really hoping this was an article that presents the reality of a post-baby body -- or at least something close to it. I was hoping it would talk about how, unlike what WebMD recommends, losing all of the weight six weeks after birth isn't possible for most people. Or how there are a good number of us who can't lose a pound while breastfeed and even GAIN weight despite watching our diets. Or how post-partum depression is more than depression and includes a wide variety of mood disorders. Or maybe how your body goes haywire when you stop breastfeeding and many people experience a period of depression. How, even a year after a successful, complication-free emergency C-Section, I still have pains in my lower stomach if I roll over too quickly. How having a baby can completely fuck with your periods and make them debilitatingly painful, even if they were pain free before. How the months-and-months-on-end of sleep depravation fucks with your mood. How being a household with two working parents, a single parent, or one working and one stay-at-home parent are all insanely stressful in their own ways. How fucking maddeningly gendered children's clothes and toys are. \n\nOr something. Something of SUBSTANCE.\n\nI'm so tired of reading articles that make motherhood into something off of Pinterest and paint it to be this grand, blissful, \"I became a superhero!\" experience. Don't get me wrong -- my daughter is awesome, and I'd never change a thing. But having a baby fucks up your body for a very long time, and it (may) never be the same again. Can we talk about the reality instead?",

Moving forward - Little People, Melissa and Doug, and Duplo/Lego seem to be where my husband and I are agreeing when it comes to the main toy groups we would like to stick to.

            "selftext": "UPDATE: We are nearly positive the problem is sleep apnea.  He is overweight.  He has a family history.  His breathing patterns at night are consistent with those of obstructive sleep apnea.  Thank you Reddit for your collective knowledge! \n\nI went out to ask him about the apnea, and he had passed out on the couch with a full, cold glass of beer next to him, glasses on, and remote in hand.  I had to physically shake him to rouse him.  We both think this is the possible problem and he's going to pursue weight loss as a course of action until we can schedule a sleep study. \n\nPS-- the people who thought I was super-overreacting by being desperate for a solution to this problem can take a chill pill themselves.  I'm by no means a perfectionist, nor am I uptight about... anything.  My kid eats, sleeps, and gets held or played with whatever feels right for all of us at the time.  I don't expect perfection out of my husband, either, which is why I forgave (but did not forget!) the first time this happened.  Of course I trust him.  I prefaced the whole post with \"wonderful relationship.\"  I believe everything he says.  We just had a very real problem that needed a solution, not more judginess.  \n\nMy husband and I have a wonderful relationship.  We have a happy, healthy 5 1/2 month old son.\n\nAt the beginning of July, when our son was ~2.5 months old, I had to stay at work later than my usual 10PM as the next shift was running extremely late.  I called at 9:30 to let my husband know that he should defrost some more milk-- no answer.  I sent him a Google Hangout message.  No answer.  I sent him a Steam message through my phone, thinking maybe he was playing a video game.  No answer.  I figured he had left his cell phone next to his computer, as he sometimes did, and was in another room with baby.  I tried to call again three times-- thinking certainly he would be getting worried-- but to no avail.  I got home around 11:30 to find a raccoon on my front doorstep.  Fuck if I was going to mess with him!  Went around to the porch to come in the side door.  As soon as I stepped into the porch, I knew something was wrong.  The light was on in the office, and I could hear my son SCREAMING.  That sort of **I am in pain** scream.  I go to open the door to get him-- and the chain is on the door so I can't open it. I yell for my husband, no good (obviously.)  Scream his name.  No good. I am less than 2 feet from my baby, who was in his rocker in his PJ's, with a snuggly blanket around his legs and a pacifier next to his head, but I can't get to him.  I try unsuccessfully to unlock the chain with my hand.  Try to call my husband again.  See/hear his phone right in front of me on the desk.  After what felt like an eternity but was probably 2 or 3 minutes, I grabbed an axe from the porch and lit out after the racoon so I could get in the front door.\n\nI'm thinking the worst.  My husband has had a seizure.  Maybe he's dead.  Maybe he completely lost it and left the house.  Maybe he's drunk off his ass and passed out.  Someone's broken in and tied him up and stolen all of our stuff.  I didn't know what to think, but Momma Bear had kicked in at that point, so I'm sure I was a sight to behold-- running and yelling down my sidewalk at midnight, and waving an old rusty axe.  The racoon didn't move until I got about 5 feet away.  Luckily he took off when I got close.  \n\nI bust in the house, and the bedroom is about 10 feet from the door.  My husband is laying on the bed.  I scream his name from the doorway and run to his side.  He wakes up.  He was **sound the fuck asleep.** Curled up in bed, on top of the covers, in his gym shorts and undershirt.  I yelled \"WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU, OUR SON IS SCREAMING.\"  I came within an inch of throwing the rusty old axe at him.  He wakes up in a daze, wondering what I'm so worked up about.  He finally (after ~5 seconds) gets the message that our son is screaming at the other end of the house.  He goes to get him, still in a daze.  I'm thinking at this point that surely he's drunk.  Why else would he leave our son unattended like that?  Realize my mistake and go take the baby from him as soon as he's picked him up.  I'm still flipping out.  Realize the baby is still freaking out, and I'm not helping that situation, so I calm down some.  Feed the baby and get him to sleep safely in his crib with the monitor on.  Talk to husband, who fell back asleep in the meantime.  He insists he hadn't had anything to drink, and was just very tired, and wanted to rest his back.  And fell asleep.  He told me (and I believe him) that he knew I would be home any minute and the baby was asleep when he left him, and it hadn't been that long-- but that he'd just fallen asleep accidentally.  My issue wasn't that he had fallen asleep while in charge of our son, but that if something had happened (I was stuck at work all night, I was in a car accident, something had happened to my parents and I had to go to the hospital with them, etc) he never would have answered the phone (which had been left in the office, as I thought) or woken up and our son would have been left out there for 9+ hours by himself, crying uncontrollably until he passed out.  \n\nHe apologized and blamed the long work day, and taking care of a baby for 4 hours after that.  He blamed his cell phone for not ringing.  I get on him about making excuses, and he says \"I feel bad enough about this already, alright?  I get it.\" \n\nI'm not sure what happened after that.  The adrenaline faded.  I do remember telling my husband, \"This will never happen again.\"\n\n------\n\nFast forward to tonight.  I worked all day and brought home another infant who belongs to some friends of mine who wanted to attend an outdoor festival.   We have a great time with my 12-year-old brother and the two babies.  Little girl's mom and my mom come to pick up their respective kids.  Husband's had a fair amount of video game time that evening, so I request that I can eat a snack and play some video games.  He's tired.  Fair enough!  Offers to take the baby into the bedroom and watch youtube together so I can play.  Sounds like an awesome idea.  Brings baby out after a little while so I can feed him his before-bedtime solid food.  Take a clean, happy, full baby back into my husband, who's still watching Youtube in the bedroom.  Hand him over and get back to my video game.  About half an hour later, I see a funny Reddit post and send it to my husband's phone.  Don't hear back in ~30 seconds, so I go back to tell him about it.  I get about halfway there before I hear that sound again-- the **I AM IN PAIN AND ANGUISH** scream that makes a mother's heart stop.  Say, \"Oh my god\" and run to his room.  He's face down (well, I say face down-- he can hold his head up great now so he wasn't wallowing in it) in a puddle of drool/spitup, up against the rail, red-faced from crying so hard.  Pick up baby, calm him down, go in to bedroom to ask husband wtf-- and he's there on the bed asleep with the baby monitor on the bed next to him.  Apologizes for not hearing the baby.  Baby is soaked, so go to change him and only get halfway through before going back into the bedroom to tell my husband that he needs to get up and change the sheet and blanket in the crib.  He must have been really out of it because he asked my \"why\" after I'd just told him that our son was screaming in a pool of drool.  This whole time my son is just clinging to me, quiet as a mouse.  It was almost like he was in shock-- but once I sat down with him to feed him, he was all smiles and cuddles.  He went right to sleep.  I rocked him for about half an hour after he fell asleep, thinking how precious he is, and marveling at how his loving, doting Daddy could possibly abandon him like that AGAIN.  This time my husband was much less apologetic and was in and out of sleep the whole time I tried to talk to him about it.  I gave up but was too worked up to try to go to sleep.\n\nI debated calling my mother, but she'd never forgive him.  I thought about calling a friend, but it was late and all of our friends are mutual friends-- and I feel like it would be a huge breach of trust to talk about this very sensitive, personal problem with a friend of his.  So, I turn to you, Reddit.  I'm afraid to leave him at home with my husband at night.  I work 3 nights a week though-- and we can't go without that income.  My husband doesn't think that his is a very big deal, but to me it's a HUGE deal.  These are situations that ended in pretty much the best possible way, with Momma swooping in to rescue screaming baby while Daddy snoozes, and everyone is OK in the end.  To me, this is a much bigger deal with potentially deadly consequences. \n\nPlease help.",

            "selftext": "What is the best way to deal with a family member who likes to buy useless or one use items as gifts?  My MIL is being very thoughtful and loves buying stuff for her kids (and now grandchild).  More often than not we end up with things we aren't going to use or that just take up space.  \n\nI should mention that she has no concept of clutter. She and my FIL probably still have everything they have ever brought ever, as well as stuff that other people were getting rid of.  Currently I know they are on their way down with a 25 year old Little Tykes slide that her youngest son had.  Her kitchen is over flowing with gadgets that are for one specific function.  Last time she was out here she randomly got us a salt block for cooking food on. It is neat, but pointles and takes up space. We barely have room for the things we DO use, let alone something that we will use once as a gimmick.\n\nI would like to nip this in the bud now before it becomes a bigger issue with my daughter, but want to do so as nicely as possible.  I know she is just being thoughtful so I don't want to insult her.  She can sometimes take things the wrong way and be very passive-aggressive about it.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nEdit:  As this is getting bigger than I expected, I am going to start listing some of the suggestions from below for the people coming here for that reason.\n\n- Being honest and forward about not needing things.  Many below have tried this and it has either worked with mixed results or hasn't worked at all.  Eventually you may just need to gently hurt feelings by returning items to stores, donating them to Goodwill, or flat out sending them back with the giver.\n\n- Have them keep the toys at their house.  This would work especially well if you are visiting them a lot or your child stays there a lot.  In our case they are 8 hours away so it isn't a good option, especially since we are trying to keep them from adding mroestuff to their over-filled house.\n\n- Divert the energy from buying things into somethine else.  Experiences such as memberships to museums or zoos were one way to do this.  We belong to a Fine Arts museum that has art classes from infants on up, and so far they have been fun.  We may try and ask for gift certificates towards her classes.  College funds such as 529 plans that anyone can contribute to was another suggestion.\n\n- Flat out tell them exactly what you need.  As one person said \"I know you are awesome with finding things at garage sales. We could really use a ______. Call me if you see one!\" If they are the type that likes to buy things for people, they will likely just pay for it themselves.",

            "selftext": "My daughter is finishing up 7th grade, having been a stellar student her entire academic career. She's earned top grades, and she's also a student-athlete, active in track and cross-country running, and a member of the drama club and the band. She is more mature than her peer group; she's had a lot to deal with in her young life, including the loss of her dad six years ago after a prolonged illness. \n\nShe asked me if she could skip 8th grade because most of her friends are a year ahead of her in school, but I think that's a lousy reason to skip a grade. High school is characterized by change, and the friends she has now may not be her besties a year from now. I'm also concerned that the other student-athletes would have a one-year competitive edge on my daughter, and that she'd lose out on at least one or two performances with the drama club. \n\nMy first instinct is to say no, but I told her that I would consider the question fairly, so I'm asking moms: What do you think?\n\n\nUPDATE: She didn't want to wait until dinner. She's been texting and Skyping with her friends all day to come up with her lists, and she decided all by herself that she doesn't want to skip 8th grade after all. We talked it over, and I reiterated some of the points you kind ladies made. I was actually leaning toward letting her skip (at one point, I think I was even trying to talk her into it), but I guess the point is moot now. \n\nHer reasons for not wanting to skip are, in _her_ order of importance: \n\n(1) she wants that extra year to grow and train and hopefully win some sports scholarships to fund her education (I told her about \"redshirting,\" but she doesn't want to repeat the 7th grade for the sake of college money...bit of a disappointment, that)\n\n(2) she doesn't want to miss the class trip to Memphis (Ha! I called that one)\n\n(3) her friends in drama club who are graduating this year told her the thing they would miss most about school was being in drama club, and that she's nuts for wanting to miss even one production and they would give anything to be in just _one more show_ and I think I heard one of them crying (oh, drama club!)\n\n(4) she's the smartest kid in the class, but if she skipped, she wouldn't be anymore and she likes being special\n\n(5) she likes not having to spend a lot of time studying because it gives her time for other other interests (\"School is easy. I don't want it to be too hard. [I don't have time for more homework](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/284/529/e65.gif).\")\n\nWe also talked about AP classes, and she's just as happy to do that and get a headstart on college instead of missing out on a year of her childhood. And we left the door open for future grade skipping, in case she changes her mind. I'm proud of her for making an informed decision. She had more reasons, but those were the top 5.

Our daughter, who is autistic, is still unable to say more than a very small selection of words, which prevents her from saying the reassuring \"i love you\" or \"I'm happy\" that makes each difficult day melt away for a mom.\n\nOur children both have endless opportunity and adventure ahead in their lives, and for mother's day I'd like to give my wife a glimpse of what that future could be. We've always hoped that they would travel the world, find joy in every situation, and simply let us know that they're a bright spot in someone's day.\n\nThat's where you come in, /mommit. Could you spare a moment to write a very brief postcard to my wife, from either my daughter or son, giving a glimpse into the joy of their life in your part of the world. If you live in Seattle, tell her about how it really does rain as much as they say, and the new job is going well. If you live in Costa Rica, you got to pet a sloth, and it was AMAZING.\n\nIf you're willing to take the time and effort to help, please PM me your location so I can give you the name of my daughter/son, our address, and extend my gratitude. \n\nthanks",

            "selftext": "Ok, right off the bat -- I have **no problem whatsoever** with how many kids people have -- one, more, none are all valid in my book. This is NOT an attempt to bash parents of multiple kids.\n\nThat said, I am the only one among my friends and acquaintences who has chosen to stick with one, and it's a bit isolating. I don't know if it's just where I live or a universal thing, but my son was barely born before people were asking about when we'd have our next one. And for a while, we did contemplate it.  But with one thing and another, we've decided that 3 is a good size for our family, so one and done it is.\n\nThe problem is that now when I get the \"when will you give him a sibling\" question, and I say \"we're done,\" I get generally negative reactions. People question our reasons, argue with me (not my husband -- he never gets this!), act like I must be some frigid, baby-hating bitch...it's depressing, and I never know how to respond.\n\nMy husband makes fun of me for needing other people to validate my decisions, but he also isn't the one with the endless \"WHY DON'T YOU WANT ANOTHER BABY?!?\" refrain. So I come to you, parents of Mommit...Do you get these questions? What do you tell people? \n\n**TL;DR: Give me a good come-back to the nosy questions that doesn't implicitly criticize someone else's family decisions.**\n\nEDIT: Wow, thank you for all the positive comments! :-) There are so many great ideas in here!

            "selftext": "Apologies in advance for the length of this, but I think backstory and examples are necessary here. \n\nMy son just turned three. He is extremely intelligent. The psychiatrist we've been seeing for his issues suggested development testing and he scored highly gifted. He may be a smart boy, but he also has the worst behavior of any three-year-old child I have ever seen.\n\nSome backstory. He has been a difficult child since birth. He was up 5-6 times per night until he was 14 months old. At the age of 3, he still doesn\u2019t sleep through the night most nights. He also had colic, and screamed close to 8 hours a day for months on end. He is sick all the time. He will go maybe a week without cold symptoms and then be sick for months on end (we\u2019ve investigated allergies but he has tested negative for everything so far). He also has gastrointestinal problems. He\u2019s had borderline diarrhea since starting on solid food (we\u2019ve tried various elimination diets but nothing has made a difference). He also has never been able to play happily on his own, always requiring someone to be with him, entertaining him. On a great day, he\u2019ll play on his own happily for five minutes. Tops. \n\nHe has an incredible impulse control problem. He is violent with me, his father, and the other kids at his daycare. The violence is very typically unprovoked. For example, last week he got out of his cot during nap at daycare, picked up a shoe and hit another sleeping child in the head. According to the staff, she and my son hadn't even played together that day.  He will walk up to me while I\u2019m cooking dinner and hit me with his toys. When I react in pain, he often laughs.\n\nHe has no attention span. He cannot even maintain eye contact with you when you are trying to talk to him, always looking around for other things he can focus on. He has no patience and no fuse. If something doesn\u2019t go his way, he erupts in anger immediately, screaming, crying, throwing things, or hitting whoever happens to be nearby.  \n\nHe is also hyperactive. He never walks anywhere, even in the house. He runs and jumps. He cannot sit still for more than 10 seconds (unless we are reading to him). And he never shuts his mouth. He literally must be talking ever second of every day. We never get a break.\n\nHe is also not yet potty trained. He knows how to use the potty, but chooses not to. He'd rather go in his pull-ups, and then laughs when we have to change them. We have tried putting him in underwear, but he pees and poops in that too. \n\nEveryday when I pick him up from daycare, I get the \u201cdamage report\u201d: how many other children he hurt, how many naps he disrupted etc. Between the potty training, the refusal to nap and the violent behavior with other children, the daycare is threatening to kick him out. And I can\u2019t blame them. I\u2019d kick him out too.\n\nI want to be clear: I do not have unrealistic expectations for my child. He's three. I expect a certain amount of violence, tantrums, impulse control problems, hyperactivity etc. My issue is that he is off the chart on all these things when compared to his peers. And we have tried EVERYTHING to improve his behavior: rewards, praise, negative reinforcement, punishment (i.e. taking toys away), timeouts, counting\u2026 everything. We have done exhaustive investigations of his health issues, spanning allergy testing, dietary changes, family doctors, specialists, psychiatrists, counselors\u2026 nothing has helped.\n\nBottom line is, because of all these issues, I have never felt attachment to this child, and grow more distant from him after every battle, every violent outburst. My resentment for him grows. I resent him because we always wanted to have two kids, but there is no way we will have a second one after him. I resent him because he has therefore robbed me of my opportunity to parent a normal, loving child.  I resent him because he loves his father more than he loves me, even when he is the disciplinarian and I am not.  I resent him because I go to bed each and every day exhausted, angry and broken, on the verge of an anxiety attack.  I resent him because instead of enjoying time playing with my child, I dread it because I know it will only end in one of us screaming, and me with some kind of physical injury.\n\nSo, r/mommit\u2026 where do I go from here? I am desperate. I have tried parental counseling, as well as child psychiatry with no help.  We cannot ask for more childcare from my family, and cannot afford to hire outside babysitting right now.  I need to get these feelings of distance and resentment under control, so that I can be a better parent. I need to fix his behaviours so that I don\u2019t have a mental breakdown. \n\nThanks to everyone who made it through this monster post. I\u2019ll take any and all advice/criticism/suggestion.\n",

Lucky for me, I can take the baby to work so when my husband is working, I take the baby, but I can't get very much done. On days (like today) that my husband is off, I leave the baby at home with him in the hopes of getting a lot done.\n\nBut every time my husband has the baby, I will get at least one, usually two or three phone calls of, \"I can't take this, I can't!\" with background noise of our son screaming his head off.\n\nThe last time this happened, my husband guilt-tripped me into driving home and comforting the baby (which took like, 2 minutes) while he did some paperwork for his new job. I felt like this was wholly unacceptable.\n\nMy husband gets so out of sorts that he'll yell on the phone at me about the baby not shutting up, which of course hurts the baby's ears and makes him cry louder. Wtf is wrong with my husband that he doesn't understand that this is going to be the case?\n\nMy husband took care of his twin nieces when they were infants, he knows what he's doing... or he should. I'm the one who never even touched a baby before holding my own, I don't know how I am able to do this parent thing better than he can.\n\nI don't know what to do, I can't take the baby EVERY day because some days I just need to get work done. He should be able to handle the baby, there's no reason the baby should be wailing so much! And he acts so put-upon when he has to do simple things like feed and change him, and hold him.\n\nHe just called me again, \"he wants to be fed AND held at the same time, what the fuck, this is annoying!\" Holy shit. I don't even know what to say anymore.\n\nEdit: Oh, and the baby sleeps well at night! All night! We get a lot of sleep, so we're not sleep-deprived and at each other's throats for that reason, at all.",

            "selftext": "Long story short, I have 6 kids, a husband and a roommate. 2 of my kids are special needs, my husband is an epileptic (who also works 13 hours a day),and my roommate suffered an injury at work that left him with 2 broken arms, screws and plates and everything else in his elbows. \n\nMy kids are 10, 7, 6, 4, 2, and 5 months. No need to really explain what goes into being a Mom, you guys already know. My husband is on meds that make him tired, and when a seizure is coming on, he is basically useless. Also, after a seizure, he weak and shaky, and there's not much we can do until it just totally passes. My roommate is in a mechanical brace, double casts, has insurance that won't cover in home nursing, and I'm his sole caregiver. That means I feed him, I dispense his meds, I bathe him, and yes, I even wipe his butt. On top of that, he was his 96 year old grandmother's only assistant. Her house burned down a few months ago, and she is in assisted living, at the moment. I hold her power of attorney since the roommate broke his arms. \n\nAt the moment, there are 9 people semi or fully dependent on me. The only help I have is a friend that sits with the kids for about 2 hours twice a week, so that I can devote myself to cleaning and get a shower. \n\nNeedless to say, there are not enough hours in the day. The house is dirty (really dirty), I'm 3 weeks behind in clearing permits at work (could potentially get my business shut down), I haven't cooked a real meal in over a week, nor have I eaten one. I was so tired last night that I nearly gave my son my roommate's morphine and nearly gave my roommate my son's antipsychotics. Getting my kids dressed for school this morning involved digging through the dirty clothes with a bottle of Febreze because I simply didn't get to laundry. I can't do this, there simply isn't enough time in the day, even if I cut out sleeping (which, fuck it, I pretty much have already). My ten year old is helping as much as she can, but I'm not going to put too much on her. My seven year old is schizophrenic (literally, that's the diagnosis) and my 6 year old has a cystic fibrosis variant, so they are less than no help. (Not that I can blame them, it's just the way it is.) \n\nWhat the hell can I cut out, just to save some more time? I'm already feeding all of us out of the microwave, off of paper plates at that. I have asked every single person I know for help, fat lot of good that did me, and I\"m pretty sure that at some point pretty soon, I'm just going to fall down on the floor and sleep whether or not I can afford to at that moment. \n\n\nEDIT: Thank you guys, so much for the suggestions, and a good deal of them will be used. People at my husband's work donated vacation days, and he has a solid week off to help me. \n",

Breast feeding. I know I know, I've read how beneficial it is, and no pumping isn't an option for me either. That being said, please don't judge too much, although I welcome well placed ADVICE, I'm trying to get information from mom's who've bottle/formula fed from the start. How do you approach that with doc? How to start and deal with it at the hospital? What formula is the best to start with? I really want to know from some women who've been there if possible, or if you know someone who took this approach, but again any advice is welcome.\n",

My husband and I have no problem whatsoever with his interest in the doll, and find it to be a normal healthy interest. With that aside, my dolly is past her prime and I worry about her being destroyed or becoming a choking hazard. So we only have short visits with her, and my son loves his play time with her. To be honest she has a few holes in her stuffing and is kind of creepy looking. So, I would really like to replace the doll with an anatomically accurate baby boy doll for my little man. He really enjoys looking at her ears, feet, hands, and eyes and I think this could be a great developmental tool. I am interested in your thoughts. Would you do the same for your son? Where would be the best place to buy one? We want our son to grow up without feeling he must only do \"boy\" things, but worry family or friends may criticize his having a doll. Thoughts? Experience in this? Thanks in advance Mommies!\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for your insightful, accepting, and positive  responses! I really appreciate the advice, ideas, and perspective. I am truly overwhelmed and very delighted with the overall positive take on this topic. You all seem like fabulous moms! I definitely do plan to get my boy a dolly of his own now, no shame!

When it was time to leave, I told A she could pick out a book at the book store. She selected a Sophia the First book, which is one of the few princesses I don't entirely mind.\n     \nWaiting in line to buy the book, A got out of our sit n stand stroller because she wanted to put the book on the counter. E started getting angry that A was allowed to walk around and yet she was stuck in the stroller like some kind of chump. Because of this, I asked A to get in the stroller and she could put the book on the counter from there. This is, apparently, where I went wrong. By avoiding a mini-tantrum from the 1 yr old, I inadvertently set into motion the beginning of a great, gigantic tantrum from the 5 yr old.\n    \n After arguing with me (apparently she thought I thought she couldn't reach the counter without being in the stroller - and that was a direct threat to her ability to be a \"big girl\") we walk up to the counter and A chucks the goddamn book on the counter. Now, seeing as she is usually my good one (E throws things regularly), I was momentarily taken aback and thought it was an accident. But one look at her stubborn-set chin and fierce blue eyes told me that she'd done this deliberately. She was testing me.\n     \nGame on.\n    \n I pick the book off the counter and say, \"If you don't apologize to the cashier, you will not be getting this book.\"\nThe waterworks started immediately. She grabs the book from my hand and tosses it on the counter again, while telling me that she won't apologize.\n    \n At that moment, I had a decision to make. The tears were already here, the screams were likely on their way. I had a split-second to decide how I would handle this: Give in and buy the little brat her the book, or haul a very pissed off, very loud 5 yr old out to the car. Just glancing at the daring, almost menacing glare she shot me, gave me my answer.\n     \nI calmly handed the book to the cashier, apologized and told him we wouldn't be buying the book. I'm not sure if he ever said anything. The screams had begun, and with them, came stomps on the stroller, mad words, and screeching pleas to let her say sorry so we could buy the book. As best I could, I ignored the disapproving looks from strangers as I pushed my stroller - complete with raging five year old.\n     \nWe got to the car, and A was still pissed at me. She got into the car and did the thing where the door didn't slam loud enough the first time so she kept opening it and slamming it shut again. After the third time, I put an end to that, too. We talked on the way home - after she'd calmed down - about her feelings at  the time of the incident, and how she felt afterwards.\n     \nNow we're home, and I made she sure understood why she wasn't going to get the book. Not today. Not tomorrow. Perhaps not anytime in the near future. And as I recounted the story in my mind, I remembered the disapproving strangers and I questioned myself. Had I dealt with that scenario the \"right\" way? In the second I had to react and make a choice on how to deal with A and her 'tude, my first instinct had been to give in. Is that what I should've done? After all, it's only a book.\n    \n But giving in would've been the easy thing to do. By giving into your child's tantrums, you're not only potentially creating a bigger problem for yourself, you're letting your kid down. Your job is to teach them how to function properly in society. To be considerate of others. To continue on and control your temper even if something doesn't go your way.\n    \nSo despite the judgmental glares and tsks of people I don't know, I stand by my choice. For my child's sake, I refrained from taking the easy way out. And I can only hope that, at the very least, she grew a little because of it. I know I have.",

Two of my good friends just had babies within the last 7 months and they like to tell stories about their experience and we all enjoy listening to them. A lot of times, we talk about friends of friends and their experiences, too. I have heard from a few women that, through pregnancy and even up to the first stages of labor, they did not want an epidural but the contractions were too much and got the epidural. I was just wondering if it's a pain tolerance thing or an easy temptation, etc. Have any of you went in NOT wanting an epidural but ended up getting one anyway? And, why did you change your mind? I'm just curious...thanks!",

He is also very clingy and needy. I have been reading The Wonder Weeks and it seems like this is very normal but I can't seem to get anything done. He wants to be held all day. If I put him down and walk a few feet away he crawls over and stands up pulling on my leg which leaves me unable to move. If I move him he'll just do it again. He usually throws a tantrum if I dont pick him up or I finish what I'm doing. A few times this has led to him falling and banging his head.\n If I put him in anything that restricts him moving around the house (playpen, swing, exersaucer) he freaks out. I know it's probably ok to let him cry for a few minutes but it makes me so anxious and gives me a headache. Not to mention it makes me really sad. \n:( I worry he is stressing out his brain or something.\n\nI've tried using an Ergobay carrier but he doesn't care for that unless we are outside. \nI am not getting anything done unless he's sleeping and sometimes if he falls asleep on the boob I just have to leave him bc he wakes up if I move him and I'd much rather have a few quiet moments to play on my phone or watch tv instead of him waking up and being cranky. His nap(s) is usually only 30 minutes anyway. \nHe has a bunch of toys but doesn't seem very interested in them unless I'm playing with him. He loves the Baby Einstein movies but it really only keeps his attention for 5 minutes or so. \n\nHow do you ladies get stuff done in your house? Is it while they are napping mostly? I feel like I never get a break! I forget to feed myself most days and can't get a shower in until my husband comes home. \n\nSorry for the rant/rambling. Thanks in advance for advice!\n\n\n",

            "selftext": "I've been trying to phrase this question to search on it, but I can't get it to be concise and to the point.\n\nSo, here we go. I also posted this in /r/babybumps.\n\nWhen teaching a child his/her first words, did you or do you plan on teaching \"Mama\" and \"Dada\"?\n\nThe words \"Mama\" and \"Dada\" just kind of rub me the wrong way, but maybe they won't if I understand. You see, I would really like if our child would learn to call us \"Mom\" and \"Dad\", because I just feel cringy when ever I hear a child that speaks clearly still saying \"Mama\" and \"Dada\". I understand that the repetition sticks for babies, but do you absolutely have to teach them \"Mama\" and \"Dada\" as their first words? Will it affect the child's ability to learn language if you teach your baby you are \"Mom\", you are \"Dad\" rather than \"Mama\" and \"Dada\"?\n\nWhat did you teach your child to call you? Did you start out as \"Mama\" and \"Dada\" and then once their language was developed a decent bit switch it to \"Now I am 'Mom'/'Dad'\"?\n\nI know this is probably a silly question, but it has been on my mind since before I was ever even thinking about pregnancy. I see my friend's kids and they all learned \"Mama\" and \"Dada\" but it's been a handful of years and that still has yet to change for those kids and now that they are talking in sentences I get bit of a cringe every time I hear them say something like, \"Mama/Dada, this and that, this is a full sentence.\" You know? I feel as if it's impressive in the sentence moment, but sounds so silly by the baby-like title.\n\nShould we start out with \"mama\" and \"dada\" and then move on to \"mom\" or \"mommy\" and \"dad\" or \"daddy\"? Or should we start out with one title and just stick with it? How soon after a child learns \"mama/dada\" do you then start trying to teach them it's now different?\n\nI know, I know, I'm completely over thinking this, and I am sorry, but damn am I curious. Haha.\n\nIs it a bad thing if your child's first word isn't \"mama\" or \"dada\" but instead something like \"kitty\" or \"doggy\" or...idk. If a child can learn a different word as their first word like \"train\" or \"plane\" why can't their first title of their parents be \"mom\" or \"dad\"? I mean, I may be crazy, but my godson's mother was cooing over him the other day and going on and on about how his first word was \"dada\" and \"did you hear him say it!\" But all it sounds like to me was babble. Then his five year old brother came by and said \"Hey!\" and crystal clear I, swear there was no mistaking it, I heard my godson say \"Hey!\" right back. I was like, \"Did he just say 'Hey'?\" and his mother responded, \"Nah, that's just him making noise. But...like...It didn't sound like a babble I heard before when he supposedly said \"dada\".\n\nI'd just really like some insight into a baby's first words if anyone has any.",

I told her to MYOB and checked out and walked off.\n\nA family member of mine was horrified that I left my son watch educational cartoons like disney junior. Her son is almost 7 and has never slept on his own which is fine if your co sleeping but she admits to hating it and not being able to control him. She has to buy him a toy every time they go out just to get him through a shopping trip. I don't care how she raises her son but he did poke my son in the eyeball when he was trying to sleep and then lied about it.  \n\nI just am tired of moms being judgmental we all are different all parent different unless your doing something harmful or they ask your advice why can't everyone just relax. \n\nEDIT I have no problem with cosleeping I did it when I was breastfeeding, I was pointing out she hates sleeping with him and admits to failing and she uses her age as an excuse for her bad parenting which I find annoying. I know I sound judgy and I am more just trying to get it out sorry if I ruffled feathers. Everyone judges it is human to judge in your mind but I think it is strange to speak up about it to a stranger just trying to make yourself look better or cause a conflict. ",

I can feel my baby kicking very frequently throughout every single day. Is it normal if a baby kicks this much? Also, I need help with figuring out what I need to buy for my baby. I know that I need the basic things like diapers, a stroller, crib, toys, etc....but I would like to breastfeed and I was wondering where I could buy a breastfeeding pump and if there is anything else i would need to get for breastfeeding. Please let me know of anything that could help me prepare for my first child!! Thank you!",

            "selftext": "Breastfeeding has picked back up in popularity, which is wonderful.. however, I have met some really nosy and judgmental moms recently. I start to mix a bottle for my son, and they immediately jump in and ask why I'm not breastfeeding and if I breastfed my 2 year old son. Here's the thing, after my oldest was born, I had severe PPD. I had the best of intentions to breastfeed. He was nearly 10 lbs when he was born, and wanted to be latched all the time. It didn't help that he had acid reflux, so he was really crabby all the time. Anyway, after a few days of attempting to breastfeed, I began to resent him every time he was hungry. I did not feel like I had bonded or connected with my baby at all. My husband suggested I try formula. With the first bottle, it was like a sigh of relief. A couple months later, I ended up getting on medication for a few months until my hormones leveled out. I never did breastfeed him more than those first couple days. When my second son was born, I will admit it, I didn't even try. I had prenatal depression which turned into full-blown PPD about 24 hours after the baby was born, and I immediately started medication. When I try to somewhat explain this to women who ask why I'm not breastfeeding, they seem to think that I'm just using this as an excuse. They tell me that there were medications I could have taken that would have been safe. They tell me that I was selfish (!!) for choosing my mental health over the long-term benefits for my sons' health. \n\nAnyway. I'm genuinely curious what the majority of women think about this. I don't know if I'm just running into bitchy ladies. On the other hand, maybe I truly should have tried harder to breastfeed both of them. I've experienced a lot of guilt over it. Thoughts? Opinions?\n\nEdit: I just want to say a sincere thank you for all the love, support, and advice I've received. I'm definitely going to do my best to just blow off the people who are bringing such negativity in my life. Thanks /r/mommit.",

I'd love to hear some good stories and I'm sure it would be reassuring for those searching in the future to have them collected in one link.  I realize very few people are lucky enough to have an \"easy\" birth but a girl can have hope, right?\n\nWhat I think disqualifies your birth story as an \"easy\" one:\n\n1.)  Agonizing contractions in early labor (active labor is another story, obviously)\n\n2.)  Anything more than superficial/ first degree tears\n\n3.)  Drugs of any type not working the way they were intended.\n\n4.)  Nearly dying.  Either of you.  That should be a given.\n\n\nIt would be amazing if your story also included:\n\n5.)  No drugs\n\n6.)  First time pregnancy\n\n7.)  Labor being relatively short\n\n\nDo you know what totally unrealistic thing I'd love to hear?  \"I was having very mild cramps but I didn't think anything about it because labor is supposed to be horrible, right?  Well, all of a sudden I felt the need to push and fifteen minutes later my precious little [insert name here] practically fell right out.\"  \n\nIf you are one of the lucky few, please also share your words of wisdom.  Did you do the mommy workouts and squat your way to an \"easy\" birth?  Do you swear by willow bark tea?  Bradley Method?  Buddhist prayers while laboring?  Counter pressure by husband with chilled hands?  Perineal massage with coconut oil?  I'm all ears and taking any suggestion, ladies.  \n",

I tell myself he is going to be a perfect angel, never act out, never beat up on other kids (yeah, I know I'm just dreaming). Anyway, it seems everywhere we go where there are other kids, some toddler or preschooler is harassing my little guy.\n\nHere's an example: We live in a community with a shared pool. We went to the pool today for the first time this season and no less than three kids, aged maybe 3 to 6, came up to me and the baby and started trying to dump water on him, splashing him, trying to grab him away from me -- all the while not a parent was to be seen. \n\nHere's my question...At what point is it OK to discipline another person's kid? One particularly naughty 4-year-old girl who kept repeatedly asking if she could dunk my baby (I kept saying \"No, you may not dunk the baby. It will make him cry and maybe hurt him.\") started getting all grabby and tried to grab my baby's face, then lifted a hard plastic toy over her head and was about to throw it at him. I gently moved her arm away and said \"No. Do not throw that at my baby.\"\n\nAlso, I need to mention that I was in the 1 foot deep baby pool.\n\nI worried some parent would come running over and start a fight with me because I dared touch her kid. This sort of thing happens pretty often and I really don't know how to handle it. Any suggestions? I was thinking of asking the lifeguards to help, but they watched the whole time and didn't seem to care.\n\nEdit: measured the pool, was 1, not 2 feet deep.",

The family legend goes we have been using these names for about 3,000 yrs, beginning in ancient Greece with Helena, Ann getting added sometime down the line and Leigh coming in last when we emigrated to England.   \nAnyway ever since I was a child and made aware of the tradition, I picked out Annabelle Grace as how I would honour the tradition. I am a Leigh, my Mother is a Leigh and my Grandmother and Greatgrandmother were Ann's. So I thought it would be nice to go back to Ann plus I personally don't like Helen. Just never liked the sound of it.    \nI am now pregnant with my first child and my brother's wife was also pregnant with their first child. They just had their baby a few days ago and guess what her name was.... Annebelle Jane.    \nI guess I should've seen it coming and had a talk with them about baby names since we're all very traditional and wish to continue the tradition. I am trying to be happy for them and excited about my new niece but it was like a blow to my stomach when I first heard her name. It feels distressing after imagining my baby girl for so many years to realise I'll never call her my sweet Annabelle.    \nI know I'm hormonal and this is not the end of the world and I should calm down but every time I try to come up with a new name I end up in tears.     \nWe still have 4 months until my due date so we have some time to find a new name and get used to it.  \nI am hoping you guys can help me come with some new names that use Ann or Leigh or both of them.  \nMy husband has suggested just naming her Annabelle Grace anyway since I wanted that name so much but I saw the fights between my mother and my aunt when I was young over baby names for my sisters and cousins and I really don't want a repeat of that in this generation nor do I want to fight with my brother and his wonderful wife.  \nSo Mommit, please help me!",

            "selftext": "My 2 and a half year old daughter is extremely overweight. I've tried everything in my power to help her lose the weight but she doesn't seem to be getting any smaller. \nSome back story. When she was born she was only 6'7 which I'm told is on the small side. She had a few months where she would only fall asleep if I was in the bed with her feeding her a bottle and it usually took a few small bottles to get her to sleep. I indulged her because I was sleep deprived myself and had a pretty severe case of the baby blues. I'm fully aware that wasn't the right thing to do but hindsight is always 20/20. I stopped over feeding her as soon as I realized how bad it got. \nWe've had genetic tests, thyroid tests and such and everything was negative. I've tried feeding her less, feeding her 3 medium sized meals a day with no snacks, feeding her 6 small meals a day, feeding her 3 meals that always followed a pattern (fruit for breakfast, fruit and veggie for lunch, protein and veggie for dinner) and more other ways than I can list. She only drinks skim milk, crystal light, or water. Everything she eats is low fat, fat free, sugar free, or low calorie (though we occasionally give her a piece of chocolate or cookie when she's had a bad day). She plays outside every day and does physical therapy for something unrelated so she gets plenty of exercise. I'm out of ideas and I'm worried for my daughters health. \nSorry for the wall of text. I'm just at my wits end and would be extremely appreciative of any input you moms may have. \n\nWow thank you for all the advice! I didn't expect nearly this much. I don't have time to respond to everyone right now but know how helpful all of you have been!",

            "selftext": "Well, I guess this is as good a time as any for an intro. I am 23, and have an 18 month old son. My husband is currently deployed, so I'm here all day every day by myself. My parenting style is love whenever I can, but not to coddle. I will let my son cry it out, but only to a certain extent. And this is where it all begins.\n\nI think I made a mistake by posting what happened as a status on Facebook. The base we are at is a very little town, and a LOT of the spouses find that their hobby is to talk shit (sorry for language) and start drama. Anyways, what happened was:\n\nLast night, I put my son down for bed pretty late, because I didn't get out of the gym until pretty late. In the middle of the night, he woke up and started whimpering, usually he does this if he has a bad dream or wakes up without the pacifier in his mouth. Since I am trying to get rid of the pacifier, I decided to let him cry it out, eventually he will go back to sleep, right? So I hopped in the shower, and I ended up taking a really long one (I really felt like I needed it.)\n\nWhen I got out of the shower, he was still crying. Since I knew that was out of character for him, I went to check on him and give him love. I am guessing he woke up, didn't know where he was, and accidentally fell out of his bed. When I opened his door, he wasn't crying because he fell out of the bed, he was crying because he was trying to get back INTO his bed and it was too tall for him to climb. He's got a shiner on his forehead from where he fell, but it only took 10 minutes of snuggling in the rocking chair for him to fall asleep again.\n\nSo, I posted a status on FB about how I felt bad that he hit his head, my poor baby, but he's ok, blah blah blah. Then I get an angry message waking me up from my husband (he's a whole other story, if you want to know, I suppose I could divulge, but it's rather lengthy) saying \"why the fuck didn't you check on him, are you really that dumb, you're the worst mother ever, I can't believe you let him cry like that, that's abuse, I'm calling CPS.\" When I tried to explain myself, he would not listen. He kept saying, \"What if he broke his arm, blah blah blah\" and he would not accept my reasoning that I know which cry is which, and he was clearly whimpering when I got in the shower, NOT crying in pain. I know the difference. His retort was, \"whatever, you're dumb, don't talk to me.\" So he started ignoring me, and didn't even respond to my suggestion that we skype so that he could see with his own eyes that his son was perfectly fine. \n\nSo, it's ruined my whole day. I've been fighting back tears and trying not to feel horrible. I already feel bad that I let him cry for so long, but now I'm being called an abuser? And I wasn't even given the chance to defend or explain myself, either. Did I do anything wrong? I mean, if I seriously did do something wrong, then please tell me. I'm not perfect, and I would want to know if I can be a better mom. It really hurts me that people would go gossiping behind my back, and that gossip could reach my husband who is thousands of miles away.\n\nI deleted the status on FB, made another status asking people to come to me if they have a problem, and cleaned out my friends list of anyone who I think would start drama. I also changed my privacy settings so that only certain people can see my posts, and I will be more careful of what I post. If something so little can be taken out of context and blown up to this, I don't even want to have a facebook account anymore.\n\nIf you've been through this, I could sure use your help. Whether your words are kind or harsh does not matter, I just need perspective.",

Surely every mother sees the advantage of having a simple heel-prick test after birth to check for easily cured conditions or jaundice etc? Not to mention vaccines?\n\nEdit: I must stress, I am not talking about home births, I have nothing against home births provided there are medical personnel there in case something bad happens and there is a hospital feasibly-nearby.

I have healed up perfectly, with no issues around bladder or bowel control, but am afraid of delivering my second vaginally as I don't want to tear again. Has anyone else out there been in this situation? If so, what did you decide for your second delivery? I was told that I have no greater risk of tearing than a first time mum, and that I could deliver vaginally, but I'm pretty tempted to have an elective cesarean second time around...\n\nEdit: thanks everyone for your thoughts and experiences. There are other factors that had me considering my options but the tear was the major one. It's great to read so many stories of good experiences following bad. ",

            "selftext": "Please help me out.\n\nI have a 15 month old boy, and breastfeeding is going fine. My problem is with **disciplining him, and getting time for myself.**\n\nHe does not like solids much, as he knows that he will get breast milk any time. But not having solids makes him hungry and cranky, and I cannot afford to have him at the breast all the time. I don\u2019t wear him, as I have a bad back. \n\nHe is very clingy, and he wakes up the moment I do, and needs to be carried around after that. Our mornings are a rush, so it is hard to get things done while carrying a big baby around. I pee, poo and brush while holding him and nursing him and that makes him slightly better while saving me time. But I need to cook and pack food too, and I can\u2019t hold him when I do.\n\nHe goes to a daycare from 9 to 6, which is good for my sanity. But the moment I pick him up at 6 PM, he cries for boob, so I nurse him in the car. I suspect that fills him up, so he doesn\u2019t want to eat dinner at all, gets angry and throws food around, till I give up n nurse him. But he nurses for ages, and sometimes he doesn\u2019t fall asleep, so the half hour or one and a half hours I spent awake in bed doing nothing were a waste. \n\nI realized that I can\u2019t have even a little bit of chocolate, or his sleep is affected. Coffee seems okay, the effects do not last as long as for chocolate. I need to throw out the granola bars that I bought without knowing they had chocolate \u2013 it is too tempting to have it if it is in sight.\n\nSometimes I make him sleep and change my shirt, and put my old shirt near him. This way I can go finish my task without him waking up. I go in and periodically swap my shirt so that he can still smell me near him.\nMy questions:\n\n\n2.\t**How do I make mealtime easier?** He eats well at the daycare.  Yesterday I drove back home from daycare without nursing him in the car, and he cried murder for a few minutes, and was fine. And we distracted him by taking him to the park afterward, so he was hungry enough at dinner time. I doubt we can take him to the park every day, especially with the crazy weather in my place.\n\n1.\t**How do I make nap times easier?** How can we get him to sleep if I am not around to nurse him? My family is pressuring me to stop breastfeeding since my life now revolves around nursing him, and also since by not sleep training him, I am inconveniencing the rest of my family who have to step in and help. He sleeps at the daycare, because the lady is kind enough to make him sleep on her shoulder, and she\u2019s experienced enough to make it work. In the last two weeks she could transition him from her shoulder to her bed near her, but not to his nap mat. My family has not been able to do it.\n\n3.\tHe is basically clingy because my parents left a fortnight back, and he went nuts at home cause he was always surrounded by people and now there was only me. So he is still clingy and cries when I leave him at the daycare, and cries at home if I am doing something else. **How do Imake him feel more secure?**\n\n4.\tUnrelated to breastfeeding: The daycare provider mixes honey and lemons in his water, to make him drink more water. It is as sweet as lemonade. Should I ask her to dilute it further? I**\u2019m concerned about him having sweets**, but thought honey is good since it is natural, but I\u2019d like it to be in moderation too.\n\n\n\n\n----\n\nUpdate: since he came down with a fever on Friday evening, I've been nursing him kinda non stop and giving him lots of attention. He still is cranky in the morning (and through the night, thats a new problem but hopefully is temporary), but otherwise he's fine, and loving the attention. He even was comfortable to leave my side and go play in the daycare, when I left him. Usually he clings to my side and cries when I leave. I think the loads of attention did go him good for once. I'm going to incorporate all your suggestions in the future. Thanks!\n",

Then I get frustrated and even the little things get to me way more than they should. Time to get dressed? its a battle, time to put your shoes on? its a battle, Time to eat? its a battle, literally everything is a battle. Some days I feel like I can't do it anymore! I try giving him notice like \"I know you're watching nemo right now, when it's over we have to get in the bath\" and he said \"okay\" but when it comes time it's a huge battle of him yelling \"NO\" then crying, etc. In the morning before work I give him a 15 minute warning \"We need to get our shoes and coats on in 15 minutes\" and he says \"okay\" then when it's time it's a huge battle. Then I end up getting frustrated and yelling. I feel like all I do is yell! I feel like we're not even enjoying our time together bc it's constant fighting and I want to enjoy our time together. Does anyone have any suggestions?\n\nA littel extra info that might help, his father isn't in the picture so I can't get out for a while and leave him home. I live with my parents right now (that's hopefully changing in the next 6 months) and they \"help\" but it's only if I want to go out after he is in bed. I've tried getting away and having my mom watch him for a few hours but when I get back all I get is crap from her about how bad he was, etc. So I don't know what else do to at this point. ANY help is appreciated!!! \n\nEdit: I've gotten so much good advice here! Thank so all so much for your kind words and for not making me feel like a failure! I was really nervous to post this because I didn't want people to be rude and make me feel worse than I already did, but you ladies gave me so many good ideas! I also have a lot of reading to do now!!! ",

He came to the delivery (and frowned like it was the worst thing to ever happen to him) and saw him maybe 3 times after that. Out of fucking nowhere (pardon my French) he decides he wants to be a part of his life again. Not just part of his life, but in essence take him from me. He took me to court, he lost that battle, but got every other weekend (per my request)\n\nNow, this morning, he is coming to pick him up. Last night I had to tell him what formula to buy, what size diapers he wears, etc etc, because he still hadn't asked about it the night before he is supposed to take him.\n\nHe has never cared for an infant before. When I asked him how to wash a bottle, give him a bath, mix and make formula he said \"well, Ill figure it out\" Not to mention, my son is ill. He is so clogged up that he is having trouble eating and sleeping. I am giving him albuterol (sp?) a few times a day, prescribed by his doctor.\n\nI asked him to please come up for a few days before the first weekend so he could get to know my baby's routine and learn how to care for him. He said no.\n\nI got a doctors note from his pediatrician saying it would be a bad idea for his father to take him for the weekend considering he is ill and he has never been away from me before, and that taking him away from me while he was ill would be detrimental to his mental and physical health. I asked his father if he would rather just come up and spend the weekend at my home and visit instead of taking him two hours away from me when he was sick. he refused.\n\nI am so scared of for the well being of my child. He has no idea how to care for him- none at all. My poor boy is so sick that he is going into coughing fits where I have to turn him over on my legs and smack his back.\n\nAnyone have anything to say that might help calm me down? :/",

            "selftext": "Setting the scene:\n\nI have a bad genetic health condition that makes me quite frail, and in mid December, I threw out my back badly. First my husband took off time to help, then my mom came up for a week, and then his mom, who's retired, came up for over a month, all to help with my son, and give me time to recover.\n\nThat was... difficult, to say the least, but I at least expected my son to be safe. She's insanely paranoid about everything - you know the type. Always bundled up, even if he's sweating, freaking out if he so much as touches a power cord. Drove me nuts, but I trusted her.\n\nAnd...\n\nI've been giving my son this liquid yogurt stuff in a sippy cup for some time now. But, I learned an age ago, it's damned hard to clean if it goes even a day without cleaning. So I had a system. I had 1 designated sippy cup for yogurt, cleaned immediately after use, 1 sippy cup for juice, a little less stringently cleaned, and the rest were water only. If the juice or yogurt sippy cups couldn't be found, he just didn't get any.\n\nWhen my back went out, I warned each of them, in order (hubby, mom, MIL), about the yogurt, about how hard the sippy cups are to clean, and how important it is to take the valve out *every time* in order to clean them. They all agreed like I was talking about the obvious, so I was satisfied.\n\nI've not been able to clean the cups in 3 months. His mom's gone, and I'm finally getting back on my feet. My son and husband have been getting sick a lot this last month, but I figured something was probably going around at his work. I've only just gotten back to mine.\n\nSo late last night:\n\nI got up to soothe the little man during his nightly crying bouts, and I noticed his crib sippy cup was almost out of water, so I decided to refill him another one, and swap out.\n\nAs was my usual practice from those months ago, I pulled off the lid and valve to check inside before filling it...\n\nBlack mold. OMG. Next one.\n\nThe same. Forgive my yelling, but, *EVERY SIPPY CUP IN THE HOUSE HAD BLACK MOLD IN THE VALVES*. One of them had a thick crust of yogurt inside the nipple! I slipped into his room and stole his sippy cup, afraid of what I'd see, but hoping at least it was okay. Nope, it had a huge chunk of black in it! That one was so thick, it was a colony a full cm across!\n\nI almost broke down crying. My husband likes to \"Demonstrate\" to my son how to drink from the sippy cup, to encourage him to drink more... that must be why he's been getting sick. Why my son's been pretty much perpetually sick for a month.\n\nI spent the next two hours, nevermind that it was the middle of the night, boiling and steaming the damned things, trying to get rid of the black mold. I got one - just *one*, of seven of them - satisfactorily cleaned, but the rest, 2 hours of intensive work couldn't get rid of the black stuff. The valves are too small to clean out with a brush/sponse, it's soaking/treatment + rinsing only. Though I resorted to chopsticks...\n\nHis stupid, paranoid, overprotective, practically abusive, she's so obsessive and pushy, mom... she freaking blew me off! She ignored my system, and failed to clean the sippy cups, despite my initial warning, and later protests (for instance, she would keep the leftover yogurt in the sippy cup in the fridge for up to a day, to prevent food wastage, whereas with me, if he didn't finish it within an hour, it was dumped and cleaned. We had a talk about that and she *promised* me that she was being very careful to clean them)\n\nI'm thinking of dumping all the damned sippy cups and replacing them entirely. I don't know if I can trust them, after being that slime encrusted and hard to clean...\n\nI know you guys will know my pain. Just thought I'd share. I'm glad his mom's not staying with us right now, because getting arrested for first degree murder would probably not help our situation.\n\n**TL;DR** My MIL ignored my warnings about how critically important it is to clean the sippy cups before they get hard to clean, while they were up here helping me recover from a back injury. Three months later, I discover black mold in all of my son's sippy cups.\n\nEdit: For note, while my husband did, admittedly, fail to closely examine the nozzles and valves, he did resume the system, and did resume cleaning out the sippy cups after every use. If they hadn't already been thick with mold, so thick that a soak and rinse apparently does nothing, there would be no problem.\n\n**Edit**: The original post also added my mother in the blame. But I really have no reason to believe she was responsible at all - she left as soon as my MIL arrived, about 6 weeks ago, and the boys didn't start getting sick till about a week after my MIL got here.",

It took me a few days to really get rallied up about this, but its so unfair. I tried breast-feeding and I couldn't.

I am in a bit of a rush (like, I *need* to get pregnant in the next seven months or major life changes will make another baby a really bad idea until 2016).\n\nAnyway, I have read a lot and it seems that women's cycles return at any time regardless of nursing. It seems that some women just have their cycle back early while others don't. So this question is for those who don't or didn't. \n\nIf you went a year without a post partum period due to nursing, when and how did your fertility return? ",

Went to bed around 8:30 with son (he's 5 months old - 2 months preemie, so he's 3 months corrected). He wouldn't get to sleep. Finally when he did, I couldn't. Usually he'll wake up to eat, then go right back to sleep, but not this night. He woke up 4 more times, I fed him, he fussed and fussed then finally went back to sleep. \nAround 6:30 my 4 year old son came into our bed which isn't unusual because he gets itchy from eczema. baby was fussing a little bit but I knew with snuggles he'd be fine. I asked hubby to snuggle him and he got frustrated and said \"I have to be up in an hour!\" I said \"I have to be up in 2 hours and you've slept all night, I haven't\". he snapped \"I don't care if you don't sleep! I have to work!\" I said \"oh gee, thanks.\" and rolled over to 4 year old, leaving baby with him. Baby kept fussing and hubby snapped again that he needed to feed. I didn't think so but I nursed him a bit anyways and gave him back. he kept fussing. Hubby asked if I gave him both sides, I said no, he's not hungry. Baby kept fussing, hubby AGAIN snaps \"Why is he doing this\"? I said he's been doing it all night, he just needs to be held and maybe rocked. \"Did you ever think that's maybe because he's HUNGRY?!?!?!\" \nSo I got mad and took baby back, put him on my arm, rubbed his cheek and he went to sleep in about 10 minutes. Meanwhile 4 year old is whining for hugs and hubby is snoring. Hubby gets up at 7:30, I sleep for a half hour and the boys wake up.\n\nSo, I got about 5 hours of sleep last night - if that - and hubby got about 9, and he \"doesn't care\".\nFML",

Her dad disagreed and tried to rush her back to her bed. I tried explaining that as parents, our kid is going to want to sleep close to us sometimes. That she might be scared. We could let her fall asleep with us and lay her down back in her own room if he had a big problem with it. Or that I could go cuddle with her in her room until she goes to sleep, and sneak out. Either way, I wasn't going to shut her into her room crying (she's normally a really good sleeper!) and possibly scared. He said, 'whatever' and went downstairs to sleep on the couch and I went to cuddle with my daughter in her room until she fell asleep. I fell asleep for a bit too. Our huge bed was completely empty for a good part of the night. And that seems wrong.\n\nWhat's happened? How can someone not want to comfort their kid, or allow the mom to? I can see how, this could be a problem if she asked everynight but she hasn't ever, even once, before this. Did I do something wrong? I mean, I did what I felt right doing. Idk.\n\nUpdate2: A few things first: Thanks for all the helpful replies! Really appreciated right now. Not sure where everyone's getting that he's sleep deprived. We were just going to bed, it wasn't in the middle of the night. There was no fatigue or sleep deprivation to dismiss everything on. It was maybe 11pm. If you think there may be something I left out--ask me about it! Unless I record conversations, I'm sorry but I can't share them word-for-word. *I* was sleepy and cranky (new diet) and still managed to list options and be tirelessly diplomatic. Regarding whether or not he was upset because I was neglecting him, I'd like to say that's most definitely not the case. Overall, I felt like I suddenly had two kids and woke up wondering what happened to my husband.\nI posted this so that I can get outside opinions on a snapshot of how we behave. Ofcourse, other things have happened that are of more consequence than this and continue to do so. I know that, someday, I may have a big decision to make that I'm not looking forward to.\nI talked to him about all this and it seems he was trying to make a stand against this becoming routine (she and I had taken a nap together in mommy's room a few days before) and he felt that she would've been 'fine' and that I should've let him put her back to bed. He went downstairs so that he could be 'out of the way'. And then we managed to start another argument when he said that he was already upset at me because I've started a new diet that 'limits' the rest of the family (buying my own foodstuffs with my own pay- there's been no toll on him or our daughter save for there's a hell of alot more bread in the house.)\nThings aren't peachy-keen now by any measure, but life goes on.\nNow, I'm wondering if I saw a cuddling opportunity and just wouldn't let go of it. :3 Idk. I guess, If my daughter needs me, is crying, and screaming for me like she was, I'm going to be there one way or another. He can choose to cuddle with us, or not. There's nothing I can do about that.",

In highschool &amp; university, sometimes I'd be nicknamed *Little*-FerretPantaloons (sigh, I'm short). In elementary school I don't really remember - though likely there was 1 other FerretPantaloons in some of my classes.\n\nIf you picked a top 5 or top 10 name, how many same-named kids are you running into? Does it bother your child at all? \n\nEdit: It's neat to hear all your stories! Quite a spectrum. Good points to have backup nicknames or middle names...\n\n**I'd like to know more about your kids' names recently - are common names still an issue?** Not too many people mention their kids below, but mention their own - is it 'cause most people skip common names now?\nThanks!",

            "selftext": "I desperately need your help, r/Mommit . . . I'm sobbing as I write this. I apologize in advance for the length (I want to give you all the details) and lack of fluency (I'm so sleep deprived I can no longer think straight.) \n\nMy baby girl is just shy of 6 months old. She has never been a  \"good\" sleeper. At 6-8 weeks she had a few 4 hour stretches (in a swing), but since then the longest stretch she has slept is 2-1/2 hours (rare). \n\nOn a nightly basis, she wakes up crying anywhere from 8 to 24 (yes 24) times, with the average being 12-16 times. She almost always requires nursing to go back to sleep for 2-10 minutes. Lately, around 2 a.m., she wakes up and is UP (not crying, just awake) for 1-1/2 to 3 hours!\n\nShe will only sleep in her travel system. I have had no luck getting her to sleep longer than a few minutes in her crib. I tried cosleeping for the first few months, but it was no better, and my husband never got any sleep. She and I have moved to the nursery with me on a cot next to her travel system.\n\nI read No Cry Sleep Solution and implemented many of the strategies but she just wakes up too many times to put a sleep plan in place. I would literally have to be up all night long. I really, really don't want to let her CIO. I've tried the attended CIO for a few hours and I just couldn't take it. She has a bedtime routine and a \"lovey.\" She goes down around the same time every night (7-7:30) and wakes herself up around the same time every morning (6-7, sometimes 7:30 if she's up for that 3-hour stretch). I put her down for naps as soon as she's tired. She had a problem taking longer than 30 minute naps, but I've been sitting in on  part of the naps and rocking her stroller through the transitions, so she's beginning to nap longer but with no improvement in the night wakings. I have read and read and read and have never found a description of a baby waking this frequently, which makes me feel even more alone and upset. \n\nWe tried having dad respond to her crying, but he didn't handle it well and he has to work early. We have NO ONE else to help; neither of us has family involved in our lives or friends in a position to help, and she cries when a stranger comes near her. \n\nShe is EBF and only just now is beginning to accept a bottle, but will only eat an ounce or so over a couple hours and then demands to be nursed. I'm beginning to really hate nursing and am considering switching to breastmilk in a bottle to see if that will help. I'm considering starting rice cereal before bed (as various people have been pushing for months but her doctor said not to do). \n\nShe has no symptoms of reflux. She doesn't seem to have a belly ache. I don't consume gluten or dairy. She is happy during the day (except for the tiredness, of course.) \n\nI feel like I'm going to go insane. I'm so tired. I miss my husband. I miss my bed. I want to enjoy my baby (and my other children). There seems to be no end in sight. I don't know what to do, but I can't keep doing this. I sometimes feel resentful and angry towards my beautiful baby (though I know it is obviously not her fault.) Between night sleeping and naps, my whole life is consumed by these sleep issues. \n\nHow do I get her to sleep outside the stroller? How do I get her to sleep longer? How can I get my life back without making her suffer?\n\n**TL;DR -- My 6-month-old wakes up 8-24 times a night including a long stretch, will only sleep in her travel system, and I am losing my mind (and straining my marriage). :(**\n\n*Edit: Bold TL;DR\n\n**Edit: Thank you sooo much for all the ideas and responses; you are all so thoughtful! I am overwhelmed by all the support. I think that I needed to hear that this isn't a \"normal\" consequence of breastfeeding and attentive parenting, and I really appreciate all the strategies you have given me to try. I will keep you updated!**",

However, I just found out that the family doesn't vaccinate their children. \n\nMy initial response is that I don't want to have them in close contact with my daughter due to this- but is that good science? They're not vaccinated, does having them in contact with my daughter put her at greater risk? I'm having trouble thinking my way through it. She'll only be 3 months old, so she won't have had a full course of vaccines yet anyway.\n\nI'm doing googling now, but I'd appreciate any insight any of you have into this. \n\nEDIT: Based on my research and the responses, I think I'll say I'm not comfortable having them around her until she's finished her infant schedule. Its a bummer because they are great kids and would be great for her. Thanks for the responses everyone, and for largely staying polite. ",

            "selftext": "I am reposting this into this subreddit in hopes of potentially finding some responders; it was difficult to write, and I would really appreciate some feedback:\nThis is something that is rather difficult for me to talk about, but I am really hoping that the women of reddit will be willing to discuss this topic with me, and I figure it's anonymous so...it's really the only way I would ever feel comfortable talking about this subject. I am doubly interested in the opinions of women who are also mothers, or interested in being mothers, especially any mothers that may have gone through something similar with their young boys. Well...I don't want to get too graphic unless there is some interest shown, and people feel the details are necessary for more context. But basically, I had a very, very uncomfortable relationship with testicle checks as a young boy. I felt extremely private, I was very shy, and on top of that my testicles are extremely sensitive (but there is nothing explicitly wrong with them apparently, except they have an a slightly higher concentration of nerves than your average male). Any time a doctor would bring it up, or my mother, I would bolt out of the doctor's office and literally run a mile away, or just refuse to go to the doctor altogether. For the most part my mother was understanding, but not in a very \"kind\" way. I would be harshly punished and yelled at usually, but at least she would end up signing me out of the exams. Well, until one day she decided that it was time to be firm I guess. She actually went through the trouble of hiring someone to help her escort me to the doctor's office and keep me there. And...well, I had to have my first testicle check while being held down for it. After this, I guess my mom was satisfied that I at least had relatively normal equipment, and didn't really want to subject me to anymore of it, and it didn't come up too much, a few times she would ask if I was willing to have another one, but I was too freaked out to even consider it. But a few years later she felt enough time had gone by, I was older, etc... and decided to take a firm stance again. Both of these were some of the worst days of my life... the experiences were so horrible I have never been able to fully comprehend them, or how a mother could stand there and watch her son go through something like that. I really want to know if other mother's have had to do anything like this? Is it relatively common, or is this just an insane case of misfortune? =/ Articles/blogs like this one make me think it might be somewhat common: http://open.salon.com/content.php?cid=43950 I would really like to know about mother's perspectives on it, and whether you would have done essentially the same thing as my mother or not? Was it something essential, or not? I guess I am just searching for some perspective, opinions from the other side of the equation...it's taken a long time to even get the point of talking about it anonymously on the internet hah. (For age references, I was about 7 the first time, and about 12 the second time). I really appreciate anyone daring to offer their opinion up. It's an awkward subject, but a very real one to me. Thank you very much!",

It was the best decision. However, the hatred among formula is so thick, it's intimidating to feed her in public for fear of backlash. I get that breast milk is best. I understand that it's \"the perfect food\" for the Baby, but it's out of the cards for us. So why does it seem like everywhere I go, there's something or someone trying to shove it down my throat? Even some formula literature I picked up at the Dr.s office has BREAST IS BEST all over it. That seems incredibly insensitive to people who CAN'T breastfeed, not want to.

But hear me out. \n\nThe first thing I usually see is dishes left on the floor by my fiance. Or empty beer bottles, trash, etc. He leaves for work super early in the morning (like 2 am) and works til the afternoon. I get it, he works a lot. But I don't think its fair to pick up after him all the time. \n\nOk, not all the time. Maybe once a week he picks up our bedroom, but that's it. I asked him to do one chore 3 days ago, and guess who is getting ready to do that today. \n\nThe worst part is, I waste all morning cleaning and cooking. And all afternoon. I don't get to really play with the kids as much as I like. By the time I'm done with everything, I have to go to work and he gets to come home and the only thing he does is heat up the dinner I made them, change a diaper, and brush their teeth. If I work a short shift I get to come home and do this too. \n\nWe are blessed that we have family that takes the kids on weekends, takes them boating, swimming, to church, etc. Because I work 10+ hour days on the weekends and the family loves seeing them. It sucks that I never really get a day off. Either I'm taking care of the kids and then going to work, or working all day. I know I'm probably pissing off a lot of stay at home or single moms; this probably sounds like first world problems to you guys, and I'm sorry. It just makes me sad that on weekends when they're not here, he is off work but doesn't do much except see his friends and relax. Which he is entitled to do. But it would be great if he could cross a couple things off my to-do list while I'm gone. \n\nAnd like I said, I get it. He works a lot. But I do too. I am starting to feel kind of worthless. I should be able to handle all this. I did great as a single mom. But when I have someone here who should be sharing the responsibility, and isn't, I have to ask myself what I'm doing wrong and why he doesn't think I need a break. It's getting harder and harder to just get out of bed because my life is constant work, no breaks (except to browse reddit on my phone while I'm cooking or whatever), and nothing to show for it-as far as having a good time with the kids. When we talk about it he gets all mad and tells me he's tired. I'm tired too but I guess that doesn't matter. ):\n\nSorry for the wall of text. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks for reading.",

Lately, it's been getting harder and harder to get my Son back when I want him.\nstarting Oct. 23 I've been trying to get in contact with His father but he hasn't answered my texts, calls or voice mails about me picking up my Son and nor does his girlfriend. Their mother-in-law hasn't heard from them in days either. I've texted and called everyone for six days straight to no avail. I literally do not know the whereabouts of my Son or his father. I have their address which is an hour away from me and when I go and show up, nobody is home. I call from different phones but no answer. I'm terrified that something has happened and I'm upset because I feel as though I'm just overreacting. Is there some legal action I can take, or something I can do? I'm just stuck.\n\n~~UPDATE~~\n\n~~I called the police and they said because i willingly gave them to him for visitation and didn't set a return date, so apparently there is nothing they can do. It was APD though and I'm in Fulton county. Should I contact the county that my ex lives in?~~\n\n~~Update~~\n\n~~I called his Mom yesterday and pretty much lied to her saying if he didn't contact me within 24 hours, the police will put out a warrant for him on kidnapping.~~\n~~She started repeating what I was saying as if letting someone else in the room know what was going on.~~\n~~She called a bit ago saying how she is going to their house within the hour to get him to call me so I can \"call off the charge\" because they don't have the money to get him out.~~\n~~I'm waiting on the call and if it doesn't come, I'll call the police to at least do the welfare check you guys tipped me on.\nI really do appreciate the help everyone.~~\n\n***Update***\n\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/12fne8/conclusion_to_i_have_no_idea_where_my_son_is/",

            "selftext": "Hi Mommit. I'm just a few weeks from officially joining your ranks, so my concerns are starting to move from pregnancy to motherhood. I'm pretty experienced with babies and kids, and have a lot of family support- especially my mom. She'll be down the whole month of December to help me out. \n\nHowever, we're having a conflict over pacifiers. My reading and thinking has led me to the conclusion that I'd like to avoid them if possible and if not, limit their use. I plan to exclusively breastfeed, and I know that pacifiers have been associated with some difficulty getting a good pattern established. Ear infections, dental problems, etc, all seem like good reasons not to plug. \n\nI'm not judging anyone's decisions here, I know that no plan survives contact with the enemy, and I am well aware that at 3am when I haven't slept for a week that pacifier might be just what I need- but my PLAN is to not use pacifiers. I'd really like to avoid using them until breastfeeding is well established at least, and then wean her from them before she's a year old. My mother basically says I'm being silly, that pacifiers are awesome for self-soothing and giving mom a break and that the benefits outweigh the risks.\n\nTL;DR: I've read the articles and the books. What I'd really like is feedback from you. Did you use a pacifier? Is there *anyone* who didn't? What are your experiences with weaning from them? *Am* I being silly? Thanks.",

            "selftext": "I have 4 children and most of them grown up. I am more than likely the age of your mothers. \n\nTonight my 23 year old (who still lives with me because my house is huge and I would get lonely), comes home from work. I had made salmon loaf and a salad for dinner and it was ready when he came in the house. He isn't hungry. \n\nThen he says he is meeting a friend at a local market, so he leaves. Then the calls begin. He wants me to make him a corned beef and cabbage. But he doesn't want just any corned beef, he wants it from scratch. And he imagines that I can make this in the pressure cooker. \n\nCorned beef from scratch takes a week, just to brine the meat. Sadly, he knows I can make it. I don't have part of the brining ingredients on hand. He begins to call and text, asking what I need, then he gets irritated and won't answer the phone when I call him back. \n\nHe comes home from the market with $30 worth of USDA choice brisket, one head of cabbage and a bag of red potatoes. That's all. He flings the brisket on the kitchen counter and says \"do what you want with it.\" \n\nSo, I brown the brisket, cut up an onion, mince 3 cloves of garlic, and throw that in the pressure cooker with water and a package of Lipton Onion Soup mix. I cut up some potatoes for mash and set them on the stove with some water. I can hear the pressure cooker down there making its hissing noises right now. He is not going to get any food until about 10 PM, because he came back at 7:45. \n\nI am not complaining! \n\nBecause as someone that is on the other end of where you all with babies are... I love the holy living hell out of my kids. I see what all the hard work has produced. I see the kids that work hard, have gone to school, and act like sensible adult human beings. I see the kids that  they laid on my stomach after labor, that I watched take their first steps, learn new things every day, the kids that I taught to read and  forced to practice their instruments. And I finally see what all that hard work is for. \n\nI have seen them pull away gradually on their way to adulthood and it was painful at times, watching them make stupid mistakes. Bringing down the hammer on discipline. Letting them take responsibility for their actions. I have watched them become individuals. They surely didn't turn out like I expected in any way and honestly, I never tried to force them to. \n\nBut sometimes, a kid of mine wants dinner. Another kid will call me and ask me how I made that incredible pot roast or chicken. One of them will call and ask how to get out a stain from a work shirt. And I know that until my last breath, that I am always going to be there for them not only when they need me, but when they want me. \n\nBeing a parent is a 24/7, full time career. And sometimes when you are in the thick of it, you feel like you want to scream. Some days they will drive you nuts and some days they will make you so happy you want to cry. It's a kind of love that you don't know until you have it, *that* you have it. \n\nSo the next time you are walking the floor with a colicky baby, or wiping the spit up off that dress that has to be dry cleaned, that every moment with those selfish little beasts is precious. That some day you will watch your kid get a diploma. \n\nIt's over in an instant, *I swear it.* You will be so busy you won't even notice the passage of time. But every story you read to them, every dinner you made, every t-shirt you washed will become part of them, and they will still look to you for support and comfort. You won't be forgotten. So do your best, every day! \n\n\n\n",

He's not quite crawling yet but he rolls and scoots enough to get into trouble if we're not nearby. The kitchen is also really cramped, so there's not really any place to put him on the floor in there. I can put him in an exersaucer in the kitchen, but he'll get bored with that before long. Same with a high chair - I can give him some puffs to munch on but again this only holds interest for so long before he screams to get down. Keeping him restrained in something for the entire 30-45 minutes it would take me to cook just doesn't seem possible. I imagine this is just going to get more difficult as he gets more mobile.\n\nBut I figure there are plenty of moms who somehow manage to cook dinner while watching the baby...so I've come here to ask: How?!",

            "selftext": " I am so frustrated with my husband. I just don\u2019t understand him at all. He has always smoked, I knew this when I met him.  He encouraged me to smoke and I did for about five years. When we decided to try for a baby we agreed together to stop smoking and with difficulty I stopped. He said that it was harder for him because he had been smoking for longer. I said ok just do your best.  I became pregnant. He smoked all throughout the pregnancy (outside) and would even offer me cigarettes. I declined obviously.      \n    He then stopped for about four months. When he restarted I was disappointed in him but resigned to the fact that it was his life. I was breastfeeding our son but he continuously offered me cigarettes to try and get me to resume smoking. I totally accept that it is pointless to nag/ask him to stop. He gets very angry and snappy with me if I dare mention it.  \nNow here is the problem \u2013 He has no life insurance. He has been smoking 20+ a day for about 20 years and REFUSES to get life insurance. I have begged him to get insurance. I am terrified that he will get cancer and leave my 19 month old son and I with no money.  \n    This may sound selfish but I do not want to raise my child alone and in poverty, especially not in poverty. We do not live on the bread line and he could afford life insurance. I myself have a sizable policy should the worst happen to me. I tried to take out a policy for my husband but they needed the name of his doctor. He has no doctor. \n     I think you know where I am going with this. He refuses to register with a doctor and will not give me his NHS number so I have no way of signing him up. We live in England so it is not as if it will cost him anything to sign up. Last week he insinuated that if he had insurance I would have him \u201cbumped off\u201d. \n    I\u2019m fed up. Not only does he smell like an ash tray, cough all the time and leave piles of tobacco around the house he refuses to protect our sons future. What can I do? Is there any way I can insure him without access to his medical information??\n",

She's made Jude (my almost 3 year old) plenty of things.\nWell, for some GOD DAMN FUCKIN' REASON, my MIL went and told her sister that we were FOR SURE naming the new baby \"Oliver\". So, her sister went and embroidered all the things she made for him with the fucking initials \"O.J.\" (Our last name is Johnson)\n\nSo, not only does it have initials we probably aren't going to use, it's also \"O.J.\" as in O.J. Simpson. I know, call me crazy. Also- MIL says \"Well if you name him Darwin (another name we were liking) you can easily change it.\" The fuck I can! And what if I don't name him that? What if his first name is Nigel? How do you change that O to an N? (No, his name isn't really going to be Nigel, but you get my point).\n\nI love her sisters blankets and stuff, and now I'm all pissed off because it's got the wrong initials on it. A hand-made blanket and it doesn't have the right initials all because my MIL is a stupid bitch who decided to tell everyone his name is fucking Oliver.\n\nIt's like SHE wants the baby named Oliver, so she is telling everyone that his name is such. Her doing this shit is driving me crazy. I have stopped telling her names, because she keeps telling everyone and everyone is making it concrete! What the SHIT. I've told her to stop doing that, because she's only going to disappoint herself (and because it's secretly pissing me off to oblivion). Nothing is set in stone until she sees it on the Birth Certificate.\n\nExcuse my excessive swearing. I'm a little irritated.",

            "selftext": "We were in a car accident in June, my babies and I, because a young mother (she had her 7 month old in the backseat) decided her phone dropping was more important than keeping her eyes on the road. She knocked my car off the road, totaling it. \n \nMy perfect 1 year old little girl has been to hospitals, specialists, and was at one time thought to have a brain tumor because her eyes just started wandering. CT scans are heartbreaking, especially when they had to give her enough propofol to knock out an elephant.  \n\nI couldn't pick up my babies for about a week because of my back and neck injuries. Could you even imagine not being able to hold your babies because of physical pain caused by someone's stupidity? My husband lost so many work hours, and I couldn't take pain pills because I had to take care of the kids when he finally did go back to work. It was agonizing when my back would spasm and shake from picking up my children. \n\nMy daughter's eyes will never be the same from the trauma of taking the brunt of the impact. (her car hit my daughters door) The eye specialist said she will have to do vision therapy, glasses, and eye patches. All of that is hard to do with a 2 year old, and very expensive to the grand total of $635 for 2 pairs. \n\nThis is just a rant as sometimes I wanna break down and cry still, but please, please, please....always pay attention while driving. Yes, no serious injuries happened, but it is heart wrenching to know my baby may need surgery to fix her eyes down the road.  She used to be so outgoing before the accident, now she refuses to potty train, (before she was going on the potty) her talking is very minimal, (about 10 words for a 25 month old) and she is afraid to go to new places. Any dr appointment is a break down.  \n\nI just wanted to say that because of something as ridiculous as picking up a phone while driving,  my Eviee is no longer the same. \n\nPlease pay attention to the road while driving. Everything else can wait......really. \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/oDe6r.jpg",
