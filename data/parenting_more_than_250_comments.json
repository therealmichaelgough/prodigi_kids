            "selftext": "I became a stay at home mom when my kids were born nine and ten years ago. I'd always thought that I would return to work once my kids were school age. Actually, I was desperate to return to work and feel like a normal adult, doing normal adult stuff around other working adults. I thought things would be so much easier now that my kids had turned 9 &amp; 10 years old. But that was not the case. \n\nBefore I started working, the house was always clean, the laundry always done and put away, the fridge always full of food, meals were always cooked in the house, kids had packed lunches everyday, and financing was in order with bills always paid on time. If kids got sick at school, it was no big deal because I could swoop in and within 5 minutes pick them up. If the kids wanted me to volunteer at one of their school activities, I was always there. Life had a rhythm that our household had gotten used to.\n\nAfter getting hired full time, I hated it! Things became crazy around the house. Everything turned to shit. I was struggling and stressed trying to keep up with everything. We started getting fast food and take out often because I was not always up to grocery shopping and cooking. The laundry pile was now a permanent thing because I just couldn't keep up with it. Every morning we were digging in the pile of wrinkly clothes trying to find something to wear. Within my first week of work my daughter had gotten sick at school. It was difficult for me to leave work early because I had just started a few days prior and my husband has a really high demanding job, which also makes it difficult for him.\n\nIt quickly became clear, working outside the house for me was just not worth it and I quit. I was only earning $12/hour which was not a big loss for us because my husband makes exponentially a lot more.\n\nHowever, not working comes with its own set of anxieties and judgments at this stage of parenting. What will I do when my kids graduate high-school, will I be employable after not working for so long? When I speak with other parents who also have older kids I could feel their judgment by the questions they ask. I live in a blue collar neighborhood where it is common for both parents to work to maintain the household. Some parents cannot understand why I wouldn't work since my kids are older. Me and my husband have always made the choice to live bellow our means with a smaller and affordable house in order to have some financial freedom.\n\nIt has gotten to a point that I am embarrassed to say that I am a stay at home mom to older kids. My family has made comments to me about \"living the good life\" and not working. I hate the judgment and it makes me stay away. I would love to hear from other stay at home parents.\n\nAnd one last thing, I have to say is that I have mad respect for working parents.",

            "selftext": "I need some advice Reddit, my son's grandparents have proposed that they take him to America for a NASA space camp (5 days 6 nights fully supervised) then Disneyworld for 3 days. Including travel, he'd be away for 2 weeks. We live in Australia.\n\nSon's father is fully on board with the idea, his thought process is this is a once in a lifetime opportunity. Grandad has been diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's - no symptoms as yet but he has been told it will happen eventually so he's trying to get all the experiences he can while he can. Our son is super into space and science and any child would love Disneyworld. I can't afford to go with, and truthfully, I would never be able to take him. \n\nI however have lots of reservations. I agree logically that it would be great, he would have the time of his life! Buuut, mum brain keeps saying, what if they lose him? What about the millions of things that could go wrong and I'd be halfway across the world unable to help? Son's father and I are separated, and I selfishly don't want to lose any more time with my son (we split custody 50/50 with a week each at a time). \n\nThe grandparents are seasoned travellers, they have been pretty much everywhere in the world. We've gone abroad with them before, they are organised and think of everything. I know it's going to be great for my son. \n\nWhat would you do? I have a few weeks to decide - it's not until next year but space camp tickets sell out fast and this one is the only one to align perfectly with our school holidays. Son already has a passport and we haven't told him anything so he won't be disappointed if I don't agree to let them take him. I just have a thousand \"what ifs?\" running through my mind and I dont know what to do.",

He wouldn\u2019t say this directly out loud, but he finds every opportunity to make jabs and jokes about how I should be doing a lot more since I\u2019m home. I\u2019ll give him credit where it\u2019s due, he works a lot, he\u2019s done well for himself in his career and is sometimes stuck at the office until 8 pm. I\u2019m not the best housewife I\u2019ll admit to that, it wasn\u2019t something I ever planned on doing, but it was the best decision for our family and one made we together. \n\nMy main issue is I feel like he cuts me down and demoralizes my job as one. He\u2019ll say things like \u201ccan you pick up after yourself a little better?\u201d When I\u2019m the only one who cleans, ever. I am constantly picking up after him and trying to maintain our home while attending to our high needs 1 year old daughter. I never ask him to help with her or with the cleaning/cooking. He\u2019ll talk about how other wives bring their husbands lunch everyday, or how his sisters do this and that all while running their own home businesses. Basically he makes me feel like even more of a failure when I already feel like I can\u2019t keep up with other moms. When I was trying to explain to him how hard it\u2019s been for me to be home all year (we also live thousands of miles away from any family/friends for his job) he always finds a way to dismiss it. Just recently he asked his coworkers who both work high powered jobs in their field if staying at home or being a working mom was harder, he told me they just laughed like to even insinuate staying home was hard was ridiculous. That\u2019s their opinions and I do have a lot of respect for working moms, but I feel like he was using this to shame me and prove he\u2019s been right.\n\nLast night things really came to a head. I can\u2019t take the criticism, the lack of help , and him coming home and expecting to be left alone/not having to do anything to help me. It\u2019s a fight to even get him to take out the trash, so I just do it myself. I told him I didn\u2019t want to do this anymore and he basically said fine and alluded to divorce. I thought that was cold, I don\u2019t think he meant it but I do think we\u2019re at a crossroads. What should I do? This is my first child and I don\u2019t know if I should be doing better or not? I genuinely feel like I can\u2019t keep up with other moms no matter how hard I try but I don\u2019t know how I can change. Is he in the wrong to expect all of this but never help because he works so much? I feel alone and like a loser mom who can\u2019t get it together.",

            "selftext": "Firstly, thank you to everyone who gave heartfelt and awesome advice in my last post. I read every single comment and message.\n\nLINK: \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/cz7pie/wife_has_almost_completely_stopped_taking_care_of/\n\nUPDATE: \n\nThings were horrific for us last week. I genuinely believed that my wife was suicidal. She would talk frequently about how she wanted to die and how death was so much easier than living. It freaked me out, and rightfully so.\n\nI called my parents once and for all. I told them everything that I wrote in the post and more. They talked to her and demanded that she take the PPD medication or else they would come down to our house. Mind you, my wife\u2019s parents are not in the picture. She said that she actually WANTED my parents to come down to our house. They agreed. \n\nMy mom can be very brash, but it was effective in the end. My parents came down two days after I made The Call. They called her doctor and made an appointment for her while they watched the kids. She was prescribed more depression and anxiety medication at a higher dosage. \n\nMy wife has been taking her NEW medication for a full week now. Before anyone asks, I *make sure* that she takes it. She is 100% medicated. I can tell a clear difference already. \n\nShe is more relaxed now. It\u2019s helping tremendously. It took a day for it to kick in, but she seems healthier and happier so far. The house is cleaner and the kids are well taken care of. The weather has been nicer, and she takes the kids outside all day when I\u2019m at work. They all love it. \n\n*Some more miscellaneous things have happened:*\n\nBOTH of my kids are sleeping in their own beds. To my dismay, neither child fought sleeping in their own room that they share. The first night was rough (late last week), but they both understand that they have to do it. Our daughter still wakes up once, but everything is so much better at night! I love that we have our bed back. \n\nMy parents paid for my wife to have her nails and hair done. They also watched the kids so she could have an entire day off. \n\nMy parents bought the kids tons of new toys and books. This helps because they\u2019ve been more entertained while my wife recovers. \n\nMy parents arranged for my wife to see a therapist once a week. They are paying for it, and her appointments are after I get home from work. Her first appointment is tomorrow. \n\nMy parents have left, but they\u2019re in contact every single day. My wife is embarrassed, but she says that she feels better. It\u2019s only been a week, and I don\u2019t know what the future holds. \n\nI think that\u2019s it. Please no negative comments. I don\u2019t know if this is the \u201cperfect solution\u201d that everyone will agree with. This is what has happened. It\u2019s a daily battle. We will get through it. My wife knows that my parents and I will always love and support her. \n\nAlso, keep in mind that it\u2019s only been a week! Progress has been made and is being made.",

            "selftext": "My daughter is in 8th grade and her school is holding a fundraiser. It's facilitated by an outside company. The kids would sell products to family, or door to door, to raise money for the school. Selling earns them points, which they can redeem for prizes. \n\nMy daughter was super excited about this, mainly because of the prizes. But I had my concerns. I told her she could participate only if she sat down with me and did the math to know what she was getting into. As one should at the start of any new business venture. She agreed.\n\nWe found statistics on how long it takes to make a successful door-to-door sale. She also asked some of her older school friends how long it took them to make the average sale. \n\nThen, we did some research on how much the company takes, compared to how much goes to the school. Shockingly, about 48%\n\nThen we figured how many points are made per dollar of sales. And found a way to equate points to USD by finding the prizes sold online, and coming up with an approx. dollar value of a point.\n\nThen a bit of number crunching, and we figured out a few things:\n\nHer time was valued at under a dollar an hour. (considering how long it takes to make a sale, how many points she earns, and how many dollars a point is worth)\n\nAnd if she raised $100, we estimated the school would get $52, the company  would get $44 and her prize would be about $4 worth. She thought that was unfair the school wasn't getting more even though that's what the fundraiser was for. And that her \"pay\"would be so little.\n\nI told her that her time and her labor is valuable, she shouldn't have to accept working without fair pay. It's up to her what she considers fair.\n\nAnd she was honestly blown away by how unfair things were; she asked me if I'd send her the Excel sheet we did the math in to show her friends. And include the links to our sources. She took it to school, and I was proud of her. She's always been the type to complain \"when am I ever going to use this\" about math, so it was amazing seeing her understanding applied math and explaining it to her friends. \n\nA few days later, I got a call from one of her teacher, saying a spreadsheet criticizing the fundraiser, and a set of links to the rewards on Amazon were being passed around the entire grade. And the teachers had traced it back to my daughter trying to convince people to not participate. Plus, a bunch of kids were getting the reward toys on Amazon, undermining the rewards system for everyone. She said I was overstepping, and my daughter was disrupting school.\n\nI have a meeting with the school this Friday, and I want to stand by the fact that these kids do deserve to be able to make informed decisions. But I'm also worried I would be overstepping; I only meant this as a lesson to my daughter and never meant for it to spread to the whole grade.\n\nTLDR - I need advice on how to approach the fundraiser meeting",

            "selftext": "My son got accepted into a stellar university. It was his second choice. He got accepted into his first choice but picked this one instead even though the other had a better program for his major. It worked out to be the same price so we didn't mind. The only thing that concerned us was the fact that this school is so close to our home. Freshman have to live on campus but we didn't want him coming home often. I love my son but he needs to gain some independence. \n\nHe started classes 2 weeks ago yesterday. Since then he has been home 10 days. He comes home on Friday to sleep over until Sunday and hangs out after classes on Mondays and Thursdays. I'm worried he's not getting the college experience. They had a club fair over the weekend and he refused to go. He doesn't want to do any clubs which isn't shocking since he didn't in high school either. He mostly comes home and plays video games. He says he prefers being at home but we want him to fly on his own. \n\nOver this last weekend I told him that we are happy to see him but we don't want him coming by so often. Maybe we can continue ones during the week and having him come home on Saturday and sleeping over until Sunday but we can't have him here. He got really upset and said we are being unreasonable. He does do chores around the house but no more than his younger brother. My daughter is a sophomore in college and I know the freshman transition can be hard. My daughter was a plane ride away and drop off was awful. She cried and cried and cried. She called us a few nights out of the week and spent a lot of time with a high school friend who landed at the same university. She eventually found her way but I think not coming home made that easier. She couldn't come home so she didn't have that safety net. This year she flew down on her own. We still text a lot but she's got her own thing going. I'm worried my son isn't going to get to that level. He's always been immature and dependent on us. I know you can't compare siblings but he's behind his 16 year old brother in that department. I don't think the extra coddling is helpful but I don't want to be too harsh.",

I have no idea what she did with the other kids, but she called Jane out of class repeatedly.\n\nHer one solution was to never put them in the same classroom. Brilliant. I'll take it. \n\nAll year, we promised Jane, \"just stick it out and next year will be better. I promise.\"  She'd come home crying, and I'd assure her the principal was going to handle it. Etc.\n\nThis year rolls around, and Mia (and her #1 bully friend) is in her class.\n\nJane says it's fine. Jane has offered compliments to Mia, but Mia will not speak a word to her.\n\nOUTCOME: nearly every morning, Jane is struggling to get dressed. She wants to wear the same outfit every single day. She hides in her closet, crying. This is all brand new behavior. She's almost 9yo. I think this all goes back to Mia.\n\nI believe that mias presence is fucking her up. Shes not making new friends.  She's acting very strange - like, making weird sounds\n\nI called principal and she admitted her mistake and then offered to give Jane one-on-one training on how not to get fixated on one person.\n\nShouldnt Mia be the one getting some training?\n\nEvery day at recess, Jane seeks out her twin sister and plays with her.  :/\n\nTl:Dr daughter was bullied very badly last year. Principal promised they would not be in the same classroom. They are.\n\nDaughter is acting strange every morning when she gets dressed  (crying every morning, making bizarre noises. Hiding in closet. Wants to wear the EXACT same clothes every day of the week.)\n\nWhat do I do? Even if Mia doesn't \"bully\" her this year, I believe her presence is enough is causing a lot of anxiety for my kid.\n\nWwyd?",

I said that they are both allowed to use the big screen TV and DVD player in the living room but that he had to leave by 10pm as we have a huge family function tomorrow. I said there will be no cooking of any meals as last time they both trashed the house making breakfast in the middle of the day and I had to send him home.\n\nAs soon as he came over, she changed. She started to show off in front of him and demanded I take out ingredients for cooking. I said we discussed this and no. She pushed all the limits and asked for ice cream then her cell phone so they could watch YouTube videos. She then said she was \"mad at me\" for saying no to ice cream so she was going to eat all the cookies I worked hard to hand make.\n\nThe poor kid who walked over felt bad for me and said to please not treat me this way. She proceeded to stand in the living room (food restricted area) and shove cookies in her mouth as fast as possible.\n\nI am so embarrassed. I did not send him home as this is not his fault.\n\nShe ate every home-baked cookie in the house while mocking me. They are still downstairs watching a movie and I am trapped upstairs in my own bedroom fuming.\n\nI am thinking the worst punishment for her would be to take her phone off of her for the rest of the weekend but she will probably just throw another tantrum. She has never done anything like this and I don't want her to have friends over ever again. She is acting like a toddler. Help?",

            "selftext": "(DISCLAIMER: I'm a little irritated, so this is going to be a little bit of a rant, but shared experiences or advice is absolutely welcome)\n\nContext: We have a three year old and I'm 28 weeks pregnant with #2. \nMy husband CONSTANTLY gets irritated when he isnt able to just go lay down and take a nap randomly in the day (often without mentioning it to me at all, so I have no idea that he's trying to sleep until I go in the room and he gets mad at me for interrupting his nap.) \n\nI've tried to ask that he just let me know if he wants to take a nap to avoid that, but also because I feel like its disrespectful to just go lay down for a couple of hours and just expect me to take care of everything with our son without asking.. (I feel like he takes advantage of a me being a SAHM, so it's just expected that I'm the 'default parent' who handles everything so my husband can do whatever he wants as long he takes a little bit of time out to play with him here and there.) He gets irritated at me for wanting him to \"Ask for permission\" anytime he wants a nap. He also has a habit of going into the bedroom and laying down to go to sleep while I'm handling dinner for our son, leaving me with dinner cleanup and the whole bedtime routine alone, again without saying anything at all so I dont realize it until I bring my son into the room to get ready for bedtime and dad is snoring. (He doesnt like to say anything to me because I'll get irritated at being left to handle everything alone...again, so I guess it's just easier to avoid the conversation entirely?)\n\nIn the mornings, especially on weekends, I'm expected to get up with our son and get him out of the room so that dad can sleep in. He'll get irritated if I dont, or if our son wakes up and is ready to get up and I dont get up and take him, his dad will just give him Youtube on his phone to keep him occupied and in the room so that he doesnt have to get up and do anything. He doesnt get out of bed until at least 9, sometimes closer to 10-10:30am. I've asked if he can get up and let me sleep in sometimes, but it doesnt happen. If you ask him, he \"does everything\" around the house and for our son, and I just need to understand that he works full time and is tired, or his back hurts, etc.. (Can I reiterate that I'm pregnant and due in November??.. Plus I've been having pelvic pain that makes it difficult to walk at times, which my doctor says is normal and we cant do anything about it.) \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI'm just extremely irritated. I'm about to have baby #2, and despite me asking since April, my husband has not taken any steps to start getting our son used to going to bed for him, so if I'm not in the room for bedtime, he wont go to sleep. I tried leaving the house and making my husband take care of bedtime, but when I came home, my son was still crying because he isnt used to me not being there. When this baby comes, I dont know how I'm going to handle everything on my own, because it's becoming obvious to me that my husband doesnt care enough to make it a priority to help. I feel like his \"I should be able to lay down when I want because I'm tired\" argument is very child-like because he's acting like he doesnt have responsibilities, and completely disregarding the fact that I might be tired, too, but I have a toddler to take care of so I cant just lay down and go to sleep whenever I feel like it.\nTrying to explain how I feel or communicate at all about this hasn't helped because he legitimately believes that he's in the right and that I'm being unreasonable, so it just dissolves into arguments when I try to discuss it. I'm just at a loss, and feeling extremely undervalued and taken advantage of, and I needed to get it off my chest. \n\nIf you've made it this far, thanks for reading.",

(On mobile, sorry for formatting).\n\nI have been recovering this past week from a full episiotomy and am emotionally, physically, and mentally exhausted. My son refuses to latch and I have to spend a huge chunk of my time pumping (I don't want advice for this, it just matters for the sake of the story). \n\nMy husband has been nothing but an extra child for me. He is always on his phone and will complain about doing diapers or doing anything baby related. When the baby is fussy, he expects the pacifier to make everything better and it doesn't. \n\nNow, my husband doesn't have any experience with babies, I'll give him that. But I do my best to teach him everything I can, but he always catches an attitude about it and I noticed the way he looks at me is different now. \n\nIn the shower the other night, I just broke down sobbing. I have little to no support from him. I HAVE told him so many times how I hate that he is always on his phone (he's been on it like this for awhile). He can't stay off of it, though. I get so angry as I'm sitting in the rocking chair, trying to comfort our son, and he is just on facebook. I want someone to talk to, I want him to be there for me, but he doesn't listen. I honestly thought of breaking his phone. \n\nMy husband was so worried about me getting PPD but has done next to nothing to help me.\n\nI don't know what to do. Before advice is given, please don't tell me \"go to therapy\" or \"see a marriage counselor.\" 1. Neither of those are an option for us right now. 2. I really just want to know what you guys think is going on in his head  because he won't tell me. 3. Maybe your spouses went through something similar?",

            "selftext": "I posted this in the r/offmychest subreddit, as well, but my anxiety about it absolutely stems from being a parent. I'm not concerned about myself, I'm concerned about my kids. \n\nDenier types need not apply.\n\nI am absolutely from the school of 'Humans will figure it out'. I figure if there was ever a species to get it together and a least find a way to sustain and survive through something like extreme climate change, it's us human types.\n\nI am far from a bleeding-heart, hippie when it comes to the environment in general. I do have a life-long love of science, space, wildlife, etc. I do what I can to save energy, recycle, I bought a hybrid (un-intentionally, but I was pleased when I noticed that it was a hybrid). Every Christmas, I take a certain amount of money and donate it. The last few years have been to vetted conservation groups. In short, I do what I can, but I'm not flying down to the Amazon to haplessly throw buckets of water on the fire or stand in front of logging trucks. I'm not dying on that hill, because...well... I think we're all already on the hill that we're going to die on.\n\nIn truth, this week, with the Amazon rainforest stuff- I'm getting pretty freaked out. I'm still getting up and going to work, doing what I need to do for the right now, because part of us figuring it out is continuing to live as normally as we possibly can. I don't hide under the covers because I can't bear the reality of life. *However*, when I get home from work, there is a 2 year old girl that runs to me like she hasn't seen me in a month. In January, there will be a baby boy that I get to hold. I fear for the world that will be left to them. If there is one left at all.\n\nIn my early morning browsing, I stumbled across an article about a report that posits the decline of human civilization beginning in (at least) 2050. There are some scientists that believe it, some that don't. The concerning part isn't that they're arguing about the basis of the report, it's that they're arguing about the numbers of people that it will impact.\n\nIt really is unfortunate.",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone.  This is my first official post on Reddit.  I\u2019m on my phone writing this so I\u2019m sorry for any mistakes or errors.  \nI\u2019m (28F) currently a SAHM of an 8 month old boy.  He is definitely keeping me on my toes.  With staying home I always try to keep up with cleaning and try to cook a meal every other night so my husband has leftovers for work.  He helps out as well in the mornings before he leaves for work with the baby.  He usually will get up and feed him and play.  \nBut I feel like from the time my husband (27M) leaves for the gym until the time he gets home I\u2019m nonstop.  There\u2019s times where I don\u2019t eat for hours on end because I honestly am so sidetracked with what needs done or taking care of my son.  \nMy husbands career isn\u2019t easy and is stressful.  Sometimes I feel like a failure as a person and woman for staying home with my son.   I love my son and husband with all of my heart.  I love watching  my son grow.  He truly amazes me every day.  \nHowever, I feel like sometimes I\u2019m so burnt out at the end of the day.  I\u2019m feeling very guilty for staying home and not working.  We never really struggled with money until now.  I went to look at our bank account tonight and it\u2019s not good.   I immediately started crying and feel like the biggest piece of crap.  I\u2019m guilty of sometimes buying unneeded things at the stores.  \nI feel like I\u2019m not contributing in any way and it sucks.  I was working a pretty good job before the baby for 7 years.   When we looked into daycare we realized it wasn\u2019t worth it because my entire paycheck would go towards  it.\nNow I\u2019m starting to feel like did I make a mistake in staying home?\nSorry for rambling I\u2019m just beating myself up over this.  I feel like a failure and that I\u2019m not doing enough.  If anyone has any good advice or similar experiences that would be great.",

Often times she comes home and tells me stories of her mother being mean, forceful, or acting without compassion. She will tell me things like she doesn't want to go back or she only wants me to pick her up from school. And naturally she will change her tune from time to time, but regardless it bothers me.\n\nThe most recent tale is \"My mom pops my toes.\" What she means is her mom will forcefully grab each of her feet and pull on each toe to make it pop. I have seen her do this to her other children when we were together. None of them like it. They pull away and protest, but she does it anyway. In fact she laughs and thinks it's funny. My daughter being 4 years old can't really do anything when a much stronger adult grabs hold of her and yanks on her toes. I am going to speak with her mother tomorrow as we have made plans to do family stuff.\n\nIn the meantime I wanted to ask other parents. Do you think what she's doing is child abuse?",

If he complains or stalls, he will lose the day's password but still have to do the hygiene chores today to get tomorrow's password, or else he will lose wifi tomorrow. This plan was presented to him when one day, he got up and tried to play video games on his computer, but the wifi wasn't on. When he told me about it, here's what I said to him. I was brutally frank and honest:\n\n\"I changed the wifi password and logged you off because of your poor hygiene skills. You stink, and it is annoying me and anyone else who has to come into contact with you. I know that you do not care about hygiene, but that doesn't matter. You must have good hygiene if you want to stay healthy and have good jobs and relationships. As your parent, it is my responsibility to make sure that I am teaching you important life skills, and hygiene is one of them. In order to earn your wifi for each day, you must shower, brush your teeth, use deodorant, keep your room clean, and take your dirty clothes to the laundry room. If you complain, argue, or stall about doing your hygiene responsibilities, you will lose wifi for today, but you will still need to do them to get wifi tomorrow. Your bathroom has a fluffy bath mat and a heater so you don't have to complain about being cold and wet. There is also a list of your hygiene responsibilities in your bathroom, so you don't forget anything.\"\n\nWhen I was telling him this, he rolled his eyes a few times and had the \"screw you mom\" glare on his face. So far, he's been doing his hygiene tasks all the time without being prompted, and only complained once. I also put a note on his computer that said \"No hygiene, no wifi!\" Thank you for all your suggestions on my original post, and if you're going through this problem with your own kids, make them earn something they want every day, like wifi, by doing their hygiene chores.",

Elementary school was hard but middle school was downright brutal. He's got a lot of issues with confidence, codependency, and empathy. Combine that with not liking things that most teen boys are into (sports, girls, social media, etc) and he's left out even in groups that initially accept him. We encouraged him to join clubs but haven't had much success in forming real friendships that sustain outside of school. \n\nI asked him what he wants to do for his birthday tomorrow and he said he just wants to sleep in without his siblings waking him up. I asked if he wanted to go out to dinner and he declined. He asked for us to not get him a cake either and doesn't really want his birthday acknowledged. I'm certain it's because of the lack of friends issue. \n\nWhen he was 7 and no one came to his party, we were still able to make it fun for him. I wish he was 7 again.

            "selftext": "My son turned 3 and my SO and I took him to see his pediatrician. Our son is intact. When he was a baby, our pediatrician expressed dismay for it but we blew it off because it was really hard to find a supportive doctor for an exclusively breastfed baby. Over the years, she tried giving us poor intact advice which I've never followed. I've never forced his foreskin back, just clean it like a finger. \n\nYesterday, she asked to see his penis, like at every other visit. Except she's never touched his foreskin before when he was an infant. I put him on the table, told him what we are doing. She asked if we retract. I said \"no, the skin is fused and if you retract, it'll tear.\" She asked if she can do it, I said \"no. He'll do it himself.\" I have no doubt we'll both notice when it's retracting naturally. She forcibly pulled the foreskin all the way back and then pulled it back up. I told her to stop three times. My SO told her to stop. I tried to remove my child from her and she wouldn't take her hands off of him. My son was very uncomfortable with the procedure. He arched his back and lifted his knees toward his chest. After she finished she kept spouting off about UTIs without addressing any of my concerns. \n\nI called patient relations and left a message. I filed a complaint with the state med board. I reached out to IntactAmerica. It's the evening so I'm not expecting to hear back from anyone today. But I've been sick to my stomach and I can't focus on anything else. This has never happened before and I have no idea how to respond. My son says he's not in pain, still going pee on the potty (we're potty training and I'm super happywith his progress), and happily playing with his ween. So, I'm certain he's fine. But I'm not. I'm scared of the confrontation and I'm scared no one will take me seriously. I'm scared this will be a recurring issue even if I switch pediatricians.",

            "selftext": "I lost my husband (34) 3 months ago. It was sudden, it was unexpected and it turned my whole world upside down. We have a 3 year old little girl.\n\nI am a nurse, I do shift work, that\u2019s hard with a kid, especially being single. I decided to move myself and my daughter back to my home province. I found a house a couple blocks away from my parents. My dad is retired and my mom only works part time. They are both available and not just willing, but wanting to help me with my daughter. \n\nI\u2019m really fortunate that I received a sizeable life insurance settlement. I was able to purchase our new home outright, and settle all other debts I had and have some money left over. Not having a mortgage or debts means I don\u2019t have to work full time. We can comfortably get by with me working 2-3 shifts per week, for that I am so grateful. My parents have no problem keeping my daughter while I work. It makes a lot of sense for me to move. I have given my notice at my current job, I got a nursing license for my home province, I have been applying for jobs and actually have a few interviews for when we physically move there next week. I have sold my current house, the new owners get possession August 1st.  We are doing this.\n\nMy MIL has been making my life miserable since I told them we are moving. And I get it, she just lost her son and now to her I\u2019m taking her granddaughter away. She has said things like \u201cmean mommy is taking you away from grandma, and grandma is really sad\u201d to my daughter. (She got a bit of a talking to about that, but I find it hard to be too harsh on her because she is grieving her son). She tells me I don\u2019t have to move, that she\u2019ll help with my daughter (we tried that when my daughter was one and my mat leave ended, she was supposed to watch her 2-3 times a week, the amount of sick time I burned through when she\u2019d bail was ridiculous, I ended up taking a different position). \n\nThey know I received life insurance money and have a rough idea of the amount, and she makes comments all the time- \u201cwith *that* much money you could afford to take a few years off work and just wait till she goes to school to get a job.\u201d She also makes comments about the life insurance that makes me think she\u2019s upset that he left it all to me. But that\u2019s another story.\n\nShe\u2019s just making this so hard. It\u2019s so hard for me not to snap at her. I\u2019m trying to give her grace because she is grieving. **but so am I** I lost my husband, my best friend, lover, soulmate, co-parent. It\u2019s so hard, I\u2019m trying my best to make it work, and if moving to my home province is what it takes I will do it. I\u2019m just at my wits end with my MIL. \n\nI don\u2019t want to cut her off from my daughter completely, but I also can\u2019t tolerate this. Advice please.",

            "selftext": "Forgive me it's a long one but would appreciate the time.\n\nFor the last few months I've really struggled emotionally and I feel my mental health is deteriating rapidly. \n\nParenting a two year old is honestly one of the hardest things ive ever done. I'm pretty much flying solo here because my husband doesn't live with me and he works 40 hours a week. He'll visit some nights or at the weekend. \n\nMy son and I have really got ourselves in a rut. We get up, he asks to have the TV on its a show on YouTube that he watches and it's just coloured cars going down ramps. That's it. Over and over and over and over. If I say no when he asks he goes into full meltdown mode for HOURS!  Until I put it on. He sits on that couch all damn day! When I get games out and turn the TV off he screams. He has learned how to turn it back on when I turn it off so if I turn it off he gets up and switches it back on. He plugs the TV back into the wall and turns it on. He eats on the couch because I can't get him off it. And I'm just too exhausted to even fight him. On days I feel strong I turn it off and allow him to slap the TV and scream for hours. It's a constant battle he never wants to play with or interact with me he's just a viscous zombie watching a screen.\n\nThe only way I can get him away from the TV is if I take him out for the day, but recently he has sometimes started crying when we are out to watch \"car cars\". \n\nI've hit braking point. I can't live like this anymore. He wakes up in the morning and I'm like no I can't do this. It's going to sound horrendous but he wakes up and I'm already fed up because I know he's gonna ask me at least 20 times in the first 30 minutes until I put it on. I lie in bed just feeling empty. How can this even be my life.\n\nSometimes I just stand in my kitchen just to get away from him and cry because this is not what I envisioned having a child would be like.\n\nSo yesterday I was like fuck this for a laugh I'm not doing it. I ignored his crying (he ate no breakfast because he wasn't getting his \"car cars\") I dragged his ass out of the house and decided to take him to the park. I was like 9am that's how rediculous and fed up I am. 10 minutes in he's refusing to walk and he's shouting \"mama carry me, mama carry me!\" Then I ignore him and he then switches to \"car cars, car cars, car cars, go home put car cars on\" over and over and over and over! \n\nI'm not proud. But I absolutely lost it. I started shouting \"....child's name... JUST STOP!! NO! WE ARE NOT GOING HOME TO WATCH CAR CARS! WE WATCH CAR CARS ALL DAY EVERY DAY!! I CAN'T DO IT ANYMORE! LOOK AT THIS PARK! THERE IS SWINGS AND SLIDES AND ALL YOU WANT TO DO IS WATCH TELLY!!\" \n\nHis little face just looked at me in complete shock and then he started crying harder. Then I started crying. And then he asked for a cuddle and I told him I'm sorry for shouting. I knew something had to change because I couldn't live like this anymore. I phoned my mum and she came and got us and I told her how bad things were getting and how I'm failing him as a parent.\n\nShe took him for the night so I could think about what to do next. I'm so stuck, I can't live like this anymore and I just want the best for us. Him living like that infornt of the TV is no good for him and a two year old should want to play! \n\nSo drastic decision but I don't watch TV I hardly use it so I put it away in the attic. In an attempt to save us both. I buised myself cleaning the house until he came home. I had my friends over and we played some D&amp;D and that distracted me a bit but I was dreading him coming home. Tbf I was nervous. What if he freaked out for hours and I'd have a breakdown and go get it down from the attic. Telling myself to be strong and I've got this.\n\nSo he comes strolling in about 3pm loving life, he's just come back from a swimming trip. Sure enough the first thing he does is come up to me and says \"car cars on\". So I calmly showed him where the TV used to be and said \"oh no the TV is broken baby we can't watch car cars anymore, why don't you come and play with your toys?\" With dread I took his hand and we sat down next to his bricks. Expecting a tantrum. NO SUCH TANTRUM CAME! \n\nWe sat for like half an hour like building bricks he was telling me all the colours and sharing and saying all these words I had never heard him say! It felt so amazing! We played for hours! Matching games! Reading books! WE WENT INTO THE GARDEN!!! Honestly I don't think I've ever been this happy! I'm getting to know my child again! Of course he asked once or twice but when he saw the TV was gone he quickly forgot about it and took my hand to something else.\n\nI almost cried. I got my boy back. I understand I'm not out of the woods yet. But it's a start. Tomorrow is a new day and I feel like a large rectangular weight has been lifted and I may in time start to enjoy life again.\n\nJust a offload really. any advice welcome.",

Usually I\u2019d make them play right in front of the window where I could watch him closely. \nSo one day I decide to let him play a little farther away where the other kids play football in the grass. This day his \u201cfriends\u201d poured water all over him soaking his clothes &amp; took his shoes off and threw them in the mud. I saw this when I went to go check on him after about 10 minutes. At first I thought they were just playing, until I really only my child was soaked &amp; dirty.\n\nWhen we get in the house he tells me they kept filling up water bottles and chasing him around after he told them to stop. After he asked them to stop , they pushed him in the mud and proceeded to take his shoes off when he was down and throw them in the mud too. He said they kept saying things like \u201coh we\u2019re not doing this to anyone else because we\u2019re all friends &amp; you\u2019re not\u201d. My son cried literally all night because of this incident, he was so hurt. The children apologized, but only because I asked them to.\n\nSo today they knock on the door asking if he can play. I tell them no and ask them not to knock on my door anymore. Now my son is hysterical &amp; so upset. And just doesn\u2019t understand my concern even though I\u2019ve expressed it to him. I feel horrible. But I\u2019m just concerned that the first time I let him play out of eyesight, they were mean to him.",

            "selftext": "I finally gave in after five years of, \u201cI don't need any parenting advice from strangers on the internet! I'm an amazing dad!\u201d Turns out I do need parenting advice from strangers on the internet, because right now I feel like a mediocre father at best. \n\nMy 5-year-olds are a mix of cuteness and possible demonic possession (depends on how many hours they've slept, really) but also a mix of very different nationalities. When we found out were having twins, my husband and I decided to split the naming privileges 50/50. I went for a standard male name for one twin, not super common but not super rare either. \n\nThe other twin ended up with a Russian female name that's somewhat uncommon here. The way Americans pronounce it is slightly different from how Russians pronounce it. It's not difficult to pronounce it the \"Russian way\" at all, anyone with a mouth can do it. But apparently not this woman. \n\nThe daycare both of the twins go to recently hired someone new. That was alright, no big deal. I had that mindset until I picked up my 5-year-old daughter (noticeably upset) and her brother. I asked her what was wrong, and she immediately told me:\n\n\u201cMs. [Insert 'Murican surname here] kept calling me the wrong name and got mad at me when I told her she was saying it wrong.\u201d\n\nApparently, my daughter got yelled at for \"interrupting\" the teacher and had to sit in the corner of the room for eight minutes while the other kids were painting because she told the teacher she was pronouncing her name wrong. The teacher also scolded her when she cried because of it. \n\nMy first instinct was to get out of the car and talk to the teacher, who I haven't met yet. Told my kids to wait inside. Lo and behold, there she was, cleaning up the tables after the children. I greeted her, etc. and told her what the problem was and why I was there. \n\n\"My daughter told me you got upset after she corrected you for saying her name incorrectly?\"\n\n\"Yes, I did. She was interrupting my class by making such a big show of it.\"\n\n\"How so?\" \n\n\"After I told her to answer a question, she told me mid-sentence how what I was calling her wasn't her name.\"\n\n\"And?\"\n\n\"And she asked me to pronounce it in a strange way. I don't see how me pronouncing her name differently was such a big issue. She kept correcting me so I disciplined her.\" \n\n\"But that is how her name's supposed to be pronounced. I don't see why you'd discipline her for that.\" \n\n\"Well, there isn't really a reason why it has to be pronounced a specific way. It's just a name. It doesn't really matter.\"\n\nThen I essentially told her that my daughter is a fricking 5-year-old, so her name is still very much important to her and how my husband isn't from here so we've been pronouncing her name \"the strange way\"\t her whole life so she got used to it. \n\n\"Telling an adult something they said is incorrect while they're speaking, especially if they're a teacher, is disrespectful. You're blowing this out of proportion. This is America. If your husband wanted to live here so badly, then he should've picked an American name and pronounced it the American way. Complain somewhere else if you really think that it's that important of an issue.\"\n\nOh, so disciplining a kid because of your mistake isn't disrespectful? She got back to cleaning, I got back in the car and drove home pissed. Right now I have a sad 5-year-old (she's an emotional kid who gets upset easily) who doesn't want to go to daycare anymore all because of a name. \n\nWas I really overreacting? Advice would be appreciated.",

Even just a little. Her cousin, who is only 3 months older, just started. So I knew it was very imminent. But still, I thought I had time. I mean, I started at like 12 or 13. \n\nFor weeks, I contemplated how to bring up this conversation. I grew up in a home where \"taboo\" things weren't openly discussed. Not because my parents were neglectful, I just don't think they wanted to talk about the uncomfortable stuff. Then at 14, my dad died unexpectedly and I was left with a mother who was so broken because of his death, that I didnt have ANY parents left. I got pregnant with this daughter at 16. \n\nI waited too long.\n\nAND IT STARTED WHILE WE WERE AT THE DAMN POOL. My poor baby girl started in one of the hardest ways. In a bathing suit surrounded by friends. She went on to stay the night with a friend, not saying anything to me. She said she was scared to at first. She bled all night at her friends house. \n\nThe friend's mom knew before me. She washed her bathing suit for her. Her friend said she thinks she knows what's going on. They knew before me. The next day I picked her up, and as soon as we got home she told me that blood was coming out of her. And my heart sunk. \n\nMy fear came true. I waited too long to discuss this with her, and what I wanted to prevent happened. She was terrified in her own mind for at least 24 hours because she didn't know what was happening and I failed to prepare her. When I first started telling her everything was okay, she was crying in my arms. Tears of relief, I think. I hope.\n\nMy heart is heavy with guilt, and many other emotions that are hard to name. Guilt because I failed her in this small way. Guilt because she was too scared to tell me when she first noticed. Guilt that she suffered it at a friend's house. \n\nBesides guilt, I'm dealing with whatever emotions that come with my baby growing up. I've always fantasized about my children growing into teens and adults. I've always been excited to see who they become. My friends and family are always like, \"Beware the teenager.\" But impending teenagerdom never scared me. My kids are amazing and I can't wait to give them the tools for being an adult that I never had. But this whole period thing has thrown me for a loop and now I'm feeling very sad that it has happened already. \n\nShe has a younger sister and you better bet your ass I won't wait too long with her. \n\nTLDR Tell your daughters, much sooner rather than later, they will have a period so they don't get traumatized when it actually starts.",

Prior to giving birth I have been terrified by the idea of me possibly hating motherhood (I've read a few confessions on reddit about some parents disliking being parents). When my son was born 3 weeks ago, I honestly didn't feel an immediate bond but seeing him made me forget the pain I just endured.\n\nBut almost everyday since he was born, he wont let me rest, I haven't slept more than 3 to 4 hours (in 20 to 30 minute pieces) each day. I know he isnt doing it on purpose, but I am extremely cranky, frustrated and feeling like wanting this in the first place was all a huge mistake because we had an awesome life before deciding to have a baby. I have a great partner but he works so much, and I feel so bad for him when he has to take over for a while after work since his work is very physically demanding. We also don't have any family close by to ask for help.\n\nToday, at 6am I managed to shut my eyes for about 20 minutes when he decided to start bawling again (I had just fed and changed and cuddled him). I decided to just ignored him while gritting my teeth and wishing I was somewhere or someone else for 10 minutes until I couldn't take it anymore. The worse part is I don't know what he wants, I've read tricks to make him sleep, and nothing works.\n\nI hope this is just hormones and general fatigue that's making me say these awful things about my baby.",

            "selftext": "My husband, oldest two kids, and I have all started to watch our diet. We all need it desperately. I\u2019ve been trying to make food that\u2019s as close to what we would \u201cnormally\u201d eat as possible, just lower carbs and smaller portion sizes, and we\u2019ve been doing okay. Last night was Cottage Pie, but with cauliflower mash instead of potato. My youngest son doesn\u2019t like potatoes (lucky him), so I usually just give him the filling when I\u2019ve made it in the past. He DOES like cauliflower though, so I figured he\u2019d be able to eat the whole dish instead of just the inside....boy was I wrong. \n\nApparently because it looks like mashed potatoes, it must taste like mashed potatoes (don\u2019t I wish!) and he wouldn\u2019t even touch it. What ensued was a battle of wills the likes of which we\u2019ve never experienced before. He spent well over an hour crying because I refused to make him something else to eat. I told him he likes every single thing on that plate. EVERYTHING. But he refused. I peeled the mashed cauliflower off and told him to just eat the inside, but it was \u201ccontaminated\u201d by the fauxtatoes, so there was no bargaining with him. 3 hours we fought until it was bedtime. Every time he said he was hungry, I pointed to his dinner. I told him that I wouldn\u2019t budge, he told me his little tummy was starving. I told him if he was really \u201cstarving\u201d (he definitely wasn\u2019t, he snacked all the way up to an hour before dinner - thank you grandma), then he\u2019d eat his dinner. And if it wasn\u2019t gone by bedtime, he\u2019d be going to bed with a growling tummy. He didn\u2019t eat it and I didn\u2019t back down.\n\nOff to bed he went, with no dinner for the first time in his little life. He survived. Last night as I cuddled with him he told me that I\u2019m \u201cstill the best mommy\u201d. It hurt. I worried if I was making the right decision, but the pickiness has started to get out of control (this was not our first fight, but the first where I refused to give in because I KNEW there wasn\u2019t anything he disliked and this was purely psychological on his end). In the end I\u2019m glad I followed through. He wasn\u2019t hurt or damaged, and hopefully in the future he remembers this and makes the choice to eat what I\u2019ve made!",

            "selftext": "Throwaway. I chose support for my flair but advice is welcome. I just needed to type this out.\n\nWe\u2019ve lived in our neighborhood for three years and when we first moved, my daughter Jane was 8 years old. We tried to get her to connect with other 8 year old girls, but nothing really took. Jane enrolled in school and sort of made friends eventually, but it was a very long and challenging process with a lot of tears. She graduated from elementary school this spring and none of her friends have reached out to her this summer. Then about a year and a half ago,  one girl in our neighborhood, Emma, seemed interested in being friends with Jane. Emma is a year younger than Jane but they seemed to hit it off. Emma would invite Jane over to her house, they hung out when we all ran into each other at common spaces/events, etc. \n\nIn the meantime, this past winter we brought Jane to an area research hospital to have her assessed. She\u2019d been diagnosed earlier with ADHD and mild depression and the anxiety that goes along with ADHD. After her assessment, she was additionally diagnosed with high functioning autism, which did NOT surprise me. She misses cues, says the wrong thing at the wrong times, and has trouble with some kinds of conversation. Add in her impulse control as a result of the ADHD and she can come across a \u201cweird\u201d kid. I know this about her and I try to coach her when I can, but I also want her to be herself and feel like she is OK the way she is.\n\nThis weekend, I brought Jane to a neighborhood party, and Emma was there with her family. Emma\u2019s mom, Kate, comes up to me and locks me into a conversation about our kids, schools, etc. I\u2019m not really friends with Kate, though we do socialize and have mutual friends. So as we\u2019re sitting there talking about our kids she takes a big breath like she wants to get something out. She\u2019s smiling nice and big, too. Essentially she says to me that Jane makes Emma uncomfortable and that Emma doesn\u2019t know how to handle it. Jane stands too close and is awkward and Emma doesn\u2019t know what to do about it. Kate starts telling me how she is trying to coach Emma to \u201cjust be kind\u201d and polite and find excuses not to hang out. She is telling me this as though we\u2019re in this together as moms\u2014we\u2019re both just trying to help our kids! She also sort of acted out how stiff and uncomfortable Emma felt around Jane and how she told Emma to just \u201cblame things on her mom,\u201d i.e. \u201cI can\u2019t hang out right now because my mom and I are doing something.\u201d She then said \"I'm telling you this in case Jane ever comes home and says \"Why is Emma being mean to me?\"\n\nThe whole time I\u2019m standing there with a plate of pulled pork in my hand while Kate basically is telling me that my kid is  creepy, that she\u2019s creeping out her daughter, and that she\u2019s coaching her daughter in how to get away from my daughter. \n\nAnd here\u2019s the thing. I know Jane makes Emma uncomfortable because I\u2019m not a fucking idiot. I see it. I\u2019ve been gently trying to direct Jane away from Emma without telling her that Emma wants nothing to do with her. So first of all, I\u2019m not sure what Kate is trying to do/say beyond telling me to keep Jane away from Emma, which I already do, thanks very much. And secondly, and more poignantly, Jane has NO friends here in our community and no one who stuck in school. We are looking at one private school for next year but it\u2019s not like that will make her challenges go away. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the kind of thing where she just needs to find the kids who like her for who she is or if we need to give her more support and coaching.\n\nWhat I do know is that the heartbreak of hearing another parent tell you your weird kid makes their normal kid uncomfortable is not something I really know how to get over. And the fact that Kate did this in the middle of a party where I couldn\u2019t really do anything except smile and nod made it even worse. \n\nMy kid tries so hard. She wants friends so badly. She is smart, funny, artistic and yes\u2014she is odd. Right now her only friend is her little brother, who\u2019s five. I wish someone would just tell me how to help her and that everything would be OK for her someday. \n\nTL;DR: Another mom told me my HFA/ADHD kid makes her kid uncomfortable. I worry that this will be something my daughter has to deal with the rest of her life. I am angry at the mom, but I also want to help my daughter and I don\u2019t know how.",

            "selftext": "Hi r/parenting- it's 4 am and I can't sleep. I'm worried sick about something that happened to my daughter at camp last week.  I am a long time lurker on this sub, and I've always found this community to be so helpful and supportive, and now I'm reaching out because I really would appreciated some advice on the situation we are dealing with over here.\n\nHere's the story: My daughter (6) and son (almost 3) are signed up for a summer camp, it is their first year at the camp. My husband and I both work, so this camp is providing the childcare we need while school is out for the summer.  This camp has come highly recommended, we know multiple other families that send their kids there, and they really seem to have awesome activities for the kids. The typical camp day is 9-3 and then there is an aftercare program from 3- 6.  In the aftercare program, all the kids are together in the gymnasium and are allowed to do free play until their parents pick them up.  I usually pick my kids up by 4:30, so they spend about an hour in the gym playing before I get them. \n\nLast week, I arrived at the camp to get my kids as usual.  When you walk into the gym area, first you are in a little vestibule/hallway and then the gym doors are right there across the hallway.  Well, last week I walk in and My Daughter (MD) and an older boy are alone in the hallway together, off to my left.  Honestly, I think I was reading my phone when I walked into the building, so I really only saw them out of the corner of my eye. As soon as I walked in,  MD ran over to me and had this wide-eyed look on her face- the face she always makes when I've caught her doing something she's not supposed to.  I asked them what they were doing in the hallway, and the boy told me hurriedly that \"we were just getting a drink! We were just getting a drink!\" The second I laid eyes on this kid, I got a sense that he was off.... You know the vibe, just not a regular kid.   I went and got my son from the gym, signed my kids out, and left with them.  As soon as we got in the car, I asked my daughter \"who was that boy?\" She said \"I dunno.\" I asked \"Is he your friend?\" and she said \"yeah...\" and I could tell she didn't really want to talk about it.  I asked \"is everything ok?\" She said \"yeah.\" I didn't press any further at that point, but I had a weird vibe about the whole thing. \n\nYesterday (Monday) we are on our way to summer camp, about 2 minutes away and MD says quietly \"Mom, I'm nervous about going to camp.\" Let me pause here to tell you, this is very unlike MD.  She is the sort of kid that absolutely loves to go to camp, or any activity really.  She's not shy, and just is so excited to go play, so when she said this, right away I knew something was up. I turned around in the car and said \"Honey, why don't you want to go to camp?\" MD says \"Mom, remember that boy you saw me with last week?\" Right away my heart is in my stomach, because I know exactly what boy she is talking about.  She proceeds to tell us (her father was in the car too) that The Boy (TB) asked her if she wants to be his girlfriend and kissed her on the lips.  She told me she was scared and that she didn't want to be his girlfriend, but that she wanted to go to summer camp.  Of course all this is happening as we are rolling up to the camp. I asked her if anything else happened, and she said no.  I didn't have time to get the details at that point, so we made the split second decision to still go to camp that day, because MD still really wanted to go.  \n\nI told MD that I was proud of her for telling us what happened and that I would make sure that it didn't happen again.  I took MD into the camp and asked to speak to the director.  The director, Jeff, was obviously extremely concerned with what happened.  We talked at length about what transpired. We agreed that they would question TB and find out what went down, as well as discuss with his parents immediately.   They would then reconvene with us and we would go from there.  Jeff said, if TB admits to it, we are going to kick him out of camp, because it's just unacceptable behavior from a boy his age. TB is 13 years old, one of the oldest campers at the camp.   \n\nAfter Jeff questioned TB and spoke to his parents he called me back to fill me in.  TB, of course, denied that anything happened.  \n\n I found out TB is 13 years old, just finished 8th grade and is on his way to high school in the fall.  He has been at the camp for a few years and has always been odd.. He does not make friends in his own age group easily so will resort to playing with younger children, especially in the aftercare program when all the kids are together.  He has a lot of issues during the regular school year with being bullied so camp is his \"happy place.\"  Jeff told me that TB's parents were devastated and assured me they were doing everything they could to address this with their son.  Jeff told me the ball was in my court, if we insisted that we didn't want TB back at the camp, they would throw him out. Jeff reassured me that all their staff would be retrained and that new policies/procedures would be put in place so that children are never alone in the hallway again.  I told Jeff that I wanted to discuss further with MD and find out some more details and to discuss with my husband.  \n\nI was pacing the floor counting the seconds until I could pick MD up from camp.  Like I said earlier, she told us literally a minute away from camp, so I had no details about what transpired.  I was (am) beside myself with worry and wanted to get the full scoop on what happened.  \n\nI got MD and her brother from camp.  The second she hops in the car she tells me \"Mom! Guess what?  TB wasn't even at camp today! I didn't even have to worry about him!\"  She then proceeds to tell me all the fun stuff she did- swimming, games etc.  I get them home and set her brother up playing in the sandbox, and she and I sat on our swing set.  I told her again how proud of her that she told us about what happened with TB. I told her that she was not in trouble at all, and that the reason TB was not at camp today is because he is in trouble for kissing her.  I explained to her that older teenagers often have boyfriends or girlfriends and kiss and whatnot, but she is far too young for that and that TB was wrong to try that with her.  I explained that I spoke with the camp, and TB would never be bothering her again.  She said she was relieved about that.  I told her that she needs to tell me exactly what happened-  what they were doing before the hallway, why did they go out there, etc.  MD told me that TB came up to her in the gym.  He asked what grade she was in and she told him kindergarten.  He told her he was in 3rd grade.  He then told her to go in the hallway with him.  As soon as they went out there, he kissed her on the lips.  Then he told her it was a secret and that she shouldn't tell anyone about it.  MD said at that moment, I walked in the building and they ran over to me.\n\nThat's pretty much it.  I had a long conversation with MD about good touching vs bad touching and that if anyone ever makes her feel scared or nervous she should come to me immediately.  I reassured her that the camp would make sure that nothing like this every happened again.  MD seemed fine with this and was her usual awesome self for the rest of the night.\n\nWe've spoken to Jeff again last night- we told him that we didn't want to make the decision for them if TB would be kicked out or not- they are the ones that know TB and they are also the ones responsible for all the children's safely.  One one hand, I feel really bad for TB, knowing his history and social issues.  On the other hand, I fiercely want to protect my daughter.  \n\nJeff has decided that TB will miss the rest of this week.  Starting next week, he can return to camp, but will not be allowed in the aftercare program, which is really his main time to interact with younger children (the camp is pretty regimented during the day, and kids are grouped with their own age group.) He reassured us once again that all the staff would be retrained and alerted about this, and nothing like this would ever happen again.  \n\nI am beating myself up like you would not believe.  Why didn't I question her further that day when I found them in the hall?  Am I the biggest idiot?  Should I not trust this camp with my kids?  \n\nWhat would you do in this situation? To me, TB has exhibited some predatory-type behavior here.  A lot of what MD told me TB did are classic red flags.  The fact that he lied and said he was in 3rd grade to gain her trust and then instigated getting her into the hallway, followed by insisting that it was a secret... it's pretty disturbing behavior.  That being said, I don't think anything more than a kiss transpired- thank God I walked in when I did.  I'm thinking this may be a good thing because his parents are now alerted to this behavior and can intervene.  On the other hand, what if he tries something like this again?  I don't want anyone to ever experience the hell we have gone through in the last 2 days, and I would be beside myself if I found out he did this to another child.\n\nWhat would you do in this situation?  Insist that TB not be allowed at camp?  Should I enroll my daughter in therapy?  Any advice would be appreciated.",

The rest of our family still wants to eat meat. I am doing my best to support her, but I would appreciate some advice on how to make sure a still fairly picky child gets adequate nutrition from a vegetarian diet. \n\nShe has been at it solid for about a week. I think she's doing a great job exploring her pallet and making healthy choices, but I'm afraid that she isn't getting enough calories. We have decided that at both lunch and dinner she is to choose a \"pouch\" (the toddler food with vegetables/grains/fruits) to ensure that she gets plenty of servings of vegetables. \n\nWe have opened a dialogue about what we eat and why we need various nutrients. We have attempted to convert  our typical family meals into vegetarian options. We have agreed to have two meatless dinners a week as a family. \n\nHow else can I support her? What do I need to teach her about food choices before she goes to Kindergarten in the fall? Do school lunches even come with a vegetarian option? \n\nI would love ANY advise on the subject including veggie kid friendly recipes! Help!",

I really dont miss all the trash content that youtube has for kids so I'll likely just keep this ban up for as long as I can, he begged a bit to watch youtube again at first but now he doesnt even ask about it anymore and is just fine watching shows and movies on netflix instead. \n\nSo I have no regrets at all getting rid of youtube, I highly recommend it.",

            "selftext": "So, I think Im really laid back normally, I cook, I clean, I work, doesnt bother me that I do it, but Im starting to get really pissed off about him staying up. I finished work the day I went into labour and we now have a 1yo boy and a newborn baby girl. Ive been changing and feeding the both of them, we are about 10 days in and hes done maybe 4 nappy changes total. The worst part is he has been staying up until 5am playing games and blaming it on the fact he just cant sleep because staying at home isnt tiring enough.\n\nI dont get it? I asked him is he doing it to have his own time as he goes into the living room and plays on the laptop/ps4/xbox but he said no, and he games and watches youtube freely during the day also. Its only bothering me because I feel like its massively unfair, I should be resting as I am taking the brunt of it while trying to recover and since he is up all through the night he should at least do the night feeds/ help with our sons teething as I am expressing milk. I thought that was what paternity was for?\n\nIts gotten to the point that Ill be up at 2am, 5am, 7am and then finally have to get up at 9am to feed our son his breakfast, be juggling two kids up until he wakes at 1pm-3pm and then have the smallest effort of help which is him helping our son learn boundaries by calling him into the other room when shes awake...\n\nIve spoken to him about it and he says to just ask him for help, but how the fuck can I ask him for help when hes passed out for the majority of the day and only has to see the kids for about 5-6hours before they are asleep again? I just needed to get this off my chest because I finally broke down this morning because the cramps were getting so bad, and when I did leave him to watch our son while I fed and changed our daughter our son managed to destroy expensive makeup and computer equipment on my desk and my husband just ignored it because he was in a csgo game, tried to cover it up by putting it back but only spoke about it when I noticed makeup marks on the bedsheets.\n\nI think Im going crazy",

            "selftext": "I went anon for obvious reason.\n\nI\u2019m not cut out for this. I don\u2019t enjoy mothering, not at all. I\u2019ve been feeling like this for about a year now. I\u2019m aggravated all day every day that I have my kids. By bedtime I\u2019m so at my wits end I can barely bring myself to tuck them in nicely. It takes all my restraint to actually put them into the blankets, kiss them, tell them goodnight. Most nights I mentally cannot hang out long enough to read them a story, I have to rush out of there and shut them in the room.\n\nMy kids are 3 and 2. They\u2019re at the stereotypical \u201chard\u201d ages but I feel like my hatred and inability of being a parent and all it entails goes deeper than that. I feel awful that these years are really molding them and I spend so much of my time with them correcting behavior, disciplining, or just outright ignoring them because I can\u2019t deal with them anymore. I feel like I can\u2019t spend quality time with them because by the time I have a \u201cbreak\u201d from all the other duties I have, I\u2019m so aggravated with them I just stick them in the playroom or in front of a TV because I can\u2019t stand to be around them. Like after working all day and trying to get them home, trying to get them to sit down and eat without making a huge mess, getting them through bath time and teeth brushed, the meltdowns and aggravation that come with all of it, I\u2019m just DONE. That would be the opportune time to actually sit down with them and spend some quality time and I just can\u2019t. I\u2019m too irritated by that point.\n\nAnd I only have them half the time. They\u2019re with their dad every other week. When they\u2019re gone I miss them constantly, I do. By the time it\u2019s my week I can\u2019t wait to see them again, but that excitement quickly dissipates. By the Sunday after my week, I am counting down the minutes that I can take them back to their dad. \n\nI feel like I try so hard to get up in a good mood and be really patient. I\u2019ve tried so many different approaches and techniques. Still, by the end of breakfast there\u2019s been so much bickering between the two, whining, thrown food, wasted food, I\u2019ve been asked a thousand questions, and I\u2019m cranky as hell. Without fail. \n\nIt\u2019s too late now to decide I don\u2019t want to be a mom but honestly this last week has tried me to the point I\u2019m considering asking my ex husband if he wants full custody. I just can\u2019t handle the annoyance of trying to raise tiny humans. I\u2019m so aggravated and drained.\n\nHas anyone else been here? Does it get better? Am I not maternal enough to handle this?",

            "selftext": "My daughter is about to turn 5, I was spanking her as punishment but a friend talked to me and showed me studies, etc about how spanking is proven not effective and to cause negative effects. I feel like an idiot because it seems obvious now, but I never questioned it before. I was on the \"it's what my parents did\" train. \n\nAnyway, is just stopping good enough? I've already used spanking as the standard punishment, is the damage done? Also, what are your best tips for curbing her behavior that don't involve spanking? \n\nHer biggest troubles are screaming and talking back when she doesn't get her way. My parents are well off and we used to live with them and they would buy her anything she wanted, but we have moved out and i can't and won't buy her a toy every time we leave the house. This makes her act out in stores and throw fits. Will she get used to not being as spoiled with gifts or do I need to be more proactive in curbing that behavior/thought process? Is the entitled attitude going to go away?\n\nShe's a very sweet girl until she asks for something she can't have, but she also has trouble with her daycare teachers and previously her pre k teachers. They send home letters about her having to be told repeatedly to sit down and stop talking and pay attention. Shes not even 5 yet so I mostly brush it off as an age thing. She isn't trying to be 'bad' but she starts kindergarten in August, how can I help her stay focused? Or should I just let her be 5? It feels like standard behaviour, but I don't want her labeled as a bad kid by being more distracted than the others.\n\nSorry I'm all over the place, I was already trying to figure some stuff out here but now I know I shouldn't spank her too so I feel lost a bit. Which is ridiculous, but I want to do right.\n\nIf it matters her dad and i were divorced when she was 1, he comes to see her a couple times a year. I say that to say I'm the only one punishing her for bad behavior and I'm the only one who needs to change the process here.",

She overheard our 5-year-old saying something along the lines of \"I wanna kill Mommy.\" She comes into the kitchen a few minutes later, starts doing the dishes, here's a noise behind her, and who is him pointing a knife at her.  He didn't come at her, he didn't try to stab her or anything.  Is she freaked out, which made him freak out and turn, etc. She threatened to call the police on him, he started crying, etc. She later asked him what he intended to do. At first, he said that he just wanted to get a knife to cut the pizza into smaller pieces. Then he admitted that he wanted to kill her. She asked him if he understood what it means for a person to die - that you'll never see them again, because they don't come back from death. He doesn't seem to grasp the concept of death entirely - he thinks people can come back. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs this one of those normal episodes of childhood?

            "selftext": "I take my kids to the playground by our house after school. And since its June, the sprinklers are on. My kids, no lie, will hand me their bookbags and run to the sprinklers as soon as they step foot inside the playground. Theyre usually still wearing their uniforms and sneakers etc. But i have several pairs of their uniforms. One per day. Theyre polo shirts made from cotton so not difficult fabric or anything. So i honestly couldn't care less when they hop in the sprinklers and get completely soaked. Lately we've been having really hot weather. (fells like 90'sF) But for the past couple of days i've been getting weird looks from the other parents. They'll stare at me and then my kids. They also tell their kids not to get into the sprinklers or theyre in trouble. (because of the uniforms? beats me..) Twice my children invited their classmates into the sprinklers and the children follow my kids in. Theyre laughing and playing and splashing each other and then comes their parents all angry and tell them they need to get out of there immediately. One actually pulled his son out and then stared me down like its my fault for allowing my kids in there. Like my kids are bad influences or something.. Am i missing something? Am i the weird parent that doesn't care if my kids aren't wearing swimsuits and just want them to be happy??",

This has apprently been happening for a couple months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt came out when my 9 year old daughter visited that same house and the 7-yr old said she couldn't go to the bathroom unless he could watch and she fought back.  Then the 5-year old shared the \"secret\" with his older sister.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know kids mess around a bit with this kind of stuff, but this is beyond normal messing around levels.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've talked to his parents.  We're not ending the friendship, but they don't get to play inside anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm curious if a 5 year old may need any other support or help with something like this?  On one hand, I don't want this to fell like a big deal to him.  We've talked about how people shouldn't get to touch you in swimsuit zone and how people who tell you to keep secrets from mom and dad are just trying to do bad things.  He's fairly nonchalant about the whole thing so far.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd I don't know how much he'll remember as a 5 year old.  But I also don't want him to carry some kind of burden of having broken a secret or done something wrong or even just normalizing behavior that probably shouldn't be normalized.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know the reddit reflex is always \"get a counselor\", but I'm not sure if that would make the situation better (by helping him figure this out) or make it worse (by cementing it in his head as a significant event).",

            "selftext": "This story is like a stupid movie you start on Netflix but don't watch past minute 10 because you're smart enough to figure out what's about to happen to the dumbass protagonist. \n\nMy husband and I have 8-year-old twins. For years, YEARS we tried for a third. I would have done anything to hold one baby in my arms. But I was infertile. For nearly a decade. And during the Clomid, IUIs, IVFs, I lost my hair and my sanity. I was sick and depressed and miserable. In the meantime, I started medical school and my two boys, difficult to begin with, became increasingly disruptive in school and got just ALL the diagnoses and IEPs, etc. \n\nLast year, we went for our last embryo. It was a girl, and the genetic screening said she was perfect. I probably shouldn't have tried for her, because our life was already insane, but it was my last one and I couldn't resist the idea of that perfect girl in my arms. \n\nThe embryo didn't stick, and something beautiful happened. Of course I was sad, and we cried. But suddenly I was free. Free to stop continually preparing my body for some imaginary pregnancy, free to enjoy my boys as the only kids I'd ever have, free to make an aggressive plan to pay off my husband's law school and my medical loans. Free to fantasize about vacations without including the part about trying to smear sandy zinc oxide on uncooperative slugs. (Embarrassing: I got coolsculpting because my post-twins body was finally mine to fuck around with.)\n\nAnd then, one night, my husband and I randomly (and I am talking RANDOMLY, because we barely ever have sex due to conflicting sleep and work schedules) had sex and then watched Barry on HBO. Barry is a great show! You should watch it!\n\nAnd I was late for my period, and I took one of the 10,000 bulk pregnancy tests I had ordered on Amazon over the years, and it was super positive. I had been looking at bone-white pregnancy sticks for years and this one turned pink in 4 seconds. And I hyperventilated. And my husband was maybe happy? But also hyperventilating.\n\nAnd then I cried for a week and got on a waiting list for a local daycare and imagined my body trying to haul ass through residency and trying to work 80-hour weeks and see all three of my kids. And lose all the financial ground we'd worked so hard for. And care for two (very likely three!) special-needs children and my very sweet but also eccentric husband. And I imagined naming my baby and holding my baby and breastfeeding (I didn't get to do it the first time). And I cried and cried and talked to my family and cried. \n\nSo I'm getting an abortion tomorrow. And if I had a million dollars, I wouldn't. If I had excellent schools that were more supportive of special needs, I wouldn't. If I had more time with the family I already have, I wouldn't. If residency was a normal job with humane hours, I wouldn't. If my mom lived next door, I wouldn't. But I am. There's just too much to fight through, and I'm 37, and I'm tired, and I want to be kind to myself and give everything I have to my patients and my family. So that's why I, an adult, moronic woman with a bonkers story, am getting an abortion tomorrow.",

I'm also proud of the fact that he doesn't give into pressure for sports, he tried a few sports a couple of times each, said no, and that was the end of that. Other son, not so strong willed... he's been giving in to the pressure for years. I finally took him out for good. He can't stop thanking me.",

I was handling it, telling her she \u201c can have the toy when we get back to the car if she calmed down\u201d\n\nOut of nowhere an older lady comes up next to my daughter and started telling her that \u201c if you don\u2019t stop crying right now ,mommy isn\u2019t going to feed you any of that yummy dinner ,she\u2019s going to make. Do you want to go to bed hungry? Stop crying \u201c \n\nAnd then she walked away.\n\nThere are so many things wrong with that statement. 1st - of all I would NEVER not feed my child as punishment for acting like a 3.5 year old. 2nd - way to assume I\u2019m the cook to the family .. I\u2019m not. 3rd - it\u2019s not like I was just letting her pitch a fit , I was talking to her about her feelings and how to act in the store.  I mean she\u2019s freaking 3.5... we all know they aren\u2019t the most rational people in the wrong.\n\nAnyway what\u2019s your stranger in public story?!?",

            "selftext": "I'm so sick of being a parent to him. I know that's horrible to say but it's just where I'm at. He's a horrible child. While he's *extremely* intelligent - he's four and has been talking since about 12 months, and I mean full sentences. I honestly think he could be placed comfortably in first grade right now - but he's vindictive, cruel, mean-spirited, and overall miserable to be around. He never says nice things or does anything with even slightly good intentions. It's 24/7 chaos. \n\nHe outright refuses to potty train. He told me he won't use the toilet because he likes to make me sad. I told him that that's not nice, and he said \"I know.\" I have to change this child that speaks and acts like an elementary schooler. Sometimes he intentionally kicks and struggles so feces get onto wherever I happen to be changing him.\n\nHe hurts other children. Other parents tell me that he's still little and doesn't understand, but he does. He clearly plans these things out - watching his baby sister from afar for a while, for example, only to immediately grab her by the head and drag her/slap her/kick her the second my eyes aren't locked on her. He maliciously follows other children at playgrounds to steal slides and swings just before they were about to use them, tailing behind them constantly to \"haha\" in their faces. \n\nHe jumps on me and his mother. Climbs up on things, and just jumps on us. He lands on our heads and necks and it hurts, but he thinks it's hilarious.\n\nHe's dragged chairs out to the stove when we aren't around to INTENTIONALLY touch the hot burner.\n\nHe intentionally ruins fun outings by dropping to the floor and screaming like we're hurting him if we touch him - and don't think he's doing it for attention, because he's hiding a stupid little smirk the whole time.\n\nHe actively lies. Sister gets hurt, he lies. Food gets dumped, he lies. He hurts himself or the cat, he lies about it too. He does it for fun, not because he's worried about consequences. \n\nHe's started breaking out of the house. We lock all the doors with childproof locks but he's figured them out and he's begun opening the doors/windows and booking it down the street, laughing the whole time.\n\nAnd it's not like we haven't been disciplining him. We've talked to him clearly. He also very clearly responds that he doesn't care. We've lost our cool before, admittedly, and screamed at him after a long day of him torturing us and his sister, destroying furniture and hurting the cat, unplugging the TV so we have to set the whole thing up again. He laughed when we screamed too. My wife slapped his hand once and although it left a mark, he laughed.\n\nI hate him. I hate him all day long, I can't stand him, he makes everyone miserable. Baby sister is scared to death of him. I've seriously considered giving him to my brother's family. They foster children and are used to bullshit like this. My wife has been looking into boarding schools. \n\nWe're calm and understanding with him 95% of the time but when we're alone, all we can talk about is getting away from him. I'm scared of what he'll be like in his teens.\n\nToday he pitched a huge fit. Biting, screaming, trying to hide his laughter, saying hurtful things \"I don't love any of you/I hate all of you/Go hurt yourself\". I tried hugging him, carrying him to his room for time out, distracting him, trying to talk his feelings out.. nothing, per usual, he's laughing in my face. So I dropped him. Not my proudest moment, but I did. He landed flat on his butt. He laughed, and then started to spit at me/kick me. I very, very nearly slapped him across the face, but I stopped myself.\n\nI'm hiding in my bedroom now. The door is locked, and he's screaming bloody murder outside it. I want to get away from him. Take my daughter and wife and leave. He makes me feel like I live in a horror movie.",

            "selftext": "I'm a stay at home mom and my husband is on a \"business trip\" this week. I say \"business trip\" because personally it seems more like a vacation. Its a golf tournament, so for 3 days he golfs during the day and at night he goes to the casino, drinks, and eats $200 steaks. I don't judge him for wanting to go, but god I'm so jealous. He's doing all this fun stuff and I'm stuck at home brushing teeth and wiping asses. I'm jealous but I was holding it together.\n\nThat was until my husband called and told me that his coworker has an extra ticket to The Who tonight. My husband hardly even listens to The Who and he gets fucking free tickets! I'm stuck here breaking up a fight for the fourth time and he's going to see The Who. I love The Who! I've dreamed about seeing them live since I watched their Superbowl performance when I was a teenager. I just couldn't hold it together anymore and cried. \n\nI feel terrible about it, he's a great husband. He supported me when I was working and he supports me now that I'm not. I should be happy for him, but I just can't. I know this probably makes me a terrible wife. He just always gets to do these awesome trips with his work or goes out to get a few beers with work friends, while I'm stuck at home with the kids. \n\nI could get a job but it'll be call center or retail work, I got pregnant at 19 and have only ever worked retail. I don't have the experience nor the degree to get a good job. I've thought about going to school but I have no idea what I'd go for. I'm 27 and still have no idea what I want to be when I grow up. \n\nAlso part of me honestly loves being a stay at home mom. I don't have to talk to people I can't stand. I can wear pajamas all day and cleaning can be therapeutic. But it's just so fucking lonely. I lost all my childless friends when I got pregnant. I lost all my work friends when I stopped working. I'm an anxiety ridden introvert so making friends is tough. All the mom groups in my area are full of mlm -pushing, anti-vaccinating, bible thumping, organic eating moms and I just don't fit in. I want to go on a mom-cation but don't want to go alone. \n\nSo tonight my husband is going to see one of the greatest bands of all time and I'm going to scrounge up all the leftover Easter chocolate and cry myself to sleep. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR    I'm a selfish and terrible because I'm upset my husband is going to see The Who and I'm not.",

My son mentioned that he would like a graduation party and I honestly had to hide my laughter.

Today in after school care, My daughter (10 F 5th grade) I will call her K, was repeatedly groped by a 3rd or 4th grade boy. Apparently, as the teacher  has told me, this is an on going issue. She told him no,  many times, and he continued.  Eventually K had enough and snapped at this kid which lead to an argument.  The teacher,  trying to break it up asked the younger child to move places, he refused.  Again trying to defuse the situation she asked K to move. SHE was PISSED! Argued and eventually complied. The teacher told me K  \"felt it was incredibly unfair.\". I had to bite my tongue,  talk down my rightfully upset 10 year old and explain to her the teacher was just trying to stop a fight, though she is the one being repeatedly,  sexually harassed. I am livid.  We are supposed to be teaching our boys to be better MEN and yet Keana is the one who is asked to move. \"It's ok if he touches you sweetie,  just move away\" is no longer fucking acceptable! This isn't the 1950s! There is literally a day and a half left in school and I want nothing more than for this little boy to learn the right way to treat a woman, but what really can I do? Go to the Principal? Ignore the situation like society accepts? How do I look my daughter in the eye, as her dad, and tell her there is nothing I can do. Accept the situation,  you go to a new school this fall.  Advice?",

I do love spending time with them, going on walks, listening to their piano practices and reading to them and with them.  But there's a countless of other things that literally make me lose my mind. Sitting on the floor and playing with their dolls, play dough, eating pretend food, and other such repetitive games make me scream on the inside. \n\nA few months ago, I bought a mini earpod (for one ear only). I pop it in and cover the one ear with my hair. I listen to podcasts but I still have an ear available to listen and interact with them. I also don't stress about missing parts of the podcast if I get too distracted and I pause as needed. It has really helped me unwind as well after a long day's of work. I feel bad about it but I also feel like it's a good hack.",

There have been men walking up and down my street all week knocking on my door with a clipboard in hand. Two different people showed up today, one this afternoon and I ignored it, but a second one just showed up and my kid happens to be napping. My dog of course goes ballistic and I calm him down... the guy knocks a second time sending my dog into full attack dog mode so I run to the door and point to the NO SOLICITING sigh on my door!!! He says he\u2019s not soliciting and before he could explain to me I cut him off and yelled \u201cI can\u2019t, you\u2019re going to wake up my kid!!!\u201d and I slammed the door. I might\u2019ve been rude, but every second my dog barked was another chance my kid was going to hear him and wake up. Does anyone have creative ways of getting people to not knock on their door during nap time?",

            "selftext": "Hi, everyone!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy 14 yr old 8th grader was told that she needs glasses. She isn't fazed by it at all, and is looking forward to being able to see the board much better in school. I took my daughter to the eye doctor for her exam, but the day (two days later) she went to go pick out her glasses at the glasses store, my husband took her because I had to go to book club and take my younger daughter to a birthday party.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy the time they got back, I was already home. My daughter comes home in a huff, and goes up to her room, seemingly angry. My husband comes in, looking annoyed. I ask my husband, \"Did she not like any of the glasses she tried on?\" Husband responds, \"They were all so expensive. I told her she had to pay for them!\" My jaw dropped.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur health insurance is very good, but in terms of eye coverage, it covers the eye doctor visit, but not the glasses. We already knew this (as I wear glasses) and it was no surprise. I get that glasses can be pricey, and that you can save money by buying them online, but I want her first pair to be from a physical place and to make sure she likes them. The cost is NOT an issue---the issue here is that my husband expected my 8TH GRADER to use her babysitting and birthday money to pay for her glasses!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo an extent, I can understand her paying a portion if she was dead set on expensive, fancy frames---but still, she's 14 years old for goodness sake! I told him he was completely wrong, and asked him if she picked out some expensive, fancy frame. He said no. He said that in total, the glasses would be $125, which in my opinion, isn't that bad at all. He said he urged her to pick out the most basic frames and lense package, and that she panicked and said she didn't want the glasses once he asked her to pay for them, even a portion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUpon talking to my daughter, she didn't want to spend a large portion of her savings on her glasses. I reassured her that we would go back to the glasses shop, just her and me, and she could pick out any frames (within reason) she wanted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs my husband the crazy one for expecting our daughter to pay for her glasses???? She's a kid, 14 years old, who makes little money babysitting and saved up money from holidays and birthdays. My husband has been cold for the past day or so and we haven't spoken---any advice? I seriously DID NOT expect this from him at all. Thoughts? Advice?",

I'm in therapy for it and taking medication so I'm on the road to recovery but I still have tough days.  \n\n\nThis morning I had a break down. I was being really down on myself and had a lot of self disgust. But my son needed a wipe for his runny nose. So I went to get him one and accidentally spilled something on the way. It was the straw that broke the camels back. I collapsed on the floor and started sobbing.   \n\n\nNormally I try my best to do my crying out of my son's view. I don't want him to worry about his dad. I want to be a rock for him. Strong and stable. But in this moment I couldn't help it.   \n\n\nBut when my son noticed me crying I couldn't have been prouder. He came up to me and said \"why are you crying daddy\" and I said through my sobbing... \"I don't know....\"  \n\n\nHe gave me as big of a hug as his little arms could and he said \"It's okay daddy.\"   \n\n\nHe ran over to his wipes and brought them over to me and tried to dry my eyes. He asked me to blow my nose. I did. He grabbed the tissue from me and said \"It's okay I throw that away for you daddy.\"  \n\n\nI grabbed him and gave him the biggest squeeze.

            "selftext": "Hello,\n\nEarlier tonight I caught my daughter on the phone and something just felt off, so I pressed her about who she was talking to. She lied to me, I knew it, and kept asking until she finally told me it was a guy she met online. I immediately took her phone from her and asked questions. She claims he is 17, but he looks older to me. Something told me to check the messages and it is very, very, VERY sexually explicit. It would make a porn star blush. I'm beyond upset over having to read my daughter say these things and have them said to her. They also do video calls often. He coerces her repeatedly into sending nudes, starting with small stuff like asking to show her legs, her bare shoulders, underwear, and gradually moves up the list. When she doesn't respond to him right away, he gets controlling and emotionally manipulates her. He sent her photos of his penis multiple times and instructs her through text how to do sexual things.\n\nI know a lot of parents think their children are angels, but I cannot express to you enough how I never thought this would be my child. She has always been an honors student, is president of her Mathletes chapter, is in a college scholars program, and has never missed a day of school in her life. Until tonight, I've never once had to punish her because she's never really done anything to deserve it. That said, his hold over her is so great that she often tells him she will \"throw everything away\" for him. They were making plans to meet this summer. He was even scheming ways to get her sex toys. I mean... what the fuck?\n\nI was able to find enough clues in his photos to verify his identity and eventually found his parents on Facebook but still can't confirm his age. **I want to go to the police, but if he is actually 17 is there even anything I could legally do?** Should I approach his parents? As much as I'd love to post this fucked up shit all over their Facebook page, I feel like I need to handle this carefully. I've had the talk with her so many times about online safety but I failed. I feel like a complete failure. I trusted her and wow... what a tremendous mistake. She's already in counseling because she struggles with body dysphoria after puberty, which resulted in a lot of depression and anxiety, so when we meet with them again this coming Friday, this topic will be brought up. I told her we'd talk today after I've had a chance to process everything. We already have plans to completely eliminate her free access to the internet for the time being and will discuss more when my husband gets home from work today. \n\nThank you in advance for any advice.",

I told her no, no milk until she's older, and that we aren't doing solids for at least another week or two as it is.

Personally, I think she should have had to wake up early to finish it but that wasn't a battle I cared to fight.\n\nShe called me from school today. She forgot the work at home. I told her tough sh!t. It was her responsibility. \n\n\"But mom! I'm going to fail!\" \n\nWho knows if it was good parenting or not but kid, remember to do your work. It's my job to guide you, and my job to help you, but it's not my job to keep you from being accountable. \n\nSo, because I said no, she'll likely get a zero. I feel mostly confident I made the right call.\n\nMostly....",

We came in Monday at noon because she had vomited overnight and in the morning and within 24 hours she was undergoing a surgery to save her life. I watched as she vomited more fluid than I ever thought possible.  As she opened her eyes one more time and looked at an ER doctor and said \u201cDada.\u201d  My heart broke hearing my little girl looking for her dad and knowing i couldn\u2019t do anything. I was in the ER holding onto her foot, with my wife, as they performed chest compressions and saying \u201cwe have no pulse.\u201d  I was sure i saw the life leave her eyes.  After a lifetime it seemed passed I heard one of the doctors say \u201cI hear a pulse but I can\u2019t feel it.\u201d  We get pulled out of the ER and get told that she has an obstructed bowel and they need to get her stabilized enough so she can have surgery.  When she is stabilized up in the PICU room, the attending physician sits down with us and fills us in on what happened in the ER.  Tells us that our little daughter, who has already gone through a previous intense surgery that she was in the PICU for a month, was in cardiac arrest for 20 mins.  They tell us that she was dead for 20 mins.  They tell us that they tried their best to deliver oxygen and blood to her body but they have no idea how her brain is doing.  If her brain was compromised.  Before we get settled the Pediatric general surgeon tells us what he sees from the CT scan of her belly.  She has a twisted bowel that is compromised and they need to open her up and take it out.  She is whisked to surgery, that goes successfully, and now has 3 feet less of her small intestine.  Scar tissue from her previous liver surgery had attached itself to her bowel and encouraged it to twist on itself.  So for the past 36 hours I sat in her PICU room, hoping and praying that the MRI on her brain tonight will show little to no damage.  That all this wasn\u2019t for naught.  That we didn\u2019t save her life for there to be nothing left.  That i still get to experience life with my daughter.  Her ups and downs, achievements and failures.  That I get to watch her ride a bike or take swim lessons.  That I get to walk her down the aisle.  Cause I fear mine and my wife\u2019s love won\u2019t be enough.  That she is so young that this has become too much for her to fight through.  I fear that I can\u2019t go on without her.  She changed me so much in her short time that it can\u2019t be over.  \n\nI hope that any of you reading this can send some positive thoughts to NJ.  I hope that the encouraging and overwhelming force of kindness from internet strangers can help my daughter out.  I hope that it can convince some higher force to spare my little girl cause I am scared and feeling hopeless.",

            "selftext": "I have a son. He is 1 year and 4 months old. The first year was HARD work. My wife and I were reduced to tears on a number of occasions. There was very little return for all of the hard work we put in. He would wake up several times a night, every night. Vomiting, poopy disgusting nappies, crying for no reason, tummy bugs. My wife and I couldn't just 'do our own thing' anymore. We were committed to this little bundle of joy and there were times when I thought my life was over. My wife and I were at breaking point on a few occasions too. \n\nOver the past month or so something in his brain seems to have clicked. He is a conscious little being now. He reacts to us, he laughs at us, he makes us laugh, he does this cute thing were he snuggles into you when he is tired. He communicates in his own language and waves goodbye when I go to work. We're not 100% in the clear, he now has mini tantrums and opens doors, eats his own body weight in food everyday, climbs stairs and falls over.... a lot. But he is consolable. He is reactive. He is... well, a human.\n\nI just wanted to let you know that it will get better. Perhaps not in the same way or at the same time. But it will get better. It makes me excited for the future and actually sharing experiences with my son, playing video games, going on bike rides, days at the beach. So this is why people have kids huh? It's pretty cool.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust wanted to share my thoughts. Thanks for listening! :)",

I love her very much and I want her to be as comfortable as possible, and I want to be the best father figure I possibly can to her. \n\nI am getting her in therapy starting next week so she can properly process the death of our parents, I am trying my hardest to make sure she eats nutritious food and exercise enough each day, I make sure she does her homework, and I make sure that she goes to bed at a good time, but I'm not really sure what to do beyond that.\n\nI haven't had to do it yet, but I feel like I am going to struggle with setting up rules and routines to streamline her life so it doesn't totally fall apart. Punishment is a totally foreign concept to me, and I'd have no idea how to go about something like that, or if punishment for breaking rules is even considered a healthy thing these days.\n\nAre there any books I can read to improve my \"parenting\" skills?

            "selftext": "Update to my original post. Not sure how to link it on mobile, but it was about the mom making the kids give their build a bears up to the birthday girl. \n\n\n\nThis afternoon at school pickup me and another parent had a chance to talk with the mom of the party. It wasn\u2019t a long conversation, but I\u2019ll do my best to re-enact it here. Moms fake name will be Karen.\n\n*Insert awkward small talk here* \n\nKaren- ... I hope the girls enjoyed (daughters) party the other day. I know (daughter) had lots of fun. \n\nOther mom- Haha yeah I was actually wondering about the whole (daughter) getting all the bears \nthing. The kids seemed pretty upset afterwards. \n\nKaren- Oh yeah we wanted (daughter) to have a special animal decorated by each of her friends. \n\nMe- Oh okay. I was just wondering why the kids didn\u2019t get to keep their bears. I even pitched in a little bit of money, assuming the bears would go to the kids. \n\nKaren- Well I didn\u2019t have enough money for each of the guests to make their own, that would get pretty expensive! If you want your money back I\u2019ll see about getting it back to you. I don\u2019t really see the problem though. \n\nMe- Okay, well the kids were forced to give away their new creations, obviously they are going to be upset about it. I also don\u2019t see why your daughter needs all these animals. \n\nKaren didn\u2019t respond and walked away right after, probably offended. \n\nWhat bothers me is she said she \u201cdidn\u2019t have enough money for all the kids to have one\u201d, but she did have enough for her daughter to get like 8 bears. Just doesn\u2019t really make sense. \n\nNow I admit I\u2019m not the most confrontational person, so I probably should have talked to her more about it. Anyways, I guess we sort of worked it out, no ones fighting, so I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m going to mention it to her again. Sorry this wasn\u2019t the most satisfying ending. But thanks for all the love and support, it means a lot.",

            "selftext": "Earlier today I went to a birthday party for my daughters (6) friend from school. The party was being held at Build a Bear, but it wasn\u2019t run by the employees. We had cake and pizza in the food court, then went down to BAB to make bears, then back to friends house for the rest of the party. \n\nThe invitation said each kid (about 8 total) would get to make a Bear, and I just assumed they would get to take them home, since that is what happened at another BAB party I went to. Me and my husband even pitched in about 30 dollars as we know these things can get expensive. \n\nWe get to the store, and the kids go wild getting their animals and accessories. As far as I know the parents didn\u2019t really put a limit, but I made my daughter stick to just a standard dog with a shirt, which about half the parents did as well. All is well, we leave the store, then friends mom announces that the kids need to give all their animals to her daughter. Cue the upset and angry kids. They all disappointingly handed over their animals, and friend wasn\u2019t even being nice about it either. Another little boy didn\u2019t want to, and friend ripped it out of his hands. I probably should have said something, but I didn\u2019t. The other parents seemed pretty baffled too. \n\nWe get back to friends house and our kids are watching as friend plays with all her new animals. I left with my daughter pretty quickly, and once we got back into the car she just started bawling. I felt bad so we went to build a bear and got her a new one.\n\nI\u2019m just wondering if this is totally normal and I should have expected this, or am I being an entitled parent?",

So I hit the back button and saw another search result page for \"bare breasts\", hit back again and saw another one for \"tits\". His mom and I monitor his browsing history and there was never anything remotely like this.\n\nI immediately started cracking up, because this is a day we knew would come, and started thinking about how I would talk to him about it in the morning.\n\nWhile we were eating breakfast I asked him what that first search was about (the \"My friend told me...\" one), and he said his friend told him that if he searched for that exact term it wouldn't show anything. I said \"oh, really? whats this?\" and showed him the other search results I found.\n\nHe immediately put his head into his arms and started BAWLING. \" I'm sorry!! I'm a bad kid!!\" he starts blabbering. That hurt me, because he's an awesome kid and just would never want to hear anything like that come out of his mouth, but I knew he was just freaking out because he got busted. We stand there for like solid 5 minutes of me just hugging him and calming him down, letting him know it was ok.\n\nI let him know I got caught doing basically the same thing when I was 10 years old, except it was with grampa's magazines. That seemed to mellow him out.\n\nWe still need to have a bigger talk about it later but man, this is as big a day as baby's first steps.",

He said this to our 12 year olds face and left without a backwards glance.\n\nAlso I'm not even in the country at the moment but my husband (my sons stepfather) was luckily there to take him in, give him a cuddle, get him settled into his room and deal with the emotional fall out until I can get home tomorrow.\n\nWe've had a fairly stable custody arrangement for a number of years now after a long period of very difficult coparenting and poor communication (fuelled partly by his family and his lifestyle) so this has been a jolt from the blue as things seemed to be improving and becoming calmer.\n\nI've since tried talking to my ex to establish what's happened and why he's done this but he's claiming that it \"just isn't working out\"\n\nHe's had a new girlfriend for a little under a year, his first serious relationship since we broke up, she's now pregnant (unplanned), due in 3 months and she has two children (younger) from a previous relationship. They moved in together approx 2 months ago.\n\nThat was a lot of upheaval and stress for everyone but it seemed to be going well and our son was excited to see his dad with someone he cared about, liked the kids and was looking forward to being a big brother.\n\nI'm incredibly angry that he has now traumatised our son with his behaviour but I can see similarities between this and how he was when I was pregnant.\n\nWe broke up when our son was only a few months old as my ex wasn't coping with the financial and emotional responsibilities and became violent towards me and I later found out had developed a dependency on alcohol.\n\nWhere do I go from here? \n\nMy sons distraught.",

            "selftext": "I was offered my dream job 18 years ago. I was newly married, wanted to pay off student loans, and get a nice place with my wife. I couldn't turn it down. We had our first child 3 years later and I realized that while this job took a lot of my time, I would be able to afford so many amazing opportunities for my son. We moved out of NYC to a nice suburb in a great house zoned for one of the best districts in the state. We had our twins 2.5 years later. The kids are 15 and 12 now. \n\nThe downside of this job is that it takes a lot of my time. I work at least 60 hours a week and work 6 days a week. By the time I get home it's dinner time and I get filled in about the day from my wife. I have missed my son making varsity lacrosse as a freshman. He didn't even tell me. I found out from my wife. I missed so many games, concerts, spelling bees, and small moments that you can't get back. The kids walk right passed me to ask mom questions. My son went to my wife when he was thinking about asking a girl to homecoming. I have tried talking to him about sex and he tells me that mom already handled it, which is good because I don't even know what to say. This evening was hard. I got back from work and asked one of the twins how her track meet went. She told me that I would know if I went. Her brothers agreed. \n\nI'm going to try my hardest to get back to being a good dad but I wanted to warn the new parents out there who are busting their ass for their families. Kids care about who is there. My kids won't have to spend a dime for college tuition or room and board, but they don't get to have their dad cheering for them either. I can't exactly cut back hours. That isn't how it works in my field. Don't go into something that will prevent you from being able to be there for your kids.",

Is he having trouble at school?  Is he bullied?  Does he get in trouble?  Is he using drugs or drinking?  Does he have any stressors at home?  Does he have any medical conditions?  Has his behaviour changed?  Has he ever talked about hurting himself?\nNo.  None of this.  Nothing, *nothing* in his behaviour gave me any indication, at all, that he planned something like this.  In the span of five minutes he went from making a joke with his dad to wrapping a strap around a basement rafter and then his neck.  I wasn\u2019t home.  His dad was about to leave for work, and for some reason instead of just shouting his goodbye as he sometimes does, when he is leaving for night shift and I am on my way home from the day, he went down to see where he was.  That\u2019s why he is alive now.  \nHe was admitted to a children\u2019s hospital with a mental health inpatient unit.  I still have no answers.  I only know how empty and lost and terrified I feel, and how ineffective I felt trying to hold my composure and talk to the triage nurse, in my scrubs, because I\u2019m a nurse too.  I\u2019m a nurse, and I\u2019m his mother, and I have no idea how this happened.  I have no idea how we got here in an instant, with no warning signs... signs I have been trained to look for.  The signs I see now are angry red welts across his pale neck, where the medical professionals\u2019 eyes all flickered, one after another.  I can\u2019t keep mine from them either.  \nMy beautiful kid with the sandy hair, and face full of freckles, and eyes the colour of the sky early in the morning, was almost erased and I don\u2019t know why.  My kid with the nice group of friends, and teachers that like him, and average grades, and mom that stayed at home with him until recently, and stable family with both his parents, and older brother who is his best friend, almost vanished to me, forever, and I would never have known what it was that I failed to do to keep him safe inside his own head.  I don\u2019t know what explanation I could hear that would make this make sense.  I don\u2019t know how he got here, just 13 years, 10 months, and 4 days into his life.  I don\u2019t know how I am going to ever be able to look away from him ever again.",

She said that occasional tantrums in toddlers are normal (5 is not a toddler, but my daughter is small so sometimes people forget, though we reminded her). They\u2019re not occasional, though. Having less than half a dozen tantrums per day is considered a good day for her. The doctor said it\u2019s probably a phase, but we\u2019ve been stuck on this phase for years. (And even as a toddler, the tantrums and meltdowns were beyond what was normal.)\n\nWhen she\u2019s not having meltdowns, she still commands so much of my attention. She chatters nonstop and isn\u2019t the type to engage in independent play much.\n\nI\u2019m tired and emotionally spent. I\u2019m not able to give my older child as much attention as he deserves, and forget about being on top of things around the house. She\u2019s at preschool now, and I have a couple of hours to get some chores done before I leave to pick her up. Getting her out the door was a huge problem since she didn\u2019t want to get dressed. (She didn\u2019t want to get dressed, but wanted to go to preschool but didn\u2019t want to go in her pajamas or naked. Yeah.) I wanted to vent a little before I go about my day.",

Our kids are in school full time so childcare is a cluster fuck of pick ups and drop  offs, before and after school clubs, home involves me and my wife passing like ships in the night, trying to make something edible and healthy for dinner. Then falling asleep in front of the TV having barely talked to one another, or burying her face in her phone.\n\nNeedless to say the intimacy has dwindled substantially and I can't blame her or myself as we are basically shattered, we make no time for one another and it kind of feels like two business partners who decided to have children, I sometimes wonder if she is cheating on me and the horrible thing is I don't know if I would blame her or that I would even care. I am so sexually frustrated that it feels like my brain is in a fog and I can't think straight. I am constantly on edge it seems and stuck in this depressive cycle of saying to myself \"I'm going to do better tomorrow, I'm going to sort my behaviour out, be more positive, engaged but it never happens, I have zero patience with anything I snap at the smallest things, I have screamed in my four year Olds face!! FOUR!! what the fuck is wrong with me......it's like I am in self destruct mode, or subconsciously want it all to be over. I can't wait sometimes to get them off to bed or have days where they are at school and my wife is at work so I can Just be on my own.\n\nI feel like an empty shell, an androdgenous, sexless drone who purely functions to provide, I am so tired all the time, I am failing my children. I try so hard to teach them respect and manners and how to look after their belongings but it seems like I'm pissing in the wind as nothing sinks in like talking to a brick wall and the cycle just continues endlessly until I lose my temper and it all ends in tears. I love my wife and I love my children but sometimes I think they would genuinely be happier if I wasn't around. The hardest thing is I genuinely believed I would be so awesome at being a dad but I fucking suck at it. \n\nThe modern world is shit, having a crippling mortgage is shit, chasing the carrot is shit, the whole system is shit, \n\nI'm gonna be better tomorrow...\n\nIf anything in this non coherent rambling of a lunatic makes sense then thankyou for reading.\n\n",

            "selftext": "My wife, my 2.5 yr old son, and I are in the market for our first home. We just finished a huge fight because she wants to send our son to poorly rated school in order to buy a nicer house. I know test scores aren\u2019t everything, but this school, and others she\u2019s mentioned, performed in the bottom 10% of elementary schools in KENTUCKY. That\u2019s pretty fucking bad. They also sit in the bottom 10% in progress. I haven\u2019t said this, but I think she\u2019s being really selfish and I think she blew up at me today because she knows it. I couldn\u2019t care less about the house I live in. I just want it to keep my stuff dry, be safe, and have enough resale value to get my money back if I have to jet. I even said, \u201cThis doesn\u2019t have to be permanent. We can buy a house, aggressively pay down the principal, rennovate it over time, then try to upgrade to nicer place when we have some equity built into it.\u201d But that\u2019s not good enough. She says that elementary school doesn\u2019t matter all that much and that we can supplement going to one of the worst schools in one of the worst states for education. I think elementary school is the most important section of an academic career. Plus, it\u2019s going to be his whole life for 6 or 7 years. My son didn\u2019t ask to be born. We made him without any consent. He deserves better than that. I at least want him to go to a school that is just average. Am I wrong here? Obviously, this is one side of the story, but fuck if I\u2019m not tired of this shit. \n\nTL;DR Wife wants to send 2.5 yr old son to a crap elementary school so we can afford a bigger and better house.

            "selftext": "Throwaway because I\u2019m humiliated on top of all the other emotions I\u2019m feeling today. \n\nSo I stay at home with my daughter, who is three. Her dad is working nights today. He left the house at 3:20 or so. After he left, we had some \u201cquiet time\u201d that involved watching Frozen and having a snack. \n\nNow I just found out I\u2019m pregnant again and the nausea and fatigue just started hitting me hard. I knew I would probably fall asleep but my daughter was preoccupied by her goldfish and movie so I figured it could hurt. She\u2019s usually really loud so I knew she wouldn\u2019t let me sleep for long.  At 3:54 I laid down and my daughter said \u201cwake up!\u201d And I told her \u201c6 more minutes of quiet time and then we can play\u201d. \n\nSome time later I wake up and my front door is wide open. The doorknob was locked, so I must have tried to lock the door and then not shut it all the way.\n\nI ran outside and looked up and down my street. The neighbor across the street asked if everything was Ok and I told her I was looking for my daughter but maybe she was actually inside so I was gonna go check. She said ok, that she would start looking around outside. I went back in and looked all around the house because my daughter isn\u2019t really a \u201crunner\u201d and I could easily see how she might try to go outside but then change her mind and go play in the bathroom or something. But no, she wasn\u2019t inside.\n\nI ran back outside and a group of my neighbors about half a block down are walking towards me, holding my daughter. I ran towards them and thanked the woman holding my kid, even gave her a hug. I told the woman I had just ran upstairs to get something (why did I lie?) and she disappeared. She said it\u2019s alright, it happened to her brother growing up. I thanked her and went home. \n\nWhen we got home I figured out from watching my security footage that she walked out the door at 3:57, three minutes after I dozed off, and I found her and came back inside at 4:13. She was gone for 16 whole minutes. Not only that but she carried a little chair outside with her, which I am now too embarrassed to go look for. \n\nI had a talk with her about going outside that I\u2019m not sure she comprehended. But she knew I was upset and put herself in timeout, I told her she didn\u2019t have to. \n\nI don\u2019t really know how to get over this. I\u2019m deeply upset and embarrassed. Not to mention that I\u2019m sure my husband isn\u2019t going to trust me now. Thanks for letting me get this off my chest\n\n",

I do my best to be a good mom, we spend a lot of time together since I am a mostly stay at home mom, not by choice and it may be changing soon, hopefully. We play, I had to her, we spend a lot of time outside I try and teach her stuff and really be present. But I hate it.

I miss my old life, I miss just going out, I miss being able to pick up shifts at work whenever because we didn't have to worry about child care. I miss being able to be spontaneous with my husband. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hear it gets better, and it has to an extent.

I love my grandson with all of my heart and offered to babysit them for free. Both work as teachers and make a decent living but we live in a high cost of living area and daycare would be a big financial burden. I love babysitting but my DIL has a lot of rules and restrictions. I am fine with following most of them even if I don't agree but the biggest ones I have trouble with is that she doesn't believe in saying \"no\", using any kind of discipline other than natural consequences, I can't leave him alone even in his crib to go to the bathroom because she needs him to be supervised by me at all times, I can only take him outside in certain temps, and I can't listen to music or watch TV the entire time he's hear because she doesn't want him to hear anything he shouldn't. It's not as if I am listening to NWA or watching the Walking Dead, mind you. She doesn't like not being able to control \"his input.\" \n\nI am getting to my breaking point. My husband works and I stay at home. I have two teens (ages: 17 and 14), one with special needs but neither needs my undevoted attention at this point, and I figured babysitting would be a nice way to help them out while also keeping me busy. I'm not sure that I can keep doing this but am afraid of my DIL and son not having someone to watch their baby or them not wanting me around anymore since I put them in a bad spot. I have talked to my son and DIL about the restrictions but my DIL doesn't want to ease up. I can respect that these are important to her but I don't like how things are right now. Am I a bad grandma if I don't want to watch him anymore?\n",

For anyone outside my life following my wife on Facebook, i cannot complain. She post the most adorable photo of us smiling, making cookies, setting up the christmas tree all year long. I love my wife and my kids are adorables, I love them deeply but it take EVERYTHING out of me to keep up with them. At the end of the day, I am exhausted and do not have an ounce of patience left to be diplomat, or even socialize properly with my friends online (only way to still socialize these days). I recently cut myself from that community because i couldnt stand their sarcasm and bad jokes. I just lost it, lashed at them and quit. I now feel awfull and regret it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have also come to realise that Facebook and reddit massively contribute to take down my spirit. While i browse endlessly and see other people life and witness on my screen that my kidless friend is currently with his girlfriend in Honduras hiking, or how some random stranger on reddit is sculpting Notre-Dame de Paris from a maple log he found on the beach,  I know that I only see the facade. I know because my own facebook feed is full awesome post that does not reflect the reality, only what I want people to see, to believe. While it is true we actually hiked a mountain my family and I last weekend, what the smily pictures of my 3 kids and wife didnt say is that it was a nightmare. My 3 years old cried all the way ,  my 6 years old ran out of sight everywhere almost falling from a small cliff and my 4 years old just stopped in the middle forcing us to turn back. We cried, we screamed, and 2 hours after that pictures was taken, we were 5 angry people in the car going back at home in silence, while posting on facebook #Funwiththekids #hiking #goodtimes. Why the fuck do we do that?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe live in and era of illusion where everyone is entitle to sell their life better than it actualy is. It was already true before the internet, but i am convince it was never this bad. And while we lied to everyone else, we mostly lie to ourselves. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am addicted to reddit. I cannot pass 3 hours without browsing a little. And each time, I now realise that it make me depress.   While I smile when seeing something funny, or amazed by someone\u2019s talent, it also says to me : You are pathetic, untalented, unfunny. And while i know it is wrong, i cant help it but feel that way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI realised today that i need to cut those sites from my life to start the process to heal. I know I have multiple problems and the majority of them are in my head. But it is still an awfull era to witness. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Originally, when we both went back to work, I was feeling incredibly guilty for not being able to afford at home care.... which I talked to her about on occasion because she was doing home care and I was having a hard time with the transition.  I did diligent research and found the best daycare option for our family.... it\u2019s a KinderCare (which is a chain you may have heard of). It was difficult at first, because of guilty working mom feelings etc, but now that we\u2019re well over the adjustment I literally couldn\u2019t imagine it any other way. My daughter rushes in to see her friends and loves her teachers and never wants to leave! She does daily activities and every week and they send me home with a portfolio of her artwork and I am just so grateful that she has these experiences and that it has worked out so well for us.\nWell, I was visiting with my friend the other day and she\u2019s talking about how it\u2019s getting tough to afford the at-home care, and casually but insensitively mentions how her baby daddy says \u201cwe\u2019re never putting [our baby] in a puppy mill!\u201d. Now, baby daddy who said this is good friends with my husband, and we are the only parents they know who send their child to daycare, so I am having a hard time not finding this as a slight against us as parents. I defended our daycare center, saying how it\u2019s wonderful and we absolutely love it and so does our daughter.... but nothing too much was said about it. \nNow I can\u2019t stop thinking about why she would have said that to me!

My husband and older two were home but obviously not expected to watch a 13 and 10 year old. \n\nThe 13 year old and some friends decided to play a game of dodgeball. They gathered various balls and started playing their game. My son picked up a heavier ball that was picked out by another kid and threw it. It ended up hitting one of the boys in the mouth and knocked out his front tooth. The kids stopped and found the tooth. The boy who was hit went home and told his mom what happened. \n\nFrom what the mother tells me they are hoping that the tooth reattaches naturally but won't know for another few weeks. If it doesn't then he is going to need a dental implant, which can cost a lot of money since they don't have dental insurance. I feel awful, I really do, but I don't think it's fair that we have to pay. He was playing in the game as well and the ball had been thrown multiple times. For me it's simply a case of an unlucky shot. \n\nAre we the assholes? Should we have to pay for this? ",

            "selftext": "My wife and I both work full time and both work odd hours. A few days ago, I had the day off while my wife worked a 12hr shift. Our 4 month old was getting particularly fussy so we went for a walk because he loves being carried and looking around. While we were out, another new parent (a mom) my wife knows stopped me to say hi. I realize her intent was just to be nice but she made a comment that really bothered me. She asked, \"How much longer are you stuck taking care of him?\" Initially I was thrown off by the question and just sort of stared and asked, \"What?\" She then clarified, \"I think it's awesome you're giving your wife a break but how long do you have to watch him until your wife takes him back?\" I politely explained the situation and moved on.\n\nThe reason this bothers me is that it implies that as a dad, I'm just there to keep the kids alive until the real parent, mom, can take back over. First, my wife and I try to share responsibilities but this question assumes I don't do much. Second, this question also subtly undermines my wife implying that if I'm watching our son, she's not doing her job and burdening me. Third, I'm not stuck taking care of my son and don't appreciate the assumption that having a child is something that \"sticks\" the dad. The short answer of how long I'm caring for him is 'forever,' but I wasn't looking to be argumentative. I guarantee that if it was reversed and my wife was walking around with him while I was at work, though, the question wouldn't be how long she is stuck with him. Times have changed. This is no longer parenting when our grandparents or even parents were doing it.\n\nAlso, for context, the person asking me the question is not a stay at home mom, herself. She also works. Further, even if she was a stay at home mom, I'm all for someone staying home to focus on kids, family, house, etc. but that doesn't absolve the working parent of also parenting, too, when at home.\n\nI'm done venting. /End rant.",

            "selftext": "Hi there, I don't normally look here or post here and I'm not sure where else to post this because it's a little more then parenting so if this is too long or breaks some rules then I apologize. I'll try to make this as short as possible.\n\nMy girlfriend (31) and I (27) have been dating for over a year now, she has 4 kids. I've never dated anyone with kids before but she really is a great and wonderful person and I truly love her and want to be with her. I figured I would give it an honest shot and my best effort to step in and do whatever needed to be done to make things work.\n\nHer kids are 4 (boy), 7(girl), 10(boy), and 12(boy). The 4 year old and the 12 year old live with us and the other 2 come every weekend and stay from Friday until Monday (They stay at their real father's house). \n\nAfter living like this for a year I'm seriously thinking about whether or not I should stick around in this relationship, and the problem is I just have a hard time dealing with all the stress of the children. It's a complete asshole thing to say but I really feel like the kids are kind of ruining things at home. I somewhat dread going home after working all day and playing dad and I have so much respect for people that have the energy to do that but I just... Dont anymore? \n\nThe kids honestly aren't bad kids per say, just all of their issues combine into one big mess. Our 4 year old is a goddamn terrorist and hurricane wrapped up into one cute little package. He back talks, is rude and demanding, and has meltdowns and temper tantrums so often we literally have to plan it out so he doesn't go to the store with us because he has a freak out every single time.  I've tried really hard to use lots of positive reinforcement and misdirection (how about we get this toy next time instead) but after what feels like months it just doesn't seem to have any effect at all. It's gotten to the point where I don't want to be around him but of course he needs that love and attention so I just sit there silently grumbling while I watch Paw Patrol again.\n\nHow can I be a good dad when I dread being in the same room as him most of the time?\n\nThe 7 and 10 year old aren't bad either, the 7 year old girl has serious problems taking care of herself, I mean she wont even brush her own hair or pick her own clothes or pour her own cereal. I've tried to teach her how to do all these things by herself and help her do it the right way (brushing hair is a craft I will never perfect) but she seems to not have any interest in helping herself. How do I get her motivated to start doing thing by herself? \n\nThe 12 year old is a whole other can of worms that I could spend all day writing about but suffice to say he lies about homework and school, has a real hard time doing what he is asked the first time, and generally reminds me of the typical teenager stereotype. I try to make an effort with him to spend time to together and do hobbies he likes so we can bond (We play DnD which he likes and is surprisingly fun) but sometimes I feel like he manipulates my trust to avoid getting oit of schoolwork or chores. Any general advice for teenagers that I should know about?\n\nI know I'm being a complainer and I do love these kids, honest to god. There are just so many situations that I feel like I don't know how to handle and its been wearing me down for awhile and I just honestly don't know if I can do this the rest of my life. My girlfriend is perfect for me and she is a rockstar of a mom, she goes above and beyond to help support these kids and is absolutely there all the way. When we do get alone time (very rare, like once or twice a month) it makes me so happy but it doesn't feel right being unhappy 90% of the month and dreading coming home from a job that I hate.\n\nWhat can I do to fix things on my end? I feel like maybe if I was a better dad I could handle certain situations better and then the kids wouldn't drive me so crazy.\n\nTl;dr First time Stepdad has four kids now, they all drive me crazy and I'm not sure how to make myself happy so can make them happy.",

            "selftext": "My 5th grader is on the high functioning end of the autism spectrum. This is his second year in the gifted and talented program and he loves it. He has made 3 quirky friends, which may not sound like a big deal but his birthday parties from kindergarten through 3rd grade were family only because he knew no one would come. \n\nThe 5th grade has a field trip every year. It's 3 days away doing fun activities like ziplining, rock climbing, hiking, and things of that nature. My son wasn't sure about going at first because new things make him nervous but my older kids convinced him to go and he's excited about it. He went to all of the meetings and the last meeting was where they had to finalize their groups. They sleep in a cabin and there are 4 boys to a room. None of my son's friends are going on the trip because of other issues (one has sensory issues and hates the outdoors, another has autism and OCD, and the other has a mom who doesn't feel comfortable with her son going if she can't chaperone because he has meltdowns) but my son put himself out there and found a group. Two of the three boys are friends with my older son because they have played flag football and baseball together, so it was probably a pity invite but my son didn't care. He had a room with kids he knew would be nice to him because of his brother. During the meeting these two boys told my son that he couldn't be in their room anymore because the 3rd kids best friend decided to join their group instead. My son said \"okay\" and searched for other groups. When he couldn't find one he told the coordinators that he didn't have a group and they called up the kids who only had 3 people in their groups. There were 2 groups of boys that only had 3 people and all 6 of the boys said they didn't want to share with my son. From what my son says the teacher tried to convince them but they all said that he was weird and they didn't want him in their rooms. \n\nMy son was told that he can not attend this trip because he does not have a group to room with even though their are two beds on the boys side not being used. There is room but those boys don't want to share with him. My son suggested sleeping in a sleeping bag in the room of the two boys who invited him to join their group originally but was told that wasn't allowed because the maximum is 4 to a room. \n\nMy son is extremely disappointed. He is such a shy kid and for him to find a group, get kicked out, go searching for another group, tell the coordinators that he didn't have a group, get turned down by 6 boys who all said he was weird, try to come up with another solution, and continuously get rejected showed a lot from him. In the past he would have just left the room when it became overwhelming but he wants this bad and was willing to fight for it. \n\nI want this for him. It's a trip that my older two kids still talk about and I know he would enjoy it. He had a group and planned ahead. He was told last minute that his group dropped him in favor of another kid who came in last minute. Their are spaces available and we already paid. The school offered a full refund. Should I just take the refund and shut up? I know this may not seem like a big deal and we could do something similar but it was a way for him to experience something with his classmates. I don't know how many more of those opportunities he will have and he really wanted this one bad. Am I overreacting or should I go to the school about this?\n\n",

            "selftext": "My husband never works during the winter months every year. Since he is home he sleeps in everyday until 1/2pm. He stays up late until 3/4am watching movies. I'm a stay at home mom but everyday I'm up at 6:30am until midnight. On weekends I ask my husband if it's possible he can watch the kids (18 months and 7 year old) so I can sleep in. Everytime I ask he says \"oh I didn't sleep last night I'm tired, I need to sleep today\". Or if I wake him up during the week earlier than 1/2pm he'll count that as \"waking up really early\" so weekend comes and I am not allowed to sleep in. We've had this battle since our 7 year old was little and I just started going to sleep really early so come morning I wouldn't be tired or ask my husband for help because when he shuts me down it invigorates me. We are both parents who should contribute equally so if I'm begging to sleep in for an extra hour or two on a weekend morning am I except once in a while to be allowed such luxury. It just drives me nuts that I'm obligated to constantly wake up early but he can sleep until he feels content to wake up which I don't even know what that feels like. I almost lost my mind from sleep deprivation when our youngest was a baby and still he wouldn't take some responsibility and let me sleep. Some days I can't sleep and it's hard to get out of bed but I do because my kids come first. My husband has no idea what the is like and it enrages me that he is supposed to have this lax lifestyle while I do absolutely everything else. If I ask to sleep in for an hour, why does that have to start a fight? Why can't he for ONCE say \"sure you can sleep in this time, no hard feelings I got this!\"? I think he knows that if he causes tension I will back off as to not cause issues in front of the kids but it drives me insane. If I sleep early, he and I won't get our alone time but that is the only way I can preserve my sanity by waking up early and feeling okay.  Ideally I'd love if Saturday/Sunday was my day to look forward to and know that I can relax that morning. My version of sleeping in is until 10/11am not 1/2pm like him. I just hate how he can't suck it up and do something for someone other than himself, but he would rather start an argument in front of our kids in order to get out of it and get what he wants. I literally NEVER get what I want or to truly relax. If only we could switch places for a week maybe he would understand the life of a mom. Sorry for the long rant. I guess I'm wondering how other parents handle sleeping in (if they do at all?) Do you alternate? Do dad's offer to help get kids to school some days or is it SAHM's job regardless? Any advice?\n\nThanks! ",

Turned out he had a 100+ degree fever, was coughing and was visibly drained of energy.  I asked my wife what was wrong and she said he was sick, I commented that he looked pretty bad and was surprised he wasn\u2019t well enough to even play his favorite Lego game.   She said something to the effect of \u201cOh, I know, he won\u2019t even get off the couch\u201d and then she turned to his direction as says \u201cYou\u2019ve got a man cold buddy\u201d.  My son is insatiably curious and asked what that was, before I could attempt to dismiss it my wife explains that (and I\u2019m paraphrasing here) \u201cIt\u2019s the same cold a woman gets but when men get it they can\u2019t handle it, thy cry and complain until they get better.\u201d\n\nMy son didn\u2019t quite understand and asked if that means if boys should be more scared of getting colds than girls.  I simply brushed it off and explained to him it\u2019s a generalization that isn\u2019t fair (not in those words exactly, since he\u2019s six), and not to worry.\n\nHe\u2019s still sick today (next day) and is saying he has a man cold.  Do I simply let it dissolve and be forgotten?  Or do I confront my wife about it and explain we have to be careful about what we say?  I\u2019m so torn, half of me is saying \u201cdude, it\u2019s a funny joke and your wife does have to deal with more as a mom when she has a cold\u201d but the other half is thinking \u201coh man, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair to man to generalize them as weaker than women when it comes to sickness\u201d.\n\nI know I\u2019m already over thinking this, so any advice on what to do, including \u201cforget about it you\u2019re being an obsessive crazy person\u201d would be really appreciated.",

            "selftext": "Today is my birthday. I requested the day off from work. Last week was Valentine's day. I co-parent with a Disneyland dad. We have been separated since our child was 2 months old. She is now 14.\n\nMy ex re-married and his wife recently left him due to his selfishness and lack of concern when raising our child (mix in random alcohol abuse also).\n\nAll our daughter's life she has been handed everything she wants. She has been given money for shopping sprees and never lifts a finger over at dad's house. We are talking iPhones, internet, Netflix, designer makeup, and more.\n\nThis has always caused conflict. I tried to get us into parenting classes (court ordered) but the judge saw nothing wrong with his parenting and dismissed this last month.\n\nMoving on. She wanted me to take her shopping for her boyfriend for Valentine's Day. We went to the mall and she spent her money left from Christmas. When that money was spent, she was finished. This caused her to become angry and throw statements at me like \"I wish you were more like dad\" and she pouted. I don't like going shopping with her ever since she expects everything to be handed over.\n\nI did text her father and told him she was able to purchase chocolate and a card. I explained I am teaching her money and she should probably work part-time this summer with a work permit. I thought this was fair. He thanked me for taking her which was weird.\n\nThey both decided this was not enough. He handed her $50 to go purchase more gifts because that's how he parents. I can't change him. I have tried. For 10 years I have tried to reason with him to help him see this shows her nothing in life needs to be earned. He dropped her off at the mall with cash in hand.\n\nWhen she came home from his house last night, I told her I had requested work off today. She pouted because she has school off and said I will be \"in her way\". She had no idea it was my birthday until I had to ask her \"do you know what tomorrow is?\". She still had no clue. I always buy my ex a birthday card (come on, they are a dollar) out of respect for our child. He can not be bothered.\n\nI sat her down and told her I am not upset but that I expect her to put importance on certain dates. She actually said to me \"What do you want me to buy you and it will have to wait until I can get more money off dad\".\n\nThat resulted in an entirely different discussion about how I don't want anything bought with my exes money.\n\nAll I requested is that she do the dishes today. This resulted in another \"dad never makes me do the dishes, this is so unfair!\" argument.\n\nWhen she is 18, she can go live in his basement. I give up. \n\nThanks for letting me rant. ",

            "selftext": "This happened on Friday. I came home from work to find my wife in a panic. She had called me over 37 times, I had my ringer off so I didn't hear the calls. She screamed in my face that she caught our fourteen year old daughter having sex with our neighbors' son, also the same age. I had suspected for a while that they were sneaking around as a couple due to some encounters in recent months. I wasn't aware that it had reached that point, however.\n\nMy wife told me she banned him from our house, and is planning to press sexual assault charges on him, and for statutory rape. I tell her, \"Please, calm down. Honey, teenagers have sex and experiment...\" Now I am speaking from persona experience, as I had my first time at around fourteen myself. Well, my wife goes ballistic and begins to scream at me that I am condoning harm on our child. I try to rationally explain to her my side of the \"debate\", and I remind her that she is likely going to ruin both of these kids' lives over something that was normal and consensual. I wanted to go talk to my daughter about birth control, my wife blocked me. I begin to loudly argue about this with her until she proceeded to throw me out of the house.\n\nI spent the night at a Motel 6. I tried calling my daughter, but no answer. I return on Saturday morning to an empty house. I wait all day, and in the evening, my wife returns with our daughter in tears. Apparently my wife took her to the hospital to get a vaginal exam done, and my daughter felt antagonized and embarrassed. I told her she went too far. We argue some more, this time in front of our daughter. \n\nTo make a long story short, we're all miserable right now. I am very angry at my wife, I can't believe she overreacted in this way. I feel like our daughter is more traumatized over her actions than over the alleged \"sexual assault\" she had. I managed to talk to her finally this morning, and my daughter confirmed that everything had been consensual, and that she had used protection (they used condoms and vaginal gel). They had also had sex three times before my wife caught them. \n\nI have no idea what to do. I'm afraid of my wife messing up my daughter's life. And honestly, I think the neighbors' son is a good kid. He doesn't deserve to get dragged through the mud like this. As someone who had his parents ban him from dating a girlfriend in high school, I can attest how devastating this can be for a teenager. \n\nWhat do I do? What advice can you all give me here?",

            "selftext": "I am going on just a few hours sleep, as this happened last night. So, forgive me if I ramble.\n\nLast night I was changing my 5 month old daughter. When I took her footy pajamas off I was cleaning her feet off from lint. I noticed that there was something wrapped around on of her toes. Most likely hair. I was trying to get it off when it started cutting into her skin. I was freaking. I couldn't get it off. \n  \nWe called 911. After 20 minutes they show up. They couldn't get it off. It cut too deep. They EMTs were nice, but they had nothing with them to help. I had to supply my own tweezers. Honestly, calling 911 was a waste of time.  \n  \nSo, I bundled her up and drove to the local children's hospital. We were fast tracked through triage, and given a bed in the hallway. This is normal for the children's hospital emergency room at night. \n \nWe final saw a doctor after 20 minutes. She told me they have gel they use to melt the hair, and its better than cutting. I rather my baby not get cut if she doesn't need it.  \n  \nSo the nurse comes back to treat my baby. She's putting the gel on, and getting it everywhere. I notice a familiar smell. It's nair! They are putting nair on her foot. It's not the pink goop. It looks like blue hair gel. It says 'no scent', but I can smell the nair scent, strong.\n  \nI ask if it ok to put on her foot with the open wound. The nurse, who was really nice, but didn't exude confidence that she knew what she was doing, said that it was cool gel, and should be fine.\n  \nAfter 10 minutes of waiting, the nurse comes to check. So far didn't work. The toe was still red. She started to get ready to put more gel. I made a comment that I didn't think it was working. The nurse turns around, and quickly starts to leave saying, \"I'll let the doctor know you're refusing treatment.\"  \n  \nI told her, I'm not refusing, just not sure. She noped her way out of there saying, I need to let the doctor know. 10 minutes later, the doctor comes back and tells me that they want to try this again, because the next step is to cut into her toe to cut the hair. I'm like, ok, I don't want her getting cut if she doesn't need it. So, they put nair on her foot again. My baby is screaming. Her toe is bleeding. Her mom is texting me wanting to know what's going on, and I'm standing there, dying inside, because I can't protect my little girl. I've never felt more like a loser than just then.  \n  \nIt was at least 15 minutes before they cleaned the nair off. The doctor came to clean her foot herself. She says that the hair is gone. I can't tell. The toe looks a little better. What I can see are bad chemical burns from the nair. It ate away at skin on the top of her foot. Blood was just seeping out of the wound. The pad of the toe where the prints are was half eaten off. Her foot has red burns.  \n \nI am furious and exhausted. Am I overreacting?\n\n\nAlso, check the toes everytime you change your baby. Maybe I could have seen it sooner. ",

            "selftext": "I have 5 kids. My husband and I had 3 boys and decided to have a fourth. We were NOT trying for a girl like a lot of people think. We always knew we wanted 3 or 4 kids. We ended up pregnant with twins and found out during the pregnancy that we would be having a boy and a girl. \n\nSome backstory: My husband was one of 4 boys but his mom always wanted a girl. His younger brother passed away in college. My husband's oldest brother has 2 sons and his next older brother doesn't have any kids nor does he plan too. He still lives with the parents and is probably on the spectrum but was never formally diagnosed. My MIL is super feminine and was looking forward to having granddaughters since she never had a daughter. \n\nWe did a gender reveal. We are a baseball family so we had one of our boys pitch, one playing catcher, and one hitting the ball. The first ball exploded blue and everyone was happy. The second one exploded pink and everyone went crazy. My MIL and SIL spent the whole pregnancy buying things for my daughter but nothing for my son since we could use hand me downs. We were planning on using hand me downs for both kids but MIL wasn't having that. \n\nI gave birth to the twins last year and again, all anyone focused on was my daughter. It's been that way ever since she was born. MIL and SIL stop by to see our daughter but ignore her twin and the other boys. They bring gifts just for our daughter. The only time they talk to the boys is to tell them that they need to protect her and make jokes that she'll never be able to date with all of her \"body guards.\" \n\nMy husband doesn't see the big deal and shrugs it off because he doesn't think the boys need as much attention since they are boys. He says that presents and attention are things girls care about but boys don't. He isn't worried and said he knows that his mom always wanted a daughter. He's not upset by that. It just pains me to see my boys ask why grandma and aunty only care about their sister. I tell them that it's because she's a baby but they have said that she doesn't give their baby brother the same attention. If they can see it, I know my youngest son will notice how much differently he is treated than his twin. \n\nDo I hope this gets better and not say anything? We live 5 minutes from them so they stop by a lot. Will this die down as they get more used to her?",

I have never in my life been so judged and held under a microscope! Why do other moms have to be so judgmental and mean? What does it accomplish? I have no clue. \nI guess this is more of a rant. Like I am sorry Karen, I didn\u2019t breastfeed till my kid was four and I don\u2019t cosleep anymore. Heaven forbid if I give my kid a French fry, I am old and tired. I don\u2019t have time to feed my kids free range,gluten free,nut free, cage free, hormone free and vegan food. I feed my kids relatively healthy and we are definitely active.  We are healthy without all the weird oils and supplements. Besides, gluten free, sugar free cake is ridiculous.

She\u2019s been pretty good the past couple months, but now that out daughter is 4 months old, my wife is getting worse. \n\nExample: tonight, she was lying in bed, right on the edge of sleep. I got the baby down in her crib (which is in our bedroom), when my wife suddenly says \u201clemme ask you a question. What was that game we played with the chairs and music and running around?\u201d  I responded \u201cmusical chairs?\u201d She started singing Frere Jacques at the top of her lungs \u201cNo! It was the one with the chairs and this song!\u201d \n\nObviously the baby is awake at this point, screaming and crying. It takes another 30 minutes of cooing to get her down again. \n\nEpisodes like this occur a few times a week. \n\nHow do I delicately tell my wife that she\u2019s a raging idiot at night and she needs to sleep elsewhere?",

            "selftext": "My husband and I have four kids. A 14 year old girl, 12 year old boy, 2 year old boy, and 5 month old girl. We have a 4 bedroom house. The older two sleep on the same level in separate bedrooms across from each other. The toddler sleeps in one of the downstairs bedrooms and we room share with the baby in the room across from him.\n\nMy 12 year old (13 in March) is a good kid. He plays hockey and baseball. He gets straight As. He has a lot of friends and goes to sleepovers. Very average preteen boy things. He is open and talks to us a lot.\n\nAbout 3 weeks ago he started coming into our bedroom in the middle of the night asking if he could sleep on the floor in our room. It was late and we didn't ask why. We told him he could. It was probably a mistake because this has been happening over and over again. We told him no and he got very angry. He started yelling and asked if we cared about him. We both got up and had a conversation with him about it. He said that he's been having bad dreams lately and just feels more comfortable sleeping with us. He said he can't remember the dreams but wakes up scared in the middle of the night. That is when he comes downstairs. We have tried getting him a nightlight and leaving the door open. His sister has been leaving her door open with her light on as well. We have let him leave his light on. We have tried white noise.\n\nAt this point I don't know what else to do. Do we take him to the doctor? He seems to get bad anxiety when we tell him no and its not in a way I have ever seen before. We tell him no all the time and he accepts it, even if he sometimes pushes, but this is different. It's like he is genuinely and truly afraid of something but he can't explain what.\n\nHe is a normal boy during the day. Laughing and joking around. He had friends over last night and was doing great. He went to his bed to go to sleep but woke up in the middle of the night and came to our room. We reached out to his teachers this week (without revealing details) and they say he's fine at school. His hockey coach couldn't think of any issues.",

The serious sleep deprivation, the crying, the holding, the chaos, the mess, the constant appointments, and the multi-year prison sentence.

My wife, on the other hand, loves everything about it and cannot envision a life without these twins.\n\nIn the end, I overestimated my abilities and my wife underestimated hers.",

            "selftext": "Writing this on a throwaway account since I know my son is on reddit.\n\nThe long and short of it is that my son came out to me and my wife and my wife took it extremely badly. And I don't know how to handle either one of them although for completely different reasons. \n\nBasically here's how things happened. Wednesday, when I came home from work my son said he had something to tell me. He was obviously fidgety about something, and after abit of rambling he eventually told me he was gay. To be honest, I already knew. He's a good kid and pretty damn smart, but I'm a programmer and therefore the 'computer guy', I'm \nthe one that everyone calls to fix their computers and laptop. So without drawing a picture, I already knew he was gay. \n\nSo when he finally came out to me, I was actually kind of relieved. He and I have always had a good relationship but he never told me and I was kind of wondering if maybe we didn't have such a good relationship. In any case, I did the dad thing of telling him that I loved him and all I really wanted from him was for him to be safe and happy. He was just really relieved I guess. \n\nAnyway he asked me to be there when he told his mother, which now that I think about it is probably why he came to me first. Now, she is a deeply religious woman. She wasn't always but somewhere along the line she turned\nfrom being just somewhat religious to being deeply deeply devout and if I'm being honest, I couldn't really pin down when or how that happened. I'm not religious in the slightest although I do do the occasional church-going and church-related functions to make her happy.\n\nAnyway when she got home I waited for my son to take the lead on when to tell her. Its when he told her that things went to hell. I don't think she really believed it at first, probably thought it was some kind of joke or something but when she realized it wasn't, first started crying and then went into what I can only call a rage. He tried to calm her down and I tried to help to get her to not see this as the end of the world. But she kept going on\nabout how this wasn't the plan for him and about grandkids and a bunch of other things. But she just kept working herself into some kind of frenzy.\n\nEventually she went to his room and starts dumping his clothes and tells him to get out of the house. My son is bawling at this point, and I just completely flip out. I order him \nto go to my bedroom and stay in there. And I just unleash on her. I pretty much say what kind of mother is she and that\nI'll be 3 weeks dead and buried before I let him leave and she gets angry at me for backing her up on this and that being gay is wrong and bunch of other bullshit. Anyway, after a hell of a heated fight she leaves and goes to stay at her parents. \n\nI try talking to my son, he's just devastated and blaming himself for everything. And I'm not sure what to do here. I let my son skip school the last couple of days as a kind of mental health day although I let him know that he will go back on Monday. I haven't spoken to my wife since that night, and I'm not even surewhat I could or should say to her, and I'm not sure how to handle my son either. He's not the usual self and I don't know how to get him to stop blaming himself. He says he wants to spend the night at a friend's house which is fine, I figure his friends can offer different kinds of support than I can. But I'm at a complete loss. I think I did my best although writing this I realized that since I knew he was gay for awhile I should tried to slowly ease her into the idea to make this less explosive or maybe if I stayed calm earlier I could have handled it less emotionally. I just don't where to go from here or how to handle any of this.\n\n\n",

Sometimes way before puberty. \n\nMy oldest is 7 and isn't smelly yet but we have started talking about proper hygiene.

            "selftext": "My daughter has severe, non verbal autism. She\u2019s not potty trained, she isn\u2019t very loving, and we have taken to giving her the nickname \u201c(Name) the Destroyer\u201d as a joke when it\u2019s only her step dad and I. \n\nI knew from the time she was six months old that she was \u201cdifferent\u201d. She was never a cuddly baby, always preferred to not be held or cuddled, and never really smiled. Her bio dad, my ex husband, is an autism specialist and I guess he just wanted to believe that our little girl didn\u2019t have Autism. I rallied for her to be tested as soon as she possibly could, especially when she didn\u2019t start walking till she was well over 2. I remember the day we got the diagnosis- he and I were already divorced, but we both grieved at what we found out.\n\nNot only does she have Autism, she is also extremely delayed in every single area of development. Initially, we thought it would be best if she lived with him during the week and me on the weekends; he is more capable of giving her the help and skills she needs, he\u2019s trained, he knows what to say to the therapists. But, he decided that he\u2019d rather have a social life, a new marriage with neuro typical children, and not have the daily fight of trying to make some semblance of normal. Eventually, he warmed up more and decided to at least keep her every weekend.\n\nSo, here I am. I have three other kids besides her- my oldest who is three years older, my step son who is a year older, and my youngest I was pregnant with before we knew how bad off my daughter is.  I\u2019m a stay at home mom, my SO is the breadwinner. I did have a career- I was an in home/facility caregiver for end of life and dementia.  \n\nI start my day at five AM, I wake up and get stuff together for my SO. I get my oldest showered and dressed and on the bus, I make breakfast for my SS and let him eat while I go to my daughters room and start the daily chore of stripping her sheets, cleaning up stuff that would make the strongest stomach churn, and I shower her to get poop out of her hair and off of her body. A shower usually triggers screaming because of sensory issues, so my youngest usually wakes up screaming because her older sister is screaming. I get her dressed, get the youngest changed and then feed them both breakfast.\n\nAfter that, is play time. I have only gone one day of a cup not being spilled out, her not hurting her siblings or destroying *something*.  She then over stems, attacks me or herself (this happens once a day, no matter what I do)\n\nThen is snack. She pours it on the ground, steals things off of her siblings plate, and kicks me or them. She\u2019s a big girl, so it hurts. A lot. She actually fractured my rib about a month ago.\n \nThen, she poops again and kicks and screams as I change her. I get her down for nap, sometimes she sleeps. Usually she just screams and breaks stuff. \n\nShe gets up, I clean everything up again and then we do exercises that will help with her development.  It\u2019s really doing nothing, but hope springs eternal. \n\nThen lunch. I hate, loathe, and despise lunch time. I have yet to have breakfast by this point, so I try to make something for myself. She decides she wants it, and then throws it on the ground or tears it apart. She then picks a fight with my stepson, breaks something, or just does something awful. \n\nThen is more play time while my youngest takes her nap.  We go outside, I usually stop her from running away or trying to run into traffic. \n\nWe go back inside, have quiet time with tablets. I get to listen to Elmo say the same letter over, and over, and over again. Sometimes, she lets out a shrill sound that sounds vaguely like a laugh. Mostly, it\u2019s just pretty loud and ear splitting.  \n\nBy four, my oldest is home and youngest is up. They all play, have another snack. SSDD.\nMy SO gets home, I go outside and have a cigarette and cry for about ten minutes. I\u2019m on anti depressants and Valium, but that does very little.  We give her 3.5 milligrams of melatonin, feed her dinner, and then she usually passes out. \nI spend time with the other kids, give them more attention. My SO and I get them put down, and the I begin cleaning. Sometime around 10-11 pm, I fall into bed after a shower and dread waking up the next morning. \n\nI get a 45 minute break every Tuesday though! When she\u2019s in therapy.\n\nI love my daughter. I love her so fiercely and deeply that it hurts. I love her in that deeply primal way that only a mother can love. \n\nBut this is not the life I wanted. I would sell my soul to the Devil and swim through a lake of hypodermic needles for all of eternity if I could change her. I would do *anything* not to make her like this. \n\nEvery.Single.Time. Someone says to me \u201cOh, she must be so interesting!\u201d/ \u201cAutism is a gift!\u201d/\u201cRainman is (insert bullshit here)\u201d I want to choke the life out of them. They have no idea.\n\nPlease, please, please stop making this seem like something so amazing. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s fucking awful.\n\nShe\u2019s four now, but she won\u2019t always be. Society is fucking *ugly* in how they treat people who a different. She\u2019s never going to be able to live on her own, she\u2019s never going to have a job, go to college, get married, have a normal life.  And I refuse to make her siblings be her caretakers- they deserve to have a happy, normal life. \n\nInstead of planning for college, I\u2019m trying to figure out how we will pay for longterm care after I am dead.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for ranting. I had to get it out, or I felt like I was going to break. I realize this is just caregiver fatigue, and I\u2019m just stressed past the point of comprehension.   This will pass and I\u2019m just weak today. She kicked me in the jaw and broke one of my molars yesterday, so I think being in pain just has me down.",

My son and I spend a lot of time together.\n\nYesterday we were going to visit my husband's grandmother in the hospital that was 2 hours away. My son was going to spend the day with my mom because a toddler doesn't need to be at a hospital all day and I also wanted a small break.\n\nThat didn't happen. My husband missed the exit for my parents' house, got irritated, and decided to just bring him with us to the hospital. I was irritated because my parents were expecting us, we were late, and now I am stuck at a hospital all day with a toddler, so I get to be the one to deal with that while husband gets to relax in a chair and visit.\n\nWe get an hour into the trip and husband says \"why do you hate our son?\". \n\nThe question struck a nerve. I spend 60+ hours a week doing everything with the toddler, making sure he is fed, bathed, reading him books, library trips, shopping, showering with a toddler because he likes to jump in with me sometimes, and even having a constant bathroom buddy who wants to demand milk while I am pooping, but clearly I hate him because I want a chance to have a break and visit grandmother in law at the hospital without worrying about a three year old. /s\n\nI love my husband, I do, but sometimes I just want to grab that man by the lapels and shake him a little.",

Sometimes it's a case of: upset whiny 9 month old not wanting to play on her mat whilst I'm making lunch vs 9 month old that lights up and loves watching a bit of Peppa whilst I make lunch. Feel bad this has become a bit of a daily habit, but only ever for a maximum half hour or so a day. Peppa has been a lifesaver on a number of occasions, especially when she had an ear infection and needed distraction from antibiotics!!! \n\nI pretty much interact with her all the time normally, do baby groups etc... but it's hard to not feel a bit guilty!!",

He is on his second night of sleep training, because his pediatrician insisted that we bring our co-sleeping and night-nursing to an end. My son, a sweet, and sensitive 12-month-old, has shared a room, with us for his whole life, and has slept between his mom and dad every night for the last 8 months, but no more. I am certainly going through withdrawals from having him cuddled up next to me, and every time he awakens and cries, I have to suppress and ignore all of my maternal instincts that tell me to go comfort my child. \n\nWe live in a one bedroom, one bathroom apartment in a dense urban neighborhood. So during sleep training, my husband and I are sleeping on a pull-out futon in the living room next to the bedroom. An added bonus- To get to the bathroom,I have to travel past his crib. About an hour ago I made this mission to the bathroom and regrettably, I knocked the toy airplane into the bathtub, which abruptly woke up my son, and he proceeded to scream for a few minutes while I listened helplessly, hiding in the bathroom. I knew if he saw me, he'd cry louder and harder and would have a harder time falling asleep. So I stayed sitting in the dark bathroom while my son rolled around in his crib, tossing and turning and bumping around, trying desperately to get back to sleep. I felt awful, because I knew I was the cause of his discomfort and stress. \n\nI have tried and failed at sleep training before. The first time the pediatrician told us we needed to sleep train, I cracked under the pressure and went to my baby's rescue when he wouldn't stop crying, and we abandoned ship from there. Now the doctor insists we try again, blaming his lack of weight gain on night-nursing. So here we are, 3am and I am just missing my child, who is 10 long feet away, instead of right near my heart. \n\nNow that he has officially fallen back asleep, I can say that sharing this painful aside has at least given me perspective, that in the end, this really isn't that bad, and we'll get through it. I just pray he doesn't learn to climb out of the crib tonight. ",

            "selftext": "My first pregnancy was hard because we ended up losing the baby due to a miscarriage and lived with my in laws at the time. I was gifted a couple things for the baby that I had left in my room on the night stand. When I had come home from the hospital after the miscarriage I saw my baby stuff were gone. My mother in law took them without asking me. I\u2019m sure she did it trying to not upset me but I feel like she had no right to. It took us a little over a year to get pregnant again and this time around we lived with my parents to help them out. At the time I worked for a hotel that my mother in law was a manager for and my father in law and husband were also employed there too. I had to tell my mother in law the days and times of my appointments so that she wouldn\u2019t schedule me for those times and she would invite herself to my appointments!!!! Our first baby and there she was every single time. I told my husband that it was our first baby and I didn\u2019t want her at our appointments I just wanted those special moments with just me and him. He told me she was just excited but he would still talk to her. (This is her 6th grandchild )Anyway we thought it would be fun to have one of those gender reveals so we could all find out with the family and celebrate. The plan was for my sister and mom to throw the gender reveal and his sister and mom to throw the baby shower. The day of finding out what we were having at the dr was getting closer and I asked my husband if he talked to his mom about showing up at our appointments and he said he did. She knew what day we were going to find out the gender and as soon as I walk into the waiting room to my appointment I don\u2019t only see my mother in law but my father in law too. I was so mad I wanted to cry but still said nothing. They wanted to find out so fine. Whatever. One day at work I was talking to a co worker she was telling me she thinks I\u2019m having a girl and my mother in law walks past us and says with attitude \u201cI\u2019m 110% sure it\u2019s a boy \u201c rolls her eyes and walks off. My co worker was at a loss for words. Everybody knew I was having a gender reveal to find out what I was having (including my mother in law) when I got off work I cried to my husband telling him his mom already told me what we were having and all the work and money my sister was putting in for the get together was all for nothing now. He told me she probably just said that to throw us off and we still weren\u2019t sure what we were having and he was going to talk to her. I\u2019m sure he never did. And at the gender reveal found out in fact it was a boy. Fast forward at 7 months pregnant and I\u2019m sitting in the office on my lunch and my mother in law is telling me she bought a car seat for the baby and that she bought a stroller for the baby and that she\u2019s looking into a bassinet (all things that we already have at our home and that she knows we have ) confused I don\u2019t say anything until I get home. Told my husband idk what she\u2019s thinking but she\u2019s not keeping the baby??? I think she had in her mind that she was going to just come over and get them whenever she wanted and then bring them back. Not ok. So he tells her and she starts crying saying that\u2019s just not how she thought things would be. Like....I don\u2019t see why she would think that would be okay.  Then at work my mother in law was telling me who was going to be in MY delivery room. She said my father in law had to be in there and he was going to cut the baby\u2019s cord because it was tradition (um no it\u2019s not because he didn\u2019t do it to all grandkids so no). I was livid at this point. I couldn\u2019t believe she was telling me who was going to be in my delivery room. I told my husband that I was not comfortable having his dad in there and that it was not ok for her to be telling me who I\u2019m having. He was upset that I didn\u2019t want his dad in there but still told them anyway. The day he told them and I had to work I got into the office and got sent to doing housekeeping. At 8 months pregnant I had 12 rooms to clean. She partnered me up with my coworker who was 5months pregnant. I got up stairs and saw my father in law and said hi and good morning and he looked right through me and walked away. (He ended up ignoring me for about 3weeks and didn\u2019t talk to me until my husband asked ME to say something to him first ) my father in law came to see how many rooms we had left to do a couple hours later and I got a call from my mother in law getting yelled at for not having as many rooms done as everyone else. Again I\u2019m 8months pregnant at this point. After finishing the rooms I go downstairs and work my usual front desk shift and check in guests and she gives me two trash bags full of a bunch of towels and sheets that she told me to spray with this thick smelly chemical. I told her I couldn\u2019t do it because my dr said I shouldn\u2019t use chemicals and I had already cleaned rooms that day and she told me she was going to write me up for not doing my job. So i did it. I wanted to call Human Resources on her but didn\u2019t because she was family. At that point I was too scared to tell her I didn\u2019t want her in my delivery room because I knew she was going to take it out on me at work giving me night shifts cutting my hours and having me work in housekeeping. The last straw was when my husband and I agreed to not circumcise the baby. I knew that my mother in law was going to say something because surprise surprise she told me I had to get him circumcised. I told him \u201cwhat are you going to tell your mom when she asks u why were not doing it \u201c and he told me he was going to tell her it was none of her business. After I had the baby I saw text msgs from his mom and she had sent him a screenshot of a pros list to circumcising babies. And his response was \u201cI know mom but she doesn\u2019t want to\u201d. I was so pissed. I felt like this was the last straw. He let his parents treat me like shit and I was over it. I wasn\u2019t going to have them disrespect me anymore. Especially in front of my son. Now they only see him here and there when I feel bad that my husbands family can\u2019t enjoy him as much as he would like. So recently I saw his mom shaking the baby (playing with him) still dangerous and not ok so I said something about it and she took it the wrong way. Then we went to visit an aunt at the hospital on Christmas Eve after she had surgery and they had told us to go and we ended up waiting for 2 hours to see her and I told him we had to go get ready because we had plans and  very rudely his mother said \u201cit\u2019s fine just leave I\u2019ll just tell her you stopped by\u201d. I didn\u2019t see what the big deal was we could visit her when she got home and we had already been waiting for a long time and had plans. After that I told my husband I didn\u2019t want anything to do with his mother. I no longer work there either. I\u2019m just so tiered for her acting like the victim and like she hasn\u2019t done anything wrong but when I see her she\u2019s incredibly rude and irritating. Am I crazy?? Should I get over it??",

At about that point, I started cooking for myself and my wife only, things that we like to eat and cook. \n\nEventually, one kid said, \"That smells really good, can I have some?\" I said that I only made enough for the two of us, but if they'd like some of tomorrow's dinner, let me know and I can make extra. I was expecting \"what's tomorrow's dinner\" but instead I got, \"yes, please, anything's better than more sandwiches.\"\n\nAll of them eventually followed suit. I'm back to cooking for six, but I'm making whatever I want to make. If anyone has a problem with it, there's sandwiches or cereal. And surprisingly, sandwiches and cereal are being chosen very rarely.\n\nSo the retirement didn't last long, but the temporary strike seems to have solved the problem that led to my premature retirement, so I'm good with it.

We were left alone with our 5-year-olds. As we were walking, they grabbed things from the shelves and proceeded to pretend to read them, which is okay, nothing wrong with that. \n\nNext thing I know they are grabbing every single cereal box off of the shelf and dumping it on the floor. One of them hits the other on the head with a box, so she starts crying and people start turning around to see what's happening. My wife tries to calm her down and I yell at the other. \n\nAfter that, when we were paying, the daughter that hit her sister on the head grabs the bag and because it's heavy, she drops it and a jar breaks. We had to pay. In the car, I was yelling at my daughter for doing that while my wife was yelling at me. Our 12-year-old daughter was likely not aware of the yelling because she had her headphones on. \n\nMy wife said that she's a kid who needs to be taught behavior in public places in a calm way and that all kids do that, (I saw plenty of younger kids in the store and none did that) but how could I be calm if she repeatedly hit her sister on the head with a box? \n\nI seriously need advice. \n\n\n",

He said I should just leave him at my place while I went to the post office.  I told him he was to little to do that and he responded that his mother lets him stay home alone.  I asked when and he said when she walks the dogs.  I was shocked and horrified.  I asked if it was just once and he said it was all the time when they went on long walks.  I asked what he did and he said he sat and watched tv.  I asked several times to make sure and he confirmed saying sometimes he went and sometimes he just stayed home while she walked them.  His initial reaction that he was old enough to stay home while I left and did other things freaked me out.  I believe 4 years old is much too young to be left unattended.  Am I wrong?  I asked him if there was a fire and no one was there what should he do.  He said he didn\u2019t know.  I asked what if a stranger came in and he said he didn\u2019t know. :/",

            "selftext": "Sorry for my English, its not my first language. It was never my best subject and I have not had many opportunitys for practice since having my baby. \n\nMy baby was born in early September. She is three months. I am 26. My Fiance is 25. The pregnancy was unplanned. We were using condoms (because the Contracaption Hormonal makes me very depressed and I become overweight when I use it). But I guess we had a break because I becomed pregnant. I was not happy because I did not want children before 30 bu made the best of it. My fiance wished for me to have abortion but also did not push hard. He says now he felt pressured to \"support\" even though his wish was not to be father yet. But we also live in country where abortion is crime except for very few circumstances, so my options would have been to file a false rape report with the police or a illegal abortion which I was afraid to do. I did want but was afraid. But now my daughter was born, I feel bad I feel that way. Of course I never tell anyone they will change mind when baby is born. Everyone is individual. My circumstance is mine. \n\nBefore this we says we wanted children in future. My husband now says he never wants more because now he knows what it is like to be father he does not want it again. He says he does not hate out daughter. He says he loves her. But that being a father is \"shit\" most of the time. He says he misses money, freedom, sleep. He blames our daughter for the fact we will now not travel overseas for honeymoon after wedding. \n\nHe does not help me much with baby. \n\nHe comes homes from work and goes straight to play Dota or watch football. He want to spend weekends playing Dota or watching football or on his phone. When I tell him I need helps with with the baby, he tells me \"you choose this\". I said \"excuse me\". He said \"you could have had abortion\". I remind him of the law. He says I am \"making excuses\" because I could have had the secret abortion like a couple of friends have (it would have used a lot of our savings but we could have affords) or filed the police report like his sister did (two years ago she made a false rape report to get abortion. I know people feel strong against false rape reports, I understand why. But they are often the only way if you are not from a family with money. She was student and my parents in law very catholic. They would not have given money for it.) \n\nI want to go out and see friends, he tells me he will not have the baby all day. Again he say \"you chose this rather than the abortion, it more your problem to mine\". \n\nHe does not hate our daughter but gets resentful (?) the moment she disrupt him or has need. He is OK if baby want to sleep on his chest and he can watch football. He like to take pictures of her when she be quiet and peaceful. But she commence to cry or need the diaper change, he becomes very annoyed. If she commence to cry through the night he say \"I work, you wanted this\" and return to sleep. He only loves her when it is enjoyable or suitable, when she is difficult, he says she ruined his life.\n\nI don't know what to do because I am overwhelmed and tired very often and do not have much of the help. \n\nAny advice?

He couldn\u2019t bother to carry the suitcases upstairs that have been sitting in the middle of our living room for 3 days, but then has the audacity to ask if I\u2019m going to get anything done today.\n\nYou\u2019re daughter is fed, clean, doing well, and you have dinner as well as clean clothes and dishes. I don\u2019t know when I\u2019d have time to do anything else.\n\nI\u2019m throwing in the towel and giving up. I just can\u2019t anymore.",

            "selftext": "My two kids are generally of good behavior, but, like any kid, they don't listen often. \n\nI feel like I try to control their every move - they'll get into little spats because the 3 year old wants her way but the 7 year old won't share so they'll start going back and forth, and that's when I'll step in and start yelling.\n\nSometimes, I lose my shit and scream. If we're in the car (or at home) and someone spills their drink or their food - it's 50/50 with me. Either I'll be okay and say \"that's ok, get a paper towel and clean it up, please\" or I'll flip shit and be like \"WHAT THE FUCK WHY DID THIS HAPPEN, WHY ARE YOU NOT MORE CAREFUL!! CLEAN IT UP **RIGHT NOW**\" and just scream all of that...\n\nWhen they lose it emotionally and cry and throw fits about stuff - I'm also 50/50. Sometimes I'll be comforting and try to talk through things, but more often than not I'll yell right back and get real nasty-toned and say \"stop it\" several times. Sometimes I'll even grab an arm with a tight grip and get in their ears with my nasty tone and tell them to stop it or else I'm gonna drag them upstairs to their rooms (which, anytime I've brought them upstairs and sent them to their rooms I've carried them - against their will). \n\nI don't know why but I can't for the life of me step back, take a breath, and remember they're kids. I find myself yelling at my oldest more than my youngest. I don't want to keep doing this - it's not fair to hold them to an adult standard - but I cannot stop myself. When I yell at home and my husband is around he'll usually tell me to stop - he can get real defensive about it.\n\nI'm here for your help. If there's people here who have screamed and yelled and overcome this, please help me. I'm ruining my children. I was in the grocery store this morning and overheard a mom getting snippy with her 7 or 8 year old and I felt embarrassed for the little girl and for myself - because I get the same way if she doesn't listen and perform to my commands/demands.\n\nBackground context if anyone needs it: we spank only in *extreme* circumstances (I'd say maybe three or four times a year). I have tried using time out in the past but situations, to me, don't really ever warrant time outs. My husband and I both work full time jobs - his schedule is more variable bc he's in the restaurant industry, but I have a 8-5 office job and I go to school at night 3 times a week. I'm off on weekends, he usually works one or both weekend days. His mother lives with us and helps take care of them when we're not home (she, from what I have seen, doesn't yell and scream, but she can be tough if need be). We live in a culdesac full of kids of similar age - and they all have no problem obeying their parents the first time their parents ask them to do or not do something.\n\n**tl;dr** I scream at my kids all the time because I hold them to an adult standard and I'd really like to stop doing that.",

I try to make sure that my parents see the baby once a week. \n\nMy parents feel alienated. I don't feel comfortable with my parents watching the baby in their home because they have 2 dogs that I don't trust and a blase attitude towards safety. I also don't trust they would follow any rules I set for them. \n\nI work alot. I don't expect my wife and mother to hang out without me and I don't want to spend my off time with any extended family. I like to spend the time watching football and playing with my baby on the couch.\n\nSo, I asked my MIL and wife to stop posting on Facebook. They were outraged. \n\nMy mother has begun acting neurotically. She buys unwanted gifts for the baby and demands the baby wears it for special occasions or plays with it. This is out of character. \n\nI have approached all involved parties about compromising and they are all terrible people. \n\nI am just going to ignore everyone and hide in my basement with a cooler of beer.\n\nI am not sure this is succinct, thanks for reading anyway \n\nThanks,\n\nCollin Syphard \n\n",

            "selftext": "Background: mother of two boys ages 11 and 7. Husband and I have been together for 13 years. 11 year old has been diagnosed with various behavior/mental illnesses: ADD/ADHD, ODD, depression, anxiety.\n\nIn September he was admitted to a psychiatric inpatient treatment program at a children's hospital for a week. Of course he was the model patient so no one there experienced what he is really like. \n\nI honestly don't know what is wrong with this child. But we have known something was wrong ever since he was about 2 or 3. At age 4 he locked my parents out of their home because he was mad at them. \n\nBetween 6-11 years old he has; destroyed his bedroom, beat his brother, thrown patio furniture in the pool, destroyed my recently planted vegetable garden, threatened to throw a bar stool through our sliding glass door, held a knife to his throat, threatens suicide (why he was in inpatient), attempted to jump from my car while it was moving.\n\nIt just gets worse and worse with this kid...\n\nHe calls his father \"Gramps\" or \"old man\" to push his buttons. He calls me an \"old hag\" or \"get out of my face woman!!!\" Or he will tell me \"hey maid, when is dinner ready? And it better be made from scratch this time, not from a can!\"....he calls me fat, ugly, and if I break down and cry he will make fun of me for it \"awww is the little girl gonna cwy like a witty bitty baby?\". My son says this to me.\n\nThen the next day he is sorry....\n\nHe recently brought home all F's on his report card (1 C-). We had zero clue he was doing so poorly in school. Before Halloween I had a conference with his teacher and she had nothing negative to say about my kid. All of a sudden he brings home F's. This week he was given an extension on an assignment he was given at the beginning of November. Its a packet of brain teasers, about 16 pages front and back. In a month he did 2 pages. So over the weekend we have been trying to get him to complete it. He doesn't care. He refuses to do it.\n\nAs a result of the poor grades his internet was taken away. He was using my husband's old phone (he doesn't have his own, no way can that kid have a phone), via WiFi. I decided to take a peek at his browsing history. He was visiting websites that generate fake credit card numbers. Googling \"what does cvc mean?\" and \"what does mm/yy mean?\". So we no longer trust him online. \n\nLast night we had it with his behavior/mouth and took away his Xbox. For good. Gone. No more.\n\nToday I get an email from Xbox Live saying someone filed a complaint against my son for his atrocious online behavior and he has been banned!!! I didn't even know that was a thing.....\n\nHe has a psychiatrist. My kid refuses to take his meds. He has a therapist. She has not helped. \n\nIn total he has seen; 3 different psychiatrists, 2 different therapists, and a psychologist.\n\nOur insurance sucks by the way.\n\nI feel like I should take a leave of absence from work and just take this kid to therapy weekly. \n\nI'm out of ideas....I don't know what to do other than switch doctors, again. I have read books. I've taken a class. I'm enrolled in a class for spring 2019 on behavior management for ADHD kids. If we could afford boarding school we would do it in a heartbeat. But we can't afford it.\n\nAny ideas at all? Advice? Anything? \n",

I feed them, change them, cuddle them, make sure they're warm and clean, that they aren't hurting, that they don't have gas, I give them tummy time, I read and sing to them, I play with them (as much as you can with an infant) and they just don't stop. I'm losing my mind. I feel like I'm going to go insane. Everyone tells me I'm amazing for having two and that I was made to be a mom but oh my God I feel like that couldn't be further from the truth. \n\nI hate them sometimes. Like, I just can't stand them. And I feel like the worst person in the world for feeling that but they're just relentless. It's like they conspire against me, making plans that when L1 stops crying L2 starts. They cry until they burst blood vessels in their eyes. Screaming like they're being murdered. AND NOTHING STOPS THEM EXCEPT ME HOLDING THEM. They aren't sick, they don't have colic, nothing is visibly wrong. I can't hold two babies at the same time all the time!! Why don't they understand that??? I'm so tired I can't think of basic words. I don't want to do this. I would never leave, I would never hurt them, but I'm at the end of my rope.\n\nPlease tell me it gets better. I need help. I sob every day about how terrible I feel about all of this, and mostly because my babies are crying and I can't fix it and it makes me so angry.",

            "selftext": "I\u2019m a 35m married for 8 years we have 2 kids, a 1yo and a 4yo. Wife has an awesome job in finance making over 250k a year that is the reason why I can stay home to raise our kids. As a kid I was in gifted and talented programs but was also abused by my parents and treated shitty by a lot of peers. I have an engineering degree and have been more than \u201chandy\u201d my whole life. It\u2019s really important to me that my kids get a \u201creal\u201d childhood and take being a dad serious because mine sucked so bad. That\u2019s a quick backstory.\n\nA handful of my friends and family are equally or more successful and they treat me like a junior member of society or something. To them, I am a fool for not putting my kids in day care because I can make more money than it would cost. They think this means I\u2019m lazy and don\u2019t want to work. I get the impression that they see society as a pecking order and the highest earners are on top with everyone else filling in below them. To them I\u2019m not even on the map. Add in some mainly man attitude and people like to joke around like I\u2019m gay or feminine. I am 6\u20193, work out and used to do jiujitsu, I could unscrew their heads if I want to. Since I\u2019m home I can shuffle my time to accomplish many things big and small along w taking care of the kids and extras. I remodel my house, take care of all car maintenance, cut my own lawn etc. We have a great income and very little of it leaves in terms of expenses since I handle everything so wifey is free to do her thing in office land.\n\nRecently at a famil get together I over heard a uncle in law saying that his truck had no brakes on the way there. They both work in medicine have a mc mansion w a his and hers Benz and Porsche but this is their shit truck they use on the weekends. I offered to help them and take a look at the truck during my week. They are acting like they are doing me a favor because I must be bored during the week with the kids because I am not at work. I have to not do something in order to make time to help them out.\n\nThe week before I was talking about finishing a home project to friends at s thanksgiving thing. I mentioned how I just had the painting left after I had finished all the trim. My buddy in front of everybody made s thing about how painting is a waste of time and to just pay someone to do it. I felt like I had to be defensive to justify NOT paying someone to do simple work. He made a \u201cbelow his pay grade\u201d type comment.\n\nThis type of thing happens weekly and it makes me very frustrated with people who are close to me. I try to talk to my wife about it doesn\u2019t help, we sort of argued about it. I brought up the truck thing and she said so don\u2019t fix it. When she got out of the shower this morning I said I had been up for a couple hours. She patted me on the shoulder like a kid and said she had to get up MORE with the baby. Like even though I was tired, it wasn\u2019t REAL tired.\n\nHow the hell do I put up with everyone acting like I\u2019m taking it easy and talking down to me when I\u2019m exhausted and stressed out all the time?",

Spaghetti? I make my sauce with Italian sausage and one kid has decided she hates fennel. One kid has Celiac, which rules out wheat (obviously not her fault) so that makes it harder. One kid hates cheese, which rules out a lot of things. One kid hates chicken. We were safe for a while with tacos until one kid decided she was never eating tacos again.\n\nSo tonight, I was stand in the grocery store feeling stupid. Like there's an entire store full of food, and I'm able to buy anything in the store within reason, and yet somebody will complain about anything I make.\n\nAnd that's why, in the middle of that grocery store, I decided to retire from cooking for the family.\n\nI came home with assorted ingredients instead and told the kids we will still provide food but it will now be their responsibility to prepare it for themselves and feed themselves with it.\n\nI was expecting a lot of protest, but nobody said much. After about 30 minutes, they decided I really wasn't cooking dinner and they actually started feeding themselves. One kid made a turkey and cheese sandwich, one made peanut butter and jelly. The one with Celiac decided to make herself and her sister some noodle soup with rice noodles, chicken stock, and veggies.\n\nIf it looks like we're going to encounter nutritional deficiencies, I guess we'll address that as it comes up, but so far I'm pleased with the results of Night One.\n\nWill post future updates if anyone's interested.

Currently, our daughter (who is almost 3) goes to a dayhome. Increasingly I am finding it difficult to manage the drop offs, pick ups, cooking, cleaning, appointments, etc when I'm solo. I would like to hire a nanny, but my husband is not in agreement at all. He thinks I should be able to manage everything with no problem and is upset when he comes home and the house is not in order. I have so little time during the week to get much accomplished and I would rather spend my free time hanging out with our daughter instead of cooking and cleaning. If I did hire a nanny, he has made it clear that I would be paying her from my own salary and not from our joint account. I just feel like his expectations of me are unrealistic. ",

            "selftext": "I'm sorry to come here with a downer post. But I really, really need help and I don't have anyone I can speak to about how bad the situation is. \n\nMy son is 7. He is diagnosed with ADHD and we are waiting to get in to the psych to get him on meds (Earliest appt is February). \n\nI am absolutely at the end of my rope. With life, with parenting, with everything. Every day I just want to run away. I don't want to try anymore and most of the time I don't. I think about my mom with 4 kids and am filled with shame--she was thin, happy, involved, a great housekeeper, and overall just a super mom. I love her and she is a lovely lady. I am nothing like her and I am failing my children and I don't know what to do. I am desperate for help. \n\nMy son is a very difficult child. He has been since he was born, but instead of getting better, it's just....it's stayed horrible but just in different ways as he grows and changes. When he was 2, he could throw temper tantrums that lasted HOURS. Normal parenting advice about things like potty training and transitioning to big beds just simply did not apply to him. \n\nNow that he is 7, I have absolutely no skills left to deal with the unending barrage of chaos that I have to cope with. Instead of 3 hour temper tantrums, I get constant, unending, unyielding defiance about EVERYTHING. I don't think normal people understand what I mean and this is why I am so alone and so sad and so desperate for help. When I say everything, I am not exaggerating. I mean literally every request or directive that comes out of my mouth is responded with \"no\", an excuse, a negotiation, or just not responded to or complied with. It didn't used to be this bad but we are on a really tough streak for the past month. \n\nAside from an absolute refusal to just say \"okay\" and complete simple tasks that benefit his well-being (such as getting himself a plate for dinner or putting his shoes on for school), he has literally no ability to regulate his impulses, plan his behavior, or follow instructions. It's getting to the point now where I honestly wonder if he just does this shit to me on purpose. \n\nI will give you an example of my day today:\n\n\"Mommy can I have iPad time?\"\n\n\"I don't mind if you watch a movie today but I am cooking Thanksgiving dinner right now. Your dad is going to have to help you get set up with that.\"\n\n\"Can I use your computer to watch a movie?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry buddy but my computer has all my recipes on it. Go to your dad in the den and he can get you sorted out.\"\n\nI turn around 30 seconds later and he has shut down all my tabs and is on Netflix. \n\nI subsequently lose my shit. I JUST EXPLAINED the situation calmly and he just doesn't fucking care. \"I said to go to your dad! He can help you find the ipad I don't know where it is! You can't use my computer!\" (I am literally in the middle of cooking 5 things at once.)\n\nSo what does he do? He walked into his sister's room where she was sleeping, loudly asks her where she put the ipad, climbs on her bed to try and find it, and woke her up. So now she's crying. \n\nI LITERALLY TOLD HIM 5 TIMES TO TAKE 2 STEPS AND ASK HIS DAD. Like honestly what the fuck. This is how our life is, constantly. It does not end. Asking him to put his shoes on in the morning can result in fits and fighting. He will wander around not following instructions, argue, talk back, and when he's not doing that he's just an obnoxious pest. He doesn't care about how his behavior affects anyone. He doesn't care if he makes his sister cry. He is always the victim. Nothing is ever fair. \n\nHe is 7 and throws temper tantrums more ridiculous than his 4 year old sister. Everything is whining and crying. I am so fucking sick of it. Like EVERYTHING you guys. I can't have a normal family because this child derails any benign, normal, typical, asinine interaction involved in the functioning of a family. \n\nI hate my life. I don't like my child. I don't like being a parent. I cannot meet his needs and sometimes I get so filled with rage I worry I will lose control and just completely wail on him. I have been physical with him in the past over this kind of behavior and I feel horrible. I am a horrible, horrible, horrible woman and mom. I never thought I would be like this. Instead of being a loving mother I'm angry, yelling, punishing my son. I've spanked him. I've pushed and pulled him. He is nasty and miserable to all the members of our family and many children at school. \n\nI don't know how it ended up like this. I made all his baby food organic, taught him baby sign language, didn't expose him to screens until he was 2, he attended a lovely Montessori school, went camping with us, got lots of love, hugs, kisses, and cuddles. But starting around age 2 he has turned my life into a living hell and I don't know what to do anymore.",

            "selftext": "Me and my wife are coming up on the end of our rope with our daughter (8 years old) and just completely unsure what to do. Wanted to see if anyone has experienced something like this. It seems to me like our daughter is a sociopath but maybe I\u2019m just looking for an excuse, I honestly don\u2019t know. \n\nOur daughter has always misbehaved but it\u2019s a number of things about the way that she misbehaves that has us very worried. I will list a few examples:\n\n1) She steals: this has become one of the biggest issues and one that I can\u2019t seem to make any progress on. She will take anything from anyone in the house if she wants it. She often steals snacks from my nightstand or her mother\u2019s makeup among many other things. \n\nI have tried combating this a number of ways. On at least 10 occasions I\u2019ve sat her down and had some variation of a heart to heart talk. Things along the lines of \u201cIt really hurts our feelings when we go work really hard and then buy a little treat and you just take it when we were really looking forward to it\u201d or \u201cIt\u2019s not your stuff, imagine how you\u2019d feel if someone came into your room and took teddy away\u201d. Pretty much all variants of that type of talk. \n\nWe don\u2019t hit our kids and I\u2019m very firm on that but we have yelled at her, sent her to her room and I once even tried to show her how it felt by having her do a chore, paying her, taking her to go get candy, and then stealing it before she could eat it (followed of course by another heart to heart.)\n\nWhat bothers me here is none of this has curved the behavior whatsoever. I once had one of these talks with her, she apologized a lot and said she didn\u2019t want to hurt her family\u2019s feelings anymore and as soon as I stepped outside for a cigarette I looked in the window and she was stealing Cheetos out of a bag her mom left by the computer. \n\n2) She won\u2019t do literally anything she is asked: the biggest way in which this is visible iscwith cleaning her room but also applies to homework and other things. If a big weekend is coming up and my parents are visiting from out of town or something similar me and my wife will ask her to clean her room. Usually a few times nicely, then more sternly until she\u2019s eventually confined to her room until it\u2019s cleaned. This will basically never happen within days. I\u2019ll check in for the first couple hours and give her a \u201cHows everything coming, doesn\u2019t look like a lot has been done yet, remember Grandmas coming let\u2019s get started on it\u201d and will devolve over the course of the day into \u201cYou would\u2019ve been done already if you just did the work, don\u2019t you want to come out and play with your brother and have dinner with the family?\u201d \n\nDuring this time she will come out of her room to show us art projects she made or to randomly ask questions or just to say things like \u201cRemember that time Jimmy fell over in the snow mom?\u201d\nAs is the trend these start by being met with \u201cOh yeah, that was very funny but remember we are working on our rooms right now\u201d but gradually grinds into \u201cYou are to be in your room right now, until it\u2019s clean there will be no more of this\u201d \n\nBut it doesn\u2019t get done. Sometimes if there are no major dates coming up it can go weeks. After school she goes directly to her room, sneaks out a few times to try and watch her brothers TV or steal some snacks and inevitably gets sent back and does 0 work. \nShe has even scammed her grandmother or uncles on a few occasions. The day of the event comes, she still hasn\u2019t cleaned it by the time they\u2019ve come over so she gets emotional and they enable her with the old \u201coh she just needs some help\u201d and then they clean it for her. I\u2019ve given her all the talks about family responsibility and doing your part and on one occasion even threw away all of her toys she refused to clean. No change in behavior. \n\nFor her homework it\u2019s the same. She will sit at the table for 6 hours doing nothing unless I sit there and make her do it problem by problem. If there are 10 problems solved exactly the same way and I work with her to learn how to do it,  then let her solve one herself and say \u201cokay finish off that section I\u2019ve got to put some laundry in\u201d she will never have made any progress when I return. She will say it\u2019s too hard or she doesn\u2019t understand even if she just did this exact problem with 2 different numbers. \n\nThis is probably the most damaging trait to the family because it just ruins everyone\u2019s day. You have a free Sunday and you want to get some relaxation in? By the end of the day you\u2019ve spent half your time trying to convince her to do her stuff or arguing with her and its Just constantly exhausting. Get off work and make dinner, got an hour or two before you\u2019ve gotta get ready for bed? You\u2019ll be spending that on homework. I\u2019ve sat with her for 5 hours on a few pages of homework, literally. \n\n3) Fake Affect: I had suspicions about this for many years but it\u2019s become really obvious lately. When I was really young I used to lie a lot and as I got older I realized how foolish I must\u2019ve looked since I was rarely called out so I\u2019ve made it a point with my kids to call it out right away when I see it to not let it ever get in their heads that the lies are working. \n\nIf she lies to me I\u2019ll say right away \u201cI know you are lying, here\u2019s why, don\u2019t lie\u201d. This has never stopped her lying of course but recently I\u2019ve had to do it with her emotions. I used to give her the benefit of the doubt but the first time I said \u201cStop this, you are pretending\u201d her face cleared up from tears instantly into an almost annoyed face. I can\u2019t even describe it, it was instant. Before being called out she can be wailing and saying \u201cI love my family I\u2019m so sorry I\u2019ll clean my room! I love my family!\u201d But if you call her out she stops instantly and says things like \u201cwell my brother put that stuff in my room, he should have to clean it\u201d \n\nThose are the major issues I guess but I\u2019ll give some other random info in bulletpoints that might be relevant: \n\n-Me and her mother are both college educated and generally speak kindve as I\u2019ve written this, pseudo-intellectually I\u2019d say. Her older brother is a straight A student who socializes well and is extremely helpful around the house. At 12 he even took a job helping a couple a few neighborhoods away with their pool so that he could buy his own dinners and such If he wanted to. She is a very poor student. Her reading is very basic and she can write but she\u2019d likely spell ya least half of her words wrong. I don\u2019t think this is necessarily due to a lack on intelligence so much as a lack of caring. She can show real wisdom about things sometimes but she doesn\u2019t want to be at school so she pays basically 0 attention and no teachers have found a way to get her to focus or listen. \n\n- We took her to a psychiatrist but I really felt scammed by our experience there. He didn\u2019t spend almost any time with us or her, they \u201cran a few tests\u201d and he said it was probably just anxiety (we were there mostly to try and see why she didn\u2019t seem to be learning). He probably spent 30 minutes total talking to us or her. \n\n- Not sure how it would be relevant but she definitely has a problem with food. She\u2019s not huge, but she\u2019s gained a lot of weight in the last year. My wife and son are pretty skinny and I have a bit of a dad bod but she\u2019s the only one in the family gaining weight like that. We had to stop buying the snacks me and my wife like because she just steals them and will eat an entire box of snack cakes in an hour, leaving all the wrappers just lying on our floors \n\n\nWould appreciate any thoughts and I will answer any questions I can.

            "selftext": "I was noodling about on Reddit and read an article about Anthony Bourdain making purposefully gross food and putting it into McDonalds packaging to get his daughter to dislike McDonalds. \n\nA commenter then said something along the lines that if you lie to your children, you're a shit parent and your kids will figure out you were a shit parent who lied instead of teaching them real things (paraphrased). OP commented something along the lines of \"Yup. Religion in a nutshell.\" (Daaaamn)\n\nBut before that sentiment got derailed... I was kinda like... wait... what?\n\nSee, i told eldest at 3 that if he was quiet and observant, he might see a dinosaur or wild pokemon (things he was into) in the forests of Ontario. That was a Montreal-Edmonton bus ride and he survived! Mostly because he spent hours just intently watching out the windows. He saw bear. Moose. Deer. Some were even alive!\n\nI told a lot of lies like that. All the time. \n\nBut I've also met parents who won't even do Santa or the Easter Bunny because its \"lies\". \n\nAnd what about that savage religion comment? What about things YOU believe, that others believe are lies? Is the lady who adopts a 9yo who just lost his parents that they are burning in eternal torment because they never married or went to church being a \"good parent by telling the truth\" simply because *she believes it*? \n\nWhat about the shit we tell kids that's just wrong? When I was a kid Pluto was a planet. My older kids started school thinking that there were 9 planets in our solar system, because that's what I had been taught. \n\nIt's a sticky wicket, isnt it? I liked my lies. I thought they were lovely. I never told ugly lies, even when they were self-serving and prevented me from going stir crazy and throttling a 3yo on a 3 day cross country bus trip. \n\nThey always grow out of the lies. It always gets to the point where they just squint at you and say, \"You think you're so smart, Mom. I know what you're trying to do.\" Sigh. But I swear there is TOTALLY a sense of accomplishment and quiet pride in getting the kitchen clean! I SWEAR IM NOT MAKING IT UP. Oh well, I tried. But we still have to clean the kitchen. \n\nMy oldest son is 21 now. He's told me that there was a period of time (basically preschool) where the world was truly a magical place. With fairies and gnomes sneaking about just out of sight behind flowers. Where Mom could talk to squirrels and the \"tch tch tch\" noise that I taught him was squirrel for \"I've got a nice peanut for you\". That trees were deep slow thinkers and watched over us. That they were listening to him when he talked to them.\n\nDiscovering the world is a little more prosaic than that, he didn't mind it because it wasnt like \"LIES!!\" - It was more like it doesn't matter if there are fairies or not or the trees might not even know you're there because you don't really get to interact with them very meaningfully anyway. \n\nI don't really think I damaged them. I don't think it's as black and white as lies=evil.",

            "selftext": "**Background:** My husband (34m) and I (32f) both work 9-5 office jobs in Canada about 30 minutes commute from our son's daycare. Our home is a 5 minute drive from the daycare or a 20 minute walk. My husband does drop-offs and I do pick-ups. In general, he gets to the daycare between 8:30 and 8:45 to arrive at work between 9 and 9:15. His office gives flex time, so if he arrives late, he just stays a bit later at the end of the day and it's no problem for his boss. \n\nI work 8:30am-5:00pm. Leaving at 5 is *always* a challenge. There's always more I have to do because I'm a specialist in my field. No one else can do my job. But I do my best to be there for my son. I end up getting to the daycare between 5:30pm and 5:45pm. On bad days, it might get to 5:55pm but I've never arrived past 6. It breaks my heart to think of my son sitting around as the last kid to leave daycare. But he's a happy kid and the girls who watch over the kids are great. He loves them and they think he's fantastic. Even so, my mom has offered to help on occasion, but frankly, we have a hard enough time getting my son into the carseat (we drive a small car, so it's a challenge fitting him into the seat without bonking his head on the doorframe, or getting a limb caught on something).  I don't want to inconvenience her or cause my son distress if she struggles more than we do to get him in the car.\n\n**Problem**: We started my son at the daycare in September and since the beginning, the woman who runs it, who's passionate about her work and a smart, dedicated educator, has made off-hand remarks to both of us about needing to pick up my son earlier. We did our best to reassure her, but the reality is we're both working parents. I don't know how to have him be at the daycare for less than 9 hours. One day last week, I couldn't get to the daycare until 6 and I received a call the next day from the owner. She yelled at me for about 15 minutes, lecturing me about how hard it is on a toddler to be left at daycare for 10 hours a day. She also chewed me out because my son sometimes struggles with putting boots and snowpants on. For a week or so, he would roll around on the ground and cry when we forced him to wear boots or snowpants. The owner told me she was \"concerned for the safety of her staff\" which struck me as both absurd and a veiled threat. It was like: \"are you threatening to kick my son out of daycare for not wanting to wear snowpants? I didn't say that, but I thought it. Instead I apologized and cried for an hour after getting off the phone with her. It's bad enough feeling guilty as is without getting the talking to. My husband saw her the next day and said what you'd expect: \"there's nothing more we can do, we can't quit our jobs, we both have to work, we're doing the best we can.\" and the owner shrugged it off.\n\nI know there are other parents who are forced to leave their kids at daycare or with babysitters for longer hours than us. 9 hours a day (maybe 9.5 once in a while) can't be the worst. But it definitely feels like it. I guess what I'd like to know is how other parents dealt with this and how they got over it. I would really like to hear similar anecdotes about your experience just to know that we're not alone. ",

            "selftext": "My wife and I have been together for 20 years and we have 5 kids. The son who is not mine biologically recently turned 10 years old. My wife and I agreed it was the right time to tell him. We struggled with this decision because we didn\u2019t know where the line was between waiting for an appropriate age and lying to him for our own comfort. \n\nBased on the facts, our son has a good man who is his biological father who is willing to meet him and be in his life and he has 3 more siblings he has a right to know. \n\nOur decision was made based on the maturity of our now 10 year old and the fact that his biological father was a good person, excluding the affair, and father to his other kids. \n\nShortly after our son was born (I\u2019d been told about the affair a few months prior), we had a dna test that would ultimately confirm our fears. \n\nMyself, my wife, her affair partner, and his wife all agreed that he would sign away any parental rights and that our two families would go our separate ways. We wouldn\u2019t sue for child support, we\u2019d just proceed as if I had been the one who got my wife pregnant. \n\nSince then, my wife and I are still married with no plans I know of to separate or divorce and we both are dedicated to our children. \n\nI won\u2019t lie and tell you parenting our son this thread is about has been easy. It\u2019s been painful and it has also brought me just as much joy and pride as our other children have. \n\nHe\u2019s a good kid, he\u2019s got a big heart, he\u2019s very empathetic and I think this is his best quality. Even when he\u2019s talking to his older siblings when they\u2019re upset they\u2019ve been punished, you can see and hear that he really, genuinely cares and wants to understand so he can help in some way.\n\nWhen his friends at school were having a down day, he\u2019ll tell his siblings and his mother and I about what it was and how he could cheer them up next time he sees them. \n\nHe\u2019s not a particularly gifted athlete but he tries his best and he\u2019s well liked by his teammates and the coaches love him. \n\nHe struggles in school sometimes, but he\u2019s got no quit in him. \n\nI admire him and I love him so much and I\u2019m happy to call him my son but there have been many moments over the years that have been painful.\n\nWhen I\u2019m with him or the whole family and someone comments that he has my smile or eyes or something. My mind immediately says, \u201cNo he doesn\u2019t. He can\u2019t.\u201d \n\nMy son has some health related issues inherited from his father and every time we address them, I think of the man my wife cheated with. \n\nSometimes I just feel like a fool for raising him and I feel terrible for it. When I\u2019m putting money into his education, I think I\u2019m an idiot. When I\u2019m spending a day with him or helping him with homework or scheduling dentist appointments or ordering something for his birthday or taking care of him when he\u2019s sick or teaching him something as a parent. \n\nIt\u2019s like something bubbles up inside me and I have to constantly reject it. He\u2019s never done anything to cause me pain. He\u2019s completely innocent in everything. But those feelings are there and I fear they\u2019ll always be with me. \n\nAnd my wife. I love her. She\u2019s a dream of a mother, she\u2019s funny, she\u2019s a great conversationalist, she\u2019s extremely well read and I\u2019m constantly\u2014constantly learning new things from her and I love that. She\u2019s beautiful and I still to this day feel my heart rate pick up a little when she comes near. And I think I\u2019ve forgiven her but the feelings I mentioned earlier make me wonder if I\u2019m lying to myself and to her.\n\nJust like with my son, I often feel like a fool when I\u2019m doing something for my wife or caring for her. A few months ago for her birthday, I was cooking her favorite meal and half way through, in the kitchen I just stopped moving and thought, \u201cYou\u2019re a fool.\u201d\n\nI stood there in that spot thinking that over and over and trying to to reject it so long my oldest daughter saw me and asked if I was okay. I told her I was thinking about something at work and that was that. \n\nI feel like a terrible person for having these feelings. I\u2019ve seen therapists and I\u2019ve practiced mindfulness and I\u2019ve had lots of success with moving on. I think or thought I\u2019d had forgiven everyone involved. \n\nAnd maybe I have and these feelings are just bubbling up in me because of the presence of the biological father in our lives again and our son being very excited about it cuts me. I\u2019ll never tell or show him that, but it does hurt. \n\nI feel exhausted and want to sleep, but when I tried to lay down and sleep, I couldn\u2019t and ended up writing this. ",

My husband refuses to strap the baby into the car seat. He won't budge on this issue. So I am finally divorcing him. I just cannot allow his actions to endanger our son. I know I have made the right decision. I just regret I didn't get to this point sooner.\n\nThe other bad things have included him controlling me - what I eat, what I wear, who I talk to and what I talk about. How I prepare the baby's bottles, how I spend my money - specifically not allowed to spend MY money on baby safety gates for the stairs.\n\nI had chronic Sciatica very badly after the baby was born. It lasted for 6 months until I got a discectomy. Before the operation I was in 9/10 pain levels every day. I could hardly move. I was nearly suicidal with the pain. Do you think he helped me with our newborn? Lol, not at all! He went to live abroad for months at a time. He said I was faking it. Or that I should offer the pain up to Jesus! \n\nI am pretty sure he is a narcissist. I know what he has been doing is emotional abuse. I have tried to leave before but somehow I always get drawn back to him.\n\nBut my son is so much more important to me. Again and again I have tried to stress the importance of safety. I am actually pretty easy going about most things but not his safety. \n\nOne day a glass broke. I immediately went to sweep it up. Our (then) 8 month old son was playing next to the shards. My husband shouted at me \"no, what are you doing, leave the glass there\"! I said \"what\"? He replied \"he has to learn\"! I know I should have packed my bags then and there. I know I have been a bad mother that I haven't called the solicitor/ police/ social worker sooner than now.\n\nThe good news is: he is currently living abroad. I have changed the locks and informed the landlord that we have separated. I am going to see a therapist tomorrow. I have already told her these safety incidences and she has them on record. \n\nI hate myself that I still love this man. But I love our son more. He will always come first. This is painful. He said I was inflicting permanent psychological damage on our son by denying him his father. He said he will get an annulment. That's bullshit right?\n\nSorry this was so long and rambling. ",

            "selftext": "So at my daughters (9 and a half ) school they can do well in class and earn punches in a card that they can redeem for rewards. My daughter got enough punches and redeem it to be able to take a toy to school. They send home a little thing to let us know what date it is allowed. So this morning my daughter showed me her card and said she wanted to bring her giant husky dog. This husky is so big she can barely carry it. It\u2019s like human sized. I told her she had to pick something else because it was too big. She had a meltdown about how another kids parents brought his in for him and how the school allowed it. But I told her that she couldn\u2019t because I said so, not the school. She takes the bus in and today was a day I couldn\u2019t bring her in with a giant toy and plus the teachers would have to help her with it all day and itd just be a big pain. Maybe with prior approval from the teachers and on a day I was able to drive her in it would have been ok but , I told her to pick something else. We had about half an hour until the bus came. In which she argued with me about the giant dog the whole time and I said no and said how much time she has left to pick out something else. So five minutes before the bus leave she\u2019s still hasn\u2019t picked anything else out. Give her the final warning. Then when it\u2019s time to go out to the bus she says I need to give her more time to pick something else. I then explained she had a half hour to pick something else and she chose to argue with me instead of pick something else and we needed to go out to the bus. She said she knew what else she wanted to bring when we were half way up the driveway but I told her it was too late, I gave her plenty of chances and she didn\u2019t listen and the bus was about to pull up. Then my husband, against my wishes, ran into the house and got the smaller toy she wanted and brought it to her. He said I was being cruel and she\u2019d remember this forever and be really upset. But that was kind of my point. She made a choice to not listen to my \u201cno\u201d my reasons why and my request to compromise. I mean she\u2019s not 2. She\u2019s almost 10. I know this is a defiant stage but at what point do we have children take responsibility for the choices they are making? My husband and I then argue for ten minutes but calmed down and he said he understood where I was coming from, he\u2019s just a softy and doesn\u2019t like the kids upset. Which I get. I realize this situation is a little trivial in the whole scheme of life and I don\u2019t know how well it will transfer to \u201cthe real world\u201d in my children brain. But when I say no my kids usually know I mean it. My husband is the push over and they run to him for everything. I don\u2019t really mind being the mean one but I\u2019ve never felt cruel.",

We\u2019ve been looking at part time jobs for her but besides that idk how else she can connect with the outside world. \n\nI really want her to be happy, I love her so much and never want her to feel like shes alone because I\u2019m always here for her, i try my best to console her but it doesn\u2019t seem to be enough.

            "selftext": "So, while we don\u2019t hit our kids, I always thought that physical punishment was maybe ok in some circumstances.\n\nThen I had a personal experience with it.\n\nI recently started taking karate, as an adult.  It\u2019s a fairly traditional form, and the instructors use a lot of physical correction when teaching.  Sometimes that takes the shape of a smack or a slap to the offending limb if there is an arm or leg in the wrong place. \n\nOne day recently we were practicing punching. The instructor walked along the line, making corrections as he counted.  He stopped in front of me. \n\n\u201cNo, reverse punch,\u201d he said with a smile, tapping my arm lightly. \n\nHe counted the next number and I repeated the movement I thought I was being asked to do. \n\n\u201cReverse punch!\u201d He emphasized again, this time with a slightly sharper smack to my right arm. \n\nI looked at the woman on my left whose belt rank was higher than mine, she seemed to be doing the same thing that I was. I hesitated for a second, then did a reverse punch, focusing on getting it right.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said again in a tone of friendly frustration.  He pulled back his hand and slapped my arm again. \n\nLet\u2019s be clear, he wasn\u2019t hitting me very hard at all. But I found myself getting really flummoxed by this experience. \n\n\u201cMichael!\u201d I exclaimed in exasperation, even though I should have been using a karate-specific title of seniority for him, not his first name.  \u201cI literally have no idea what you are asking me to do!\u201d\n\n Instead of looking irritated, he seemed taken aback. It became obvious to me that he had thought his instructions were very clear. He gamely tried again, and upon his further explanation, I finally understood what he was asking for and I did it correctly. \n\nFast forward a week. \n\nI have asked my daughter to put the object she is running around with down on the counter. She doesn\u2019t obey me, instead she moves away from the kitchen towards the playroom.  I ask her again - there is no playfulness here, I am getting frustrated and I\u2019m raising my voice.  I\u2019m about to yell at her a third time when she looks up at me.  And guess what I see on her face? That same puzzled and flummoxed look I had. I pause, recognition dawning. In a kinder voice, I ask a clarifying question. It is then I figure out that she was not disobeying me- she just didn\u2019t understand which counter I meant. \n\nWhere I am going with this is that in a situation that someone in charge is escalating, it\u2019s easy for communication to break down. I am an adult with a lot of agency. I was taking a class with an instructor who is a social equal who is using physical correction very playfully and very lightly.  And it\u2019s consensual.  Even so it took three smacks for me to tell him I had no clue what he was asking of me.  How can we expect kids to do that when they are flummoxed or even worse, scared of us?\n\nAnyway, my point is - for anyone who is going to hit their kids, try it out personally first.  Seriously.  Even if you were spanked as a kid and turned out fine, have a refresher as to what it feels like for someone to use even very light and well intentioned physical correction in teaching you something. You may come away from the experience with the same thought I did, which is that it is amazing how often people are wrong. \n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "selftext": "Title says it all. We nicely tell him and his wife that we don\u2019t want them kissing our two year old daughter on the lips. I don\u2019t feel like I need to justify my reasons for that.\n\nThis goes on a few different times after we mention something. Giving the benefit of the doubt, I decide to verbally tell them \u201ccheek kisses only\u201d as we\u2019re leaving their house. Mother-in-law gets it with no problems. Step-father-in-law heard me say it twice, feet away from him, and does it anyway.\n\nEnraged, I write them a text message stating that my daughter is \u201ccheek kisses only\u201d. Literally no response. They just don\u2019t acknowledge my presence for the next couple months.\n\nSo I\u2019m thinking that rather than call him out for evading me (which I feel I have every right to call out) we\u2019ll make this and a couple other situations the example reason for why we can\u2019t have confidence in them to watch our daughter. After a couple months, sure enough, mother-in-law asks my wife when our daughter is staying over and my wife lays it all out.\n\nWell, expectedly this did not get received well. To the point where her mother wants nothing to do with us. Blocked on Facebook, out of their lives indefinitely along with any relatives that agree with us. We even stated that she personally could come over to our house to watch our daughter but that was not good enough \u2013 all or nothing.\n\nHas anyone had similar situations to this? If so, how did you handle it and did it ever resolve over time?",

            "selftext": "Little one is almost 2.My wife and I have pushed handwashing for months with our LO. LO hates it, cries, freaks out every time. Almost ready to give up. Fast forward to this week. We're potty training and it's absolute hell filled with tears and breakdowns. I borrow a PBS kids potty training DVD from the library featuring two episodes of Daniel Tigers Neighborhood. It's her first time seeing Daniel Tiger and she's enthralled and excited because a kitty ( \"'Itty!' 'Itty!\") is on TV. 'Itty washes his hands after using the toilet. Sure enough after she sits on the potty again she announces \"all done!\" and then \" 'ash! 'ash! 'ash!\" This is a new word. What could it be? It sounds a lot like wash and she was reaching to the sink. I pick her up and start the water... And she washes her hands. No fuss. No complaints. Puts them right in the water and giggles. Why? Not months of encouragement and positive reinforcement, not all the reassurance and praise we give her when she suffers through it. Nope.  Because a fricking animated kitty sang a song and washed his hands. Just like that. A singing cat. Daniel. Fricking. Tiger. I hope they have episodes and songs on how to become a millionaire and well adjusted individual  when she's older because that cat apparently is a damn miracle worker. Send me your ideas and I'll write the studio. I may even be one of the Viewers Like You that makes contributions to their local PBS station that makes Daniel Tiger possible.\n\nEnd vent session. Anyone have similar situations happen to them?",

I promise you they have not spent half as much time as I have lying next to my sweet son.

            "selftext": "A couple weeks ago I posted about a scary anatomy scan.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/9kgdrl/bad\\_news\\_at\\_ultrasound/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/9kgdrl/bad_news_at_ultrasound/)\n\nA bunch of people asked for an update, and I think I'm ready to give you that update.  Warning, it is not good news - I wish I had better news to share.  \n\nThe MRI confirmed that my baby's brain was not properly forming and part of her cerebellum was in the spinal column (Type 2 Arnold Chiari malformation).  This was causing hydrocephalus (build up of fluid in the brain).  The doctors were certain that this abnormality was being caused because of spina bifida.  Although the doctors hadn't found it on the scan, the MRI was able to see a myelomeningocele (open spina bifida).  Moreover, the radiologist was unable to find an anus that connected to her rectum and confirmed that her bladder was strangely small.  The prognosis was not good.  I was devastated - but I looked into the possibility of fetal surgery.  Unfortunately, I was not a candidate for surgery.  After some soul searching with my husband, we decided to terminate the pregnancy at 21 weeks 6 days.  I never thought I would be in a position where termination was on the table - let alone chosen.  This was a greatly wanted pregnancy FFS.  I had felt her moving and kicking and whenever I think about her safe and warm in my womb moving around I am simply overwhelmed with grief now that she is gone.  I am trying to remain positive and thankfully I have a wonderful daughter who is keeping me occupied - but for now, I am just sad.  There really is no other way to describe what it feels like to end a pregnancy that was supposed to end with a joyful infant and the completion of your family other than sad.  I'm sad.\n\nThank you to everyone who was thoughtful and kind in their responses.  I read each one.",

We have been at odds about many things, but this takes the cake.\n\nI had a friend reach out to me stating that there were a couple videos posted on Facebook of my daughter taking a pole dancing (\"fitness\") class with my ex husband's girlfriend. I was gobsmacked. There's, my daughter, dressed scantily, wrapped around a pole, doing body rolls, the works. She's six. SIX.\n\nI reached out to my ex and tried to, as calmly as possible, tell him I did not approved and it needs to stop. Pole fitness is a great work out. For adults. Those over 18. Those who understand what they're doing. His response was to tell me this is her passion and we need to support her. Again, she's six. Her passion is Pokemon and her pets. She has never once mentioned this passion of hers to me, and she tells me pretty much everything. \n\nHe refused to stop taking her to these classes, but at least had the decency to ask to have to videos removed from Facebook. He states she will continue her classes with more discretion. \n\nI don't know what to do. I worry about what kind of environment my daughter is in when she's with him. He has a lot of personal interests that are not appropriate when a child is around. Can I do anything? I have majority custody/time share. ",

            "selftext": "We have three great kids, ages 9, 6 and 1.5 (boy, girl, boy). Having the third kid was a big discussion and involved some arguing and extensive discussions. I felt like I was done with having more kids but she felt differently. Ultimately, we decided to have another. He\u2019s a great kid but was a difficult baby.\n\nNow, I feel like we\u2019re back to the same place again almost 3 years later. She keeps telling me she wants another kid. Except, this time I know I am 100% done having more children. \n\nThere are many reasons for this. I like our family dynamic currently. Our older kids get along well with each other and they also love taking care of the youngest. I\u2019m finally at the point in my career where I can slow down a little bit and spend more time with our current children. For the last decade I\u2019ve seen them very little due to long hours and working weekends. I know having another baby will just take more time away from them and, instead, I\u2019d like to focus on improving my relationship with my existing kids. And finally, when it comes down to it I just dislike having newborn babies. I don\u2019t enjoy the sleep deprivation and the toll it takes my relationship with my wife.\n\nI have explained this thoroughly to my wife but her only argument is, \u201cBut I want another one.\u201d Every time I say that I don\u2019t, I am accused of not loving my current kids. Now she is going so far as getting my mother and sister involved, who keep telling me to just have one more to make her happy. Again, when I tell them I don\u2019t want another I am accused of not loving my current kids. I don\u2019t think this is a fair argument.\n\nI\u2019m curious to know if other people have found themselves in similar situations and what happened. Everyone I have told about this has said essentially, \u201cWell, if your wife wants another then you\u2019re going to have one.\u201d I just don\u2019t think I should be coerced into having a child that I don\u2019t want. It\u2019s also not a joke to me, but everyone else seems to think it is. ",

            "selftext": "I am a single mum of 16 year old. She never had any behavioural problems, always been helping at home and never had any problems at school, recently she started studying for her a-levels. She found herself a part time job in local pet store when she was 15 and until two day ago I believed that this was what she was doing during weekends (and going out with her BF). last week i got a bit suspicious when she bought herself new mobile phone- I found an invoice and she paid for her phone nearly as much as i make in a month. later that day i questioned her about where she had the money from. Lease don't get me wrong- I just wanted to be sure that she did not borrowed anything as my ex left us with enough debts to pay. anyway, questioning turned into argument. With a very calm voice, she asked me to stop shouting at her and said that she is pregnant. At that moment I completely lost temper. I demanded that she gets rid of it and how she could have done it to me? Before I realised what has just happened she was out the door and on the street. \n\nShe would not answer her phone or reply to my texts. I searched her room to find at least some clue to her whereabouts or what could  she be up to but  what I found has left me completely devastated. On her old phone I found messages she sent to the person who appears to be child's father. She clearly knew that she is pregnant for at least 7-8 weeks (that's when she mentions it for the first time in her texts)  but had no intentions to tell me until much later, she perfectly knew my views on teenage pregnancies and that is one of the reasons why she wanted to hide it from me. The person she's been texting with appears to be much older than my daughter and fully aware of her age but it he is not the only person she's been seeing. There also texts from both men and women arranging for a meeting. \n\nIn her room I found a stash of expensive cosmetics, most of them still sealed and not what I or a young girl could afford or what I'd would expect to find in my daughter's drawer- at least that's what I thought until recently. On her phone I found confirmations from bank of what she's been paying in to her account-  it is cash and much more than she could have made in a pet store working few hours per week. \n\nI am sorry about writing so chaotic but my mind is all over the place. I am tired. I am crying my eyes out and I don't know what is happening to my little girl, where she is or what she got herself into. All kind of thoughts are racing through my mind. She texted my today asking if she can still come home and not to get mad at her.",

            "selftext": "My wife's cousin [41F] used the first season of the tv show Big Mouth as a sex-ed tool for her kids, selling it like it's very educative and good for kids to learn about sex and puberty without having to go through the embarrassment of learning it from their parents or teachers.\n\nHer kids are 12M, 11F &amp; 9F. She played them the first season and sold it to my wife and I like a substitute for sex-ed class. She insisted we let our daughter watch it, but she was only 7 when the first season came out and we didn't think it was appropriate for a kid her age or even to use as a substitute for sex-ed or 'the talk'. We watched the show ourselves and found it funny, but certainly not appropriate for an 8 year old.\n\nSo now there's a second season out and my wife's cousin called saying she's planning a sleepover this weekend for her kids and a few friends to binge watch the first and second seasons. We told her we wouldn't be letting our daughter go because we still think the show is not ok for a kid as young as ours and it may confuse her.\n\nShe went over our heads anyway and talked to our daughter, told her her cousins are having a party and are gonna watch cartoons all weekend and eat pizza and ice cream, so of course she got all hyped up and doesn't understand why she isn't allowed to go. She's very mad at us, even after we explained the party was to watch a tv series she\u2019s no ready to watch yet. She understands this in general, she understands why she can\u2019t watch the same horror movies her cousins watch, we explained how some things are not age appropriate, she knows if she watches horror stuff she\u2019ll have nightmares. We don\u2019t allow her to watch Family Guy or American Dad either and the few times she\u2019s watched it at her cousins\u2019 house she\u2019s been quite shocked about it, as much as she\u2019s able to get the jokes, of course she doesn\u2019t really know half the stuff is going on.\n\nThe thing is I was at work yesterday and this situation was brought up, a couple of my coworkers said my wife and I were being too harsh and prudish, depriving our girl of a fun party just because she\u2019s not allowed to watch the show. It really got me thinking, are we actually in the wrong here? We offered to take her to the party, let her eat pizza, play, and bring her back home when the other kids would start watching the show, we even offered to take her to the movies instead, but she says she rather not go then.\n\nAt the end of the day if we say no it's a no, we as her parents decide what we think is best for her, but we\u2019re trying to be open and don\u2019t really know if we are on the wrong about this one. On the other hand, we\u2019re so mad at my wife\u2019s cousin for telling her about the party after knowing we wouldn\u2019t let her go. She\u2019s always pulling shit like this and it\u2019s got to the point we\u2019re thinking about cutting ties with her even if only for a while, but our daughter loves playing with her cousins and tbh that\u2019s the only thing stopping us from going no contact.\n\nTL;DR Wife\u2019s cousin is having a sex-ed party to binge watch the tv series Big Mouth and wanted to invite our 8 y.o. daughter. After we said we wouldn\u2019t let her go, she managed to talk to our daughter and got her all excited about the party. Our daughter is mad at us now for ruining the fun and I\u2019m not really sure if we\u2019re making a bigger deal about it than it really is.",

We told my son if he was good we would walk by the Halloween section to look at the decorations. \n\nWell, after multiple warnings we decided to stick to our guns and tell him we were going straight to check out. Cue meltdown of the century. \n\nScreaming. Crying. Yelling. I pulled him to an isle to tell him if he did not stop screaming we would be leaving immediately; it\u2019s okay to be disappointed but we can\u2019t yell. \n\nAt this point he decides to push me. So. There went rational parenting. I pick up to carry him out. At which point it somehow gets worse.\n\nLong story short I end up desperately trying to hold on to a freakishly large and incredibly strong toddler as I do the walk/shuffle of shame across the store. \n\nIt was horrible. I\u2019ve never been so disappointed or angry with my child. He\u2019s screaming \u201cI\u2019m too strong\u201d as he pushes himself away and I almost drop him on his head. \n\nThe one thing I wasn\u2019t though was embarrassed. I feel like I was doing exactly what all customers hope parents do. Get the hell out of there as quickly as possible. And every time I saw another woman, I feel like I got such a look of empathy. As if to say, \u201cWe\u2019ve all been there. It\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\nAnd to the woman in the parking lot who graciously told me she has a little one the same age and she understands, thank you. I was seriously about to lose it and it was nice to know we all deal with tyrant children. \n\nSo. In short. My child acted like a demon. Rational parenting failed. And I ended up with that kid that everyone hates to be in a store with. \n\nNow it\u2019s time for wine. ",

            "selftext": "*I am going to be mentioning my beliefs on vaccines in this post. I will also be talking about avoiding illness. I understand that not everyone will agree with me. I just ask we all be respectful of each other :)*\n\nHere in Canada it's Thanksgiving weekend. We were supposed to have Thanksgiving dinner with DH's family. DH's family is very large. FIL is one of six, four of which went on to have families of their own, plus there are now four grand kids - including our two girls. Traditionally, the three siblings with the biggest houses take turns hosting family events.\n\nAnyways,\n\nThis morning we found out one of DH's aunts is just getting over shingles. As in, new blisters stopped forming less than seven days ago. As DD2 has yet to have her Chicken Pox vaccine (she is only 5 months old), we opted to bow out of attending Thanksgiving. We just don't want to take any chances. FIL (who lives with us) has opted out of attending as well. Sure, we feel a little bad that just days before Thanksgiving we are backing out (and we were in charge of bringing our 'famous' cheese plate which is a STAPLE at all family functions). The uncle who is hosting is being understanding about the whole thing, and even offered to host us for a 'makeup dinner' in a few weeks (so we can still visit with them).\n\nNo big deal right?\n\nWrong.\n\nThe aunt in question happens to be an anti-vaxxer....and she thinks we are being ridiculous! Both for avoiding the event because of her...and the whole vaccinating our kids in general part. Plus, my SIL (who has a baby only two months older than DD2 and is also yet to be vaccinated for Chicken Pox) has decided to come anyways (her kids, her choice. I'm not judging...just mentioning it for context).\n\nNow some people (who really want to see our girls) are suggesting that the aunt with shingles just be uninvited...which OF COURSE we don't want to happen because it's not fair for her to be made into a pariah over something out of her control. Vaccinated children (like DD1 and N1) and healthy adults would be fine around her with the proper precautions. \n\nSo now it's this huge 'thing'. Once again, my parenting decisions are being called into question and I'M the 'bad guy'...\n\nAunt is an anti-vaxxer? Whatever. She had her own two kids not to vaccinate. My own Mom was an anti-vaxxer, and as soon as I was an adult I got all my shots. Her adult children have the same option available. But regardless of their choice, I'm not going to comment (to her OR them).\n\nSIL wants to bring her unvaccinated baby around someone who could still have the Chicken Pox virus in her system? Not my place to judge. Her baby, her choice. Just don't expect any playdates until we are 100% sure she isn't going to break out in spots.\n\nDon't you DARE accuse me of RUINING THANKSGIVING because I don't want to take the risk with my own baby! It's JUST a glorified family dinner for fuck sakes! I'm not a 'germaphobe'. I'm not 'pumping my kids full of toxins' or 'brainwashed'. I'm also not just 'trying to cause drama'. I'm NOT a bad Mom for choosing to do something as simple as change my mind on a dinner invitation.\n",

Everything I thought I wanted in life.\n\nI wish I could go back in time and warn myself to never stop taking birth control.\n\nMy daughter is 8 now and my son is 6. The early years were impossible. I had to cut back to part time at the job I loved, permanently stunting my career. I cried constantly. Life became a blur of mind-numbing, monotonous tasks and duties. I kept hearing that things would get easier as they got older, and they did, but I never stopped regretting.\n\nI love my children so much, and I work so hard to keep my feelings hidden from them and everyone but my therapist and my sister. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here. I just need to finally say all this to someone. \n\nI have a sister who never wants children. I used to be in total disbelief over this. I couldn\u2019t imagine life without children in it one day, and I was so sure she would wake up one day, alone and childless, regretting it so much. The tables have turned. Now I see her life and I almost hate her because I want it so much. She travels nonstop. Seriously, she\u2019s been to five countries this year, which she can afford because she\u2019s rising up in her career. She lives in an apartment in the heart of a trendy downtown area because she is in no hurry to buy a house in the suburbs. She spends her weekends with friends, going to breweries or festivals or concerts. She\u2019s genuinely happy with her life and I\u2019m so bitter with jealously that it hurts just to check her Facebook and see what new, fun thing she\u2019s doing. \n\nI never should have become a mother, but there\u2019s no taking it back now. I\u2019m trying to carve out more time for myself, but it\u2019s a band-aid. I\u2019m always weighed down by my responsibilities, and even when I get away from home, all I can think about is what\u2019s waiting for me when I return.\n",

            "selftext": "Like the title says, I have no idea what to do. I\u2019m a mom of four children, the fourteen year old being my oldest, my other kids are 9 (f), 7 (m), and my youngest just turned two (f). My daughter is successful in school, she just started her freshman year of high school, seems to have a good social circle of friends (not getting into anything questionable, and her dad and I like her friends) and is seemingly not doing anything out of character for a 14 year old girl. I found out she is pregnant last Saturday morning, when I found a receipt and part of a wrapper while cleaning our downstairs bathroom for a first response pregnancy test. I had taken her to a Walgreens clinic last month because she was nauseous and having headaches (which clearly went right over my head, her being pregnant didn\u2019t even cross my mind) and the doctor had said it might be hormonal, stress, but nothing to give her and after a well check didn\u2019t find anything wrong. I had no idea she was even sexual active, and we have been pretty open with her and our nine year old daughter, because we want our children to be well informed and feel like they\u2019re able to talk with us and come to us. My 14 year old is well aware of contraception options, that birth control isn\u2019t 100% and you can get pregnant even if he doesn\u2019t ejaculate, etc. My daughter has always been boy crazy since we can remember and has had \u201cboyfriends\u201d in elementary school and middle school but we weren\u2019t concerned because it was an innocent crush. I knew back in early summer of this year she was dating a boy, but always seeing him with friends, never one on one. My parents were extremely religous and strict and I wasn\u2019t allowed to date until I moved out at 18 and met my now husband, and so I\u2019ve tried to give her a lot of freedom without letting her do whatever she wants, maybe that was my mistake. On Saturday I waited until her dad was at work and her siblings except were at my sisters house. I took her through the coffee bean drive thru and tried to make it a date with her and I, since we don\u2019t often have one on one time. I asked her about what I had found and she froze up and started getting ready eyed until she was sobbing. I wasn\u2019t prepared and didn\u2019t even know what to say, and after letting her cry I asked her when this happened, was it positive, who was the boy, etc. My daughter said it was the boy she was dating in summer who also goes to her school, they started having sex in summer at his house when no one was home, when she said she was with friends. I asked her what she thinks her options are and she said she doesn\u2019t want to have an abortion (she\u2019s probably too far long anyway) or give the baby up for adoption. I\u2019m taking her to the obgyn tomorrow, but doing the math she thinks she\u2019d be around 14 weeks pregnant. She\u2019s always been thin but looks significantly older than her age, and has always gotten a lot of attention from men, and she isn\u2019t showing even a little bit. The dad is a year older so around 15 or 16. I feel like such a failure as a parent, and I know her dad will be devastated and so beyond disappointed. She\u2019s always been a daddy\u2019s girl and I know it will break his heart. I had her pretty young, my husband and I married right before I turned 19 and had her at 19. But 19 years old is a world of a lot different than 14, she won\u2019t be 15 until May. We are very blessed and my husband works a very high paying job and we can afford a big house and everything our kids need, but we didn\u2019t want anymore kids (our two year old was a surprise) and essentially we will be stuck raising another baby. I don\u2019t know how we\u2019re going to tell her dad, she hasn\u2019t told the guy who got her pregnant yet or anyone except her best friend, and I just don\u2019t know what to do. She seems happy but scared, and she told me about a YouTube she watches Maddie and everly, who is a 15 year old girl that just had a baby and it worries me too that this might not have been an accident. I\u2019m sorry if this is long and scrambled it\u2019s just how I\u2019m feeling right now, I never thought we would be dealing with this and now I\u2019m terrified she\u2019s going to set an example for her siblings.

            "selftext": " So our daughter was asked out on a date. \n\n My husband travels a lot for work and is gone for months at a time. On Skype I was telling him about the date, and he said that he does not want her dating at all until she graduates high school.  I know that us as parents have to accept that she\u2019s growing up.  I also told him that I might put her on birth control when she feels ready to be sexually active;  he said this is just giving her an opportunity to go out and have sex with whoever she wants. \n\n I completely disagree with my husband.  Providing birth control is teaching safe sex; and usually sex is in the spur of the moment, so I want her to be prepared, whether thats now or 10 years from now. I was never allowed to date until after HS and I feel as if that robbed me from certain experiences that would\u2019ve helped me later down the line (e.g dealing with heartbreak). \n\n He also says that a boy will be distracting to school work and that he doesn\u2019t want her to become obsessed.  Our daughter is a straight A student and teachers only say good things about her.  Now if she starts dating someone and her grades go down then that would be an issue, but I don\u2019t think it will be.\n\nHow can my husband and I come to a compromise?",

The biggest issue is the fact that I\u2019m doing something illegal despite all of my lectures about staying away from dangerous drugs and alcohol. In the past I have presented MJ as a helpful drug, like Tylenol or ibuprofen but that it can still be abused.

            "selftext": "My son has been in the same church run daycare/preschool for about a year. At the time, we didn't love the place, but we were desperate because I needed to go back to work and it was the only place that would work with my part time schedule. (We didn't love it because it didn't seem as academic as others, but he was only two so we let it go).\n\nHe seems to really like it there. Most days he doesn't even say goodbye to me, he just runs into which ever room they have setup and starts playing. He seems to like some kids and teachers more than others, but that seems normal enough. He occasionally has rough/clingy mornings, but they are pretty rare and seem to correlate with story time on Fridays, but not every Friday.\n\nI'm not sure if some of his new behaviors are unusual or just par for the course for a toddler/threenager. He never used to mind diaper changes, but started kicking and screaming during them sometimes after he started at the daycare. He's always been a strong willed kid, but screaming \"I don't want to\" and \"put me down\" are things he picked up at daycare for whatever reason. I thought it was odd that the church pastor would be reading to the kids sometimes when I dropped my kid off on Fridays, and even weirder that he sometimes had kids in his lap, but the teachers were always there, it was always a group activity with 10+ kids, and I was pretty much always running late so I didn't think much of it.\n\nWe had some concerns, but nothing concrete and more that our otherwise sweet boy was learning to hit/push than anything worse. Until today. We finish up dinner and I get the bath ready for our 1 year old, leaving the 3 year old at the dinner table with my husband. I'm minding my business, bathing the baby when my husband comes into the bathroom to relay something the 3 year old just did and said. It should be noted that our toddler doesn't yet speak in complete sentences or fully respond when  asked questions (ex \"what did you do at school today?\" gets no answer while \"did you paint at school today?\" garners an appropriate \"yep!\" or \"nope!\"). Our toddler had finished his dinner and, after we had cleaned up his plate, he asked for peanut butter pretzels, one of his favorite snacks. Normally, we'd say no, but he'd been a good kid all day so my husband said \"sure! But cheek kiss first\" and leaned into our normally very affectionate kiddo. Our son slapped my husband across the face and said \"no! Pretzels now!\". Not great, but not out of the ordinary for him after a long day (we don't hit our kids, but he definitely struggles with hitting when he's frustrated). He did/said this twice and then said \"get candy!\". My husband said \"no candy right now\" and then asked \"do you get candy at school?\" expecting him to say \"no\". Our son then grabbed two of my husband's fingers, rubbed the tips with his fingers several times, said \"it's round, it's round\" and then licked them repeatedly. He did this several times. (Just typing this is making me nauseous again). My husband asked if that's how he got candy and our son repeated the behavior/motion and then put his finger to his lips and said \"shhhh!\", then put his other pointer finger to my husband's lips and said \"shhhh!\" (We only ever use \"shhh\" to comfort them when crying and have never put our fingers to his or our lips). My husband tried to gently ask more questions, but our son just mumbled nonsense and then asked to get out of his highchair.\n\nMy husband came and told me immediately and we got the baby out of the tub, and tried to talk to the toddler again, but he'd moved on and just wanted to go sit on the couch. We didn't know what to do (this was around 730pm), so we called local PD dispatch and they sent over an officer who just told us to speak to the director of the school.\n\nI've tried searching this sub and others and have come across a few sort of related posts, but I have no idea what to do. Local resources open in the morning, and we have already told our workplaces that we won't be in tomorrow due to a family emergency, but we don't know where to start. I can't in good conscience send him back there again.\n\nAre we overreacting? Do we just confront the director? How do we handle this? I obviously don't know what or who exactly, but this definitely seems off. Any thoughts or advice would be appreciated.\n\n",

            "selftext": "My daughter and I have been on a bit of a music kick the last two weeks. We started with the (early) Beatles and she loved them, lots of energy and dancing. We graduated to some 70\u2019s folk and she loved that too. Then I thought she would probably love some of the high energy 80\u2019s songs.... Big mistake. I played Meatloafs beautiful \u201cI\u2019d do anything for love\u201d. The rest of the night was punctuated by random hums and broken lyrics to the song. First thing next morning (and I do mean first), she makes me up asking to hear the \u201clove song\u201d. So I make some coffee, turn the stereo on (7:20 am), and play her new favorite song with a healthy level of volume. The second it\u2019s over she asks me to play it again. \u201cWhy not\u201d I think. After getting her ready and listening to it two more times on her behest we pack the car ride for daycare. Fast forward to picking her up: as soon as I walk in I notice something strange is going on. Her teacher instantly gives me the biggest FU grin I\u2019ve ever seen in my life. Apparently my little one was singing \u201cI would do anything for love\u201d on repeat for the entire day and even got most of the class to do the same. The teacher even downloaded and played the edited version so the kids could understand what she was singing. I gave a nervous smile to the teacher after being semi-scolded in front of a daycare class. The rest of the night was all talk about her new favorite song. It\u2019s been like this the last two days. \n\n\nI\u2019ve broken my daughter. I\u2019m afraid Zeppelin is the only thing that can save her now. ",

            "selftext": "My husband and I have been going back and forth on whether or not we should try for another child. We have a wonderful 4 year old son and our life as a family of 3 is pretty simple and sweet. We have been feeling the pressure on both sides of our families to have another with the main reasons being that our son needs a sibling &amp; that the age gap will be too much if we wait any longer.\n\nPersonally, I am content with being one and done with my son, but the fantasy of having another (especially a daughter) did linger in my mind. As luck would have it, I was asked by a close friend if I could take care of her 3mo baby daughter for 3 days while she attended a funeral a few states away. I excitedly said yes thinking what a perfect opportunity this would be to experience what life would be like if we had just had a baby.\n\nThe first day went fine, the baby was sleepy through out the day and hardly fussed. My son enjoyed showing his toys to her &amp; helped prepare her bottles. Husband loves playing with her and making her coo. I could still change diapers like a pro, but my burping technique was pretty rusty. She slept in 2-4 hour intervals and I was feeling confident that this would be a piece of cake.\n\nThen Day 2 hit. My husband had already left for work so I was flying solo. I woke up to a shrieking baby and she had a massive poopy diaper blowout. The poor thing had poop halfway up her back and it had leaked out into her bassinet. Immediately I ran a bath and got her cleaned up but her crying did not stop. My son shows up asking for breakfast in the middle of this and won\u2019t stop asking me why the whole room smells like crap. I\u2019m still bleary eyed from waking with the baby last night, so I ask him if he could please make himself a bowl of cereal. He refuses and starts to whine. I\u2019m frustrated so I tell him to wait in his room and when his breakfast is ready I\u2019ll call him down. Baby is out of the bath but still crying, she\u2019s hungry. I take a deep breath and get her dressed so I can get her bottle ready. I get the bottle made and start feeding her but she is having a hard time settling down to drink so it takes a good 20 minutes for her to finish it. Afterwards I try to burp her and she proceeds to spit up half the bottle down my shirt. Oh god.\n\nI get her and myself cleaned off as best as I can and rock her to sleep. I collapse on the couch and close my eyes for a few seconds when I hear the tearful voice of my son. \n\n\u201cMama...can I please have something to eat now?\u201d \n\nA good hour had passed since I sent him to his room to wait for breakfast. I had completely forgotten him in the chaos of a 3mo baby. As I made him his breakfast, exhausted and still smelling sour from the spit up dried in my hair, I realized the fantasy I had in my mind of another baby was no where near as wonderful as the reality of my life in a family of 3. \n",

            "selftext": "[**TL;DR**: My son violently threw our old, frail cat against a wall. I scolded him for it and my husband stuck up for him and ended up calling me a bitch. He then unilaterally decided that our son was better off at my MIL's house. MIL will not let me see my son.]\n\nIn just under 24 hours, our otherwise quiet family life has been tossed into total disarray and I have no idea where to turn. Sorry, this is gonna be a long one.\n\nMy husband (\"Hal\") and I have three pets: one older dog that he brought to the marriage, a rescue dog we got two years ago, and a very old cat that I adopted while I was in college. The cat has always been a bone of contention in our relationship -- Hal only tolerates her because he doesn't like cats but understands how much she means to me.\n\nWe have an eight-year-old son (\"Malcolm\"). He behaves well in school and has had a pretty good start to this school year despite crying himself to sleep every night all summer following the death of his grandpa, my father-in-law.\n\nNow my cat does not like Malcolm at all. She is not aggressive and has never lashed out at him, but she does hiss and gets worked up when he is around. We have tried to get her used to Malcolm and after he was born even talked about giving her to relatives, but we decided that as long as she is not violent towards him, we ought to just leave well enough alone.\n\nYesterday afternoon, the three of us were sitting in the living room and Malcolm was talking to us about his day at school. He was a little upset because of something one of his teachers said and we were comforting him. The cat walked into the room and perched herself on the coffee table so she could hiss at Malcolm. Then out of nowhere, Malcolm stood up, walked over to the cat, grabbed her up by one of her front paws, full-on slammed her against the wall, and yelled \"STOP IT!\" as she tumbled to the floor and bolted out of the room, yowling. When I say slammed I do mean slammed - it was as if he was throwing a basketball at the wall. It was so violent.\n\nI was screaming my head off while Hal just sat and watched. I grabbed Malcolm by the shoulders, looked him in the eyes and told him forcefully that it was NEVER okay to use violence against animals. Then I went off to see about the cat, who had gone to hide under the bed. She was really shaken and wouldn't let me get near her at first, but when I got the chance to look her over she seemed okay.\n\nI went to see Malcolm in his room to continue the conversation and he was bawling. I reiterated that it was not okay to treat an animal like that and that animals don't understand that kind of treatment. He told me I should just calm down and that it was just a cat. We went back and forth for a while until I got him to settle down and he told me he understood that what he did was wrong.\n\nThen Hal came in and sat down on our son's bed. He explained to Malcolm that everything was okay and that I am just sensitive about the cat. This pissed me off because yes I'm sensitive about the cat, but also it's fucking NOT okay to throw a cat at a wall. We went into another room so our son wouldn't hear us arguing. He told me that boys will be boys and that he used to play like that with the family cat growing up. I told him I couldn't believe he was defending such an action and that \"boys will be boys\" is bullshit.\n\nWe continued to argue -- and I should mention we very seldom clash over anything -- and were basically screaming at the top of our lungs for a good 30 minutes within earshot of Malcolm, which I regret. I told Hal that children who don't learn how to treat animals often grow up with violent tendencies towards people. He let out a sarcastic laugh and called me a \"fucking psychotic bitch\". He has never said anything like that to me before. He told me I should be \"on my knees thanking him\" for agreeing not to give the cat away in the first place. Then he said I was being a bad parent by getting so worked up over \"something so trivial as a cat\", and then I lost control and had to leave the room.\n\nI had no idea what to do with myself as we had never had such a big fight. Hal ended up taking Malcolm over to my MIL's house and I can only imagine how he relayed the events to her (he is a total mama's boy).\n\nHe returned later last night and told me MIL agreed to keep Malcolm until things got straightened out. I wanted to yell at him some more but I had no energy left. He went to sleep in on the couch and we have only exchanged a couple of words since then. He will presumably be coming home from work soon and I can't even begin to imagine what to say to him.\n\nI want to see my son. I want to apologize for becoming hysterical and explain to him that even though I love him with all my heart, I want him to understand that animals have feelings too and must be treated with kindness. But I called MIL about an hour ago and she reported that Malcolm \"isn't interested\" in seeing me.\n\nThis is absolutely unbearable and I have no idea what to do. My heart is absolutely broken. I can't eat. Am I in the wrong? Am I being a bad mother/wife? How can the three of us work through what has happened and move on? I feel like a bitch and a bad mother and that because of my emotional attachment to the cat, I have wrecked our family. I want to die.\n\nAnd, to be honest, I'm so traumatized by the way my husband spoke to me that I'm not sure I'll be able to look him in the eyes when he gets home.",

We were alone. \"You know how we were over for dinner the other day, and you called someone a dumbass?\"\n\n\"I called Donald Trump a dumbass,\" I said. \"But only because he is.\"\n\n\"Well, yesterday, my son was in the playroom, and I heard him call one of his toy trucks a dumbass.\"\n\nHe then pursed his lips and stared at me with a look of shock. Because this was my fault.\n\nI suppose I could have been a bigger man at that point. I suppose I could have chosen to nod, smile, say I will keep that in mind. I guess I'm just not built like that.\n\n\"Did you talk to him?\" I asked. \"I mean, he should never call a truck a dumbass.\"\n\nHe nodded. \"I know. We had a long discussion. I said --\"\n\n\"Because,\" I said, still demonstrating that concern was figuratively bubbling out of my pores, \"a truck is an inanimate object.\"\n\n\"What does that have to do--\"\n\n\"Maybe he was calling the\u00a0*driver*\u00a0of the toy truck a dumbass?

Okay, maybe you need to teach your kid about context. Did you cover that in your discussion?\"\n\nActually, this went on for a little bit more because, as most Good Parents are, he was oblivious to sarcasm. But we were interrupted by his wife, who came out of the john. Judging by the look  on her face as she  said it was time to leave, I think this whole thing was orchestrated by her.\u00a0*I'll cough, and excuse myself to go to the bathroom. That's when you confront him and his potty mouth*. Or else she was \u00a0constipated.

Hubby returned back downstairs and continued eating his dinner over the sink. I asked whether the toddler was in the bath, to which he replied \"Yup\" and kept eating. I was furious and told him to get back upstairs now. He said that he'll be alright, he's OK. I protested and he went back upstairs. \n\nYeah sure, our toddler has never had an incident in the bath before. He's never slipped, hit his head, been stuck underwater or turned the hot tap on himself. That doesn't mean it won't happen and that's what supervision is there to prevent. \n\nThe fact that he thinks it's ok to be on a different room while the toddler is in the bath let alone a different LEVEL just floors me. There's too much to lose to risk leaving him alone in the bath.\n\nI feel like this is parenting 101 and he is behaving like I'm overreacting. I'd love some honest feedback - what do you think?

            "selftext": "We recently attended a back to school/meet your teacher night for our kindergartener. He attended preschool there also, so other than a new teacher and classroom, it\u2019s basically the same as last year. My kiddo did great in PreK, loved his teachers and made a very lovely little group of friends; all great kids with good parents. Well, this year at meet the teacher night, his kindergarten teacher lead all the parents and kids in prayer and referenced Jesus Christ and the Lord a handful of times. My husband and I are agnostic, but not anti Christian. We don\u2019t feel strongly about religion or Christianity in general, but we do feel strongly that God is too complex a concept for our five year old; and we feel that promoting any religion (or lack thereof) is inappropriate for a child of this age. It just seems more like conditioning them to follow our beliefs, and we want them to choose for themselves. Anyway, I\u2019m conflicted because I know most of the other parents hold strong Christian beliefs, and I don\u2019t want to be \u201cTHAT MOM\u201d, but my kid goes to public school. I thought we wouldn\u2019t have to worry about it since that kind of specific religious type stuff wasn\u2019t allowed in public school?  We now feel like we are being forced into having a conversation about god earlier than is appropriate for our child\u2019s development. I mean, god is a rather profound concept for a five year old. Trying to explain it when he asks questions in a way he will understand is a challenge. I don\u2019t know that they\u2019ve prayed in class, but he has come asking about things like heaven and hell and seems to be having a slight existential crisis, concerned that he is going to hell because he wasn\u2019t baptized and confused about how if there a \u201cgreat god\u201d why it would have let his grandpa die, or let his school friend have psoriasis, why god lets bad things like hurricanes and flood happen. I\u2019m at a loss as to what to do. I don\u2019t want to push him in either direction, belief or non belief, and I\u2019m miffed that we are having to deal with this at all. And of course it could have been one of the other kids who brought it up, just seems weird that he made it all thru last year with no issues with it and then after the prayer at B2S night he suddenly had all these fears and questions. I\u2019m aware that I\u2019m drawing parallels which may or may not be related. I also don\u2019t want to ostracize him from his friends or their families, since being a non believer is akin to actively worshipping Satan and participating in cannibalism in our town. I\u2019ve tried broaching the subject like \u201csome people believe this and some believe that\u201d and discuss many different religions (this weekend we covered Judaism and Hindu) but again, it\u2019s seems like a lot for a five year old. Thoughts?  Is it worth a school meeting?  Will I ruin my kid\u2019s reputation if I \u201cout\u201d my husband and me as non believers?  Should I just shut up and except that my kid is eventually going to get brainwashed?\n\nTL,DR:  Public school teacher prayed and referenced Jesus at back to school night, now our kid thinks he\u2019s going to hell because he\u2019s not baptized.

            "selftext": "Posting on a throwaway because I have identifying info on my other account. My son was a god-awful sleeper as a baby, so I\u2019m especially sensitive to this issue. \n\nMy sister, her husband and their 2-month-old daughter are staying with us for the next week. They have dealt with reflux issues as well as good old fashioned colic, and sleep is very precious to them. I\u2019ve been helping out at night by keeping the monitor in my bedroom; if I hear niece cry, I go tend to her and let my sister and BIL sleep. My sister tearfully confided in me the other day that she\u2019s dreading leaving, because the sleep she\u2019s gotten the past few days has been a complete life-saver. I suspect she\u2019s struggling with PPD on top of sleep deprivation, so I\u2019ve even looked into what it would cost to hire her a night nanny a few times a week. \n\nSo two nights ago, I woke up in the middle of the night to a commotion and a crying baby (that I could hear from down the hall, because the monitor had been taken out of my room by my son), and you can imagine my frustration when I realized my son went into the room my niece is staying in and flipped the lights on and off as a \u2018prank\u2019. \n\nI have no clue why this prank is funny, but I know he got the idea from YouTube, so that\u2019s banned for a while for sure, and I\u2019m still deciding whether I\u2019m taking his phone (which he used to film the prank). But I didn\u2019t think that would be enough, so last night at midnight I went into my son\u2019s room, woke him up, brought him downstairs, and made him hand-wash dishes. I watched from the doorway as he complained and cried that he was tired and this wasn\u2019t fair and couldn\u2019t he just do this in the morning, and my only response was \u2018you should\u2019ve thought about that before you disturbed your cousin\u2019s sleep for no reason last night\u2019. About two hours later I let him go back up to bed after more chores, because that\u2019s how long it took me to get my niece back to sleep. \n\nMy husband slept through all this, by the way. And has been sleeping through the rest of my niece\u2019s wakings this week. And slept through the majority of my son\u2019s night wakings when he was a baby. So I personally don\u2019t feel that he gets to complain that my punishment was \u2018too harsh\u2019. He said our son needs his sleep, and that taking away YouTube should\u2019ve been sufficient. He said I\u2019m no better than the parents who make their kids stand on street corners with signs detailing their wrongdoings, and that shame isn\u2019t an efficient parenting tactic. \n\nI don\u2019t think I \u2018shamed\u2019 my son, I think my punishment fit the crime, but I do hope he\u2019s ashamed of himself because he did something unkind on purpose. What do you guys think, was I too harsh? I really don\u2019t think I was but if the majority of opinions here are that I was, I\u2019ll take that into consideration. I just don\u2019t think my husband gets much of a say here considering it wasn\u2019t his sleep that was disturbed. ",

In the past when toys go missing under the couch I've fetched them with a hanger or whatever long object is handy. This time the ball had gone much deeper. So I said hey I'll lift the couch from one end and you get in there and grab your ball. She agreed and seemed to know exactly where the ball had rolled. The couch is a long 3-seater and weighs a ton. It's not something you can hold up in the air for longer than a few seconds, which is how much time I thought we'd need. I assumed she'd be in and out in a second. So I lifted it up high enough for her to crawl underneath. As soon as I lifted it up she saw another one of her toys that's been missing for a while. She went in deeper and picks up the other toy, which is damaged. She decides to throw a tantrum right there under the couch and starts crying that her toy is broken. I yelled at her to GET OUT!! I CAN'T HOLD IT MUCH LONGER! The louder I yelled, the louder she cried. Nothing I said helped, and she wasn't ready to come out no matter what. I was doing my best to use my feet to kick her out but they wouldn't reach her. All the yelling was making her cry even more, and my back was killing me at this point. There was no way to move the couch far enough away from her because of other furniture nearby. I couldn't even see exactly where she was underneath. Luckily a tragedy was avoided. My wife came running from another room when she heard the commotion and pulled our daughter out to safety. I dread to think how this would've ended had it not been for the wife rescue. I decided to post this as a cautionary tale....don't ever ask your kid to crawl under a couch while you're holding it up in the air.",

No doctor could risk getting it out. So now I'm basically sitting on a time bomb that could go off any minute. I got about three more months to live. Maybe even four or five, if I'm lucky. I won't burden you with details about what it means to live knowing this. Harder than accepting this was only the thought that my son will grow up without a father.\nMy son is just 4 years old, and one of my biggest fears now is that he won't remember me when he grows up. I mean, what do you remember from that age? I won't be able to teach him so many things about life, he's just too young to understand most of them. But even after I die, I want him to think about me, to know me. I realize that my wife will probably find someone else, another man, after I die. And I have to admit, I'd be happy if she found an honorable man to be with. But I don't want that other man to replace me, to erase all son's memories about me. What would you do? What would you do to stay in your child's life as long as possible?",

            "selftext": "Thanks for the advice on [the original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/95cude/18_year_old_daughter_assaulted_25_year_old/) \n\nMy wife and I spent a lot of time discussing what we were going to do about what happened. Megan is (for the moment) staying at Sam's parents, while Melissa is being kept in the hospital because her asthma symptoms are persisting. \n\nWe eventually decided that Megan should be our priority at the moment. Some of the people on the other post seemed to think we had ''favouritism'' towards Melissa. That isn't the case, we love them both. However, I will admit that Melissa got more attention than Megan did when they were little, simply because her medical problems were a huge worry for us. I think most people would agree that making a sick child's care your priority is not immoral. That said, it was absolutely wrong that we treated Melissa too leniently in her behaviour towards her sister. We should have made clear that her remarks about Megan's appearance and her relationship with Sam were not acceptable. If we'd done that than maybe things wouldn't have gotten this far. \n\nWe went to see Melissa in hospital yesterday and told her what was going to happen. We told her that if she makes an effort to get Megan arrested, then Sam will report the unwanted kiss as sexual assault, and we would back him up. We also stated that we would not give any statement supporting her accusation against Megan. \n\nMelissa then started to sob and said we were being unfair to her, and said that we were siding with Megan and were letting Megan  get away with hurting her. \n\nWe also told her that at the moment, Megan was our priority. Melissa has a fully established career whereas Megan has only just got a job. Melissa makes enough money that she could easily get her own place if she wanted, which is why we're going to let Megan stay with Sam for two months, during which time we expect Melissa to get her stuff together and find somewhere of her own. \n\nMelissa was horrified and upset when she heard this. We tried to comfort her and told her we will help her with anything she needs. We said we'd help her find a place if she wanted and that we'd still be involved in her life. She was crying her eyes out at this point and said that she was being punished for getting attacked. He mother tried to soothe her and assure her that we love her, but she said that if we loved her we wouldn't be kicking her out. \n\nAt this point she was distressed and her asthma symptoms started to come back. She was breathing heavily and I called someone. Even as she was struggling and we were ushered away we could tell how heartbroken she was and it  was painful for us. \n\nWhile I think this is the best thing we can do, I'm not necessarily sure it's the right thing. Melissa, while financially sound, is emotionally dependent on us and I'm not sure she could cope on her own. Even so, Megan is our priority now and we have to do what's best for her, and we've also started talking about getting her therapy if that's what she wants, and hopefully in a few years we can work towards some kind of peace between the sisters. \n\nDid we do the right thing?",

            "selftext": "When my daughter turned 12 in August we took her to the doctor to get a series of immunizations. One of those was chickenpox and the doctor was very specific and telling us that it takes 3 weeks between when you receive the vaccine and when you are immune.\n\nA week after she received the shot we were visiting the Hands-On Museum in my town and there is a small room there for children under 18 months of age. There were maybe eight parents in there and a dozen kids.\n\nWe get to talkin and one of the parents got into an argument on their cell phone and it was overheard that they did not get their child the chickenpox vaccine, they don't believe in vaccines, and they want their child's immune system to \"learn the natural way\"\n\nWell, a few of the parents heard that and considering that most of the children in this room were of infant age, people started to freak out. The staff of the science museum ended up escorting them out of the building while they pitched a fit and made a scene not understanding what the problem is.\n\nQuite obviously, the problem is that they took an actively infected child with chickenpox to an infant room, children who are too young to get the vaccine or have just got it and therefore most of them are susceptible, and an illness like that, while relatively routine to you and I can be very hazardous for an infant.\n\nWell, you guessed it. My daughter ended up getting chicken pox. The doctor was outraged and the science museum had to put out a bulletin about what happened. I asked the doctor what's going to happen and they said that her immune system started fighting the disease as soon as she got the shot, so she essentially had a head start on fighting the illness.\n\nShe is sick, but it is nowhere near as bad as what it could be. Being that she's only 12 months old she doesn't know what's going on, and trying to keep a child that young from scratching? Good luck.\n\nHonestly, I am so incredibly ticked off right now I don't even know where to begin. I think we should take all the anti-vaxxers and put them on an island together, that way they can all die from easily preventable diseases. Oh, we wouldn't be inhumane about it. We would airdrop in food water and Medicine... well, the medicine will be in the form of hypodermic needles carrying the vaccination hahahaha!!\n\nSeriously though, this is it a prime example of why you need to give vaccinated. Because you are literally assaulting other innocent children by your crappy parenting and putting her life in danger. You can make all the decisions you want as a parent that affects your kid and I really don't care, but when your decision starts affecting my kid? Now we got a problem",

            "selftext": "Decided to put this here because I don't feel comfortable telling my friends about this. \n\nMy wife and I have two daughters. Melissa, 25 and Megan, 18. Melissa works in banking in the city while Megan recently started working at a hairdresser not far from our house.  \n\nThe girls have always had a bit of a ''sibling rivalry'' but are generally civil to each other. They have very different personalities. Melissa is very girly and a proper princess, but also very smart and confident, whereas Megan is a bit tomboyish and while talented, isn't really academic which is why she chose to get a job after leaving school rather than pursuing higher education. Their mother and me are very proud of both of their achievements. \n\nMegan also recently got together with Sam, her best friend from school. We're happy for them as he's a decent guy. Melissa has always enjoyed winding up her little sister, and over the past few weeks has taken to mocking their relationship for some reason. We've warned her not to be cruel but she doesn't really listen. The two have not done anything but argue over the past few weeks, and Melissa has questioned why Sam doesn't find someone more attractive, and is constantly telling Megan that he could ''do better'' than her. She was close to tears because of this. \n\nOn Saturday Megan and Sam were hanging out in the garden while I was sorting out some old equipment in the shed. My wife and Melissa came to join us. The girls started arguing again after Melissa said ''Hey ugly'' to her sister. As they argued Melissa said she was going to ''prove'' that Sam would rather be with a better looking woman. Out of the blue, she tried to kiss him. He pulled away straight away, and while everyone was shocked, Megan was furious and punched Melissa in the face. Melissa screamed and tried to protect herself but Megan didn't stop. She kept punching and kicking her, and didn't stop even after she'd knocked her to the ground. She also shoved my wife back when she tried to grab her. I would have broken them up but I was making sure my wife wasn't hurt. \n\nMelissa is severely asthmatic and began having an asthma attack when she was on the ground. Even when she was clearly struggling to breath Megan didn't stop kicking her. It was only here that Sam (who is aware of Melissa's condition) pulled her back and took her to his house to calm down.\n\nMy wife called an ambulance and Melissa was taken to hospital, where she's been for the past few days. Thankfully, they were able to bring her asthma attack under control, but she has a broken jaw and bruising everywhere. She's also told us she will press charges against her sister unless we kick her out. \n\nWhat do we do? It's doubtful any kind of peace can be arranged between the sisters, and we've been unable to convince Melissa not to do this. Either we kick Megan out or she ends up getting arrested. In theory she could go and live with Sam but obviously we'd rather our child stay with us, but even if we somehow convince Melissa not to go ahead with this, what if she attacks her sister again? \n\nAdvice needed!",

            "selftext": "When I was a new mom for the first time six years ago I felt a lot of pressure to stay home with my baby. I also really wanted to! It just felt like we belonged together and dropping her off at a daycare with people barely knew felt alien. To be honest I experienced a lot of jealousy toward people who were able to stay home with their babies.\n\nI wish I could go back in time and tell myself that it would all be okay and I was making the right decision. I can't do that so I thought I would post here in case other new parents are struggling with the choice :) Just to be totally clear I am not saying it's the right choice for every family and I think there's nothing wrong with staying home. But I literally never once heard from someone who chose to continue working (all the women in my family and in my in-laws stayed home) and felt good about the choice so I just wanted to share my reasons:\n\n1. Money! Money is the reason most people work. I made only about $30,000/year when my first baby was born, now after six years and a few transitions I am about to get a raise to $84,000.\n2. Preschool is actually pretty great! Spending a whole day with a baby was easy and fun (for me). Spending a whole day with a toddler started to become more of a chore. I noticed that in my area, even parents who stayed home started to put their kids in preschool around age 2.5-3 because the kids and parents enjoyed it so much.\n3. I feel good about the division of labor with my husband. We both contribute just about equally to cooking, cleaning, and childcare. I don't really enjoy cleaning and wouldn't like to do any more of it lol.\n4. Financial freedom. Maybe kind of a dark way to look at things but I like knowing that I stay in my marriage because I choose to, not because I can't afford to leave. To be honest we had some dark times and I wasn't sure we would make it, and I like knowing that I can take care of myself and our child without facing poverty.\n\nJust some of the bright sides to being a working mom that I wanted to share. Hope this is helpful to someone out there.",

He coaches the sports teams, makes sure to take the little out everyday, plays with them, helps with baths and bed, etc. He is reasonable and not generally controlling or overprotective. He lets the kids explore. \n\nThe one issue is the kids clothing. He doesn't let them pick out their own clothes. He sometimes will give the younger ones (5 and 2.5) some options but the outfits are already paired together and he doesn't let them swap. Our oldest is almost 11 and picks his own clothes but my husband will sometimes check to make sure he's wearing something that matches and goes together well. \n\nIt sometimes creates meltdowns when the younger ones want to wear something else but he won't let them. It's not even about being weather appropriate. I can see him not wanting them to wear jeans and a sweater outside when it's 110 degrees but this is more like him not letting them wear red shorts with a green shirt because it doesn't match. He complains about them complaining but when I suggest he let it go he says that he can't have them walking around like that. I'm tired of having to wait for my 5 year old to put on her clothes because she doesn't want to wear that or hearing my 2.5 year old yell because he can't wear his favorite shirt because it doesn't go with his pants. Even my 11 year old wants to go shopping with dad so he can help him pick out clothing for the school year. I don't know if this is a battle worth fighting but I feel like he is teaching them that they need to care about what others think and that worries me with the oldest getting closer to the teen years.

They all live in another state so they've only met my 10 month old twice and my 2 year old only a handful of times. My 10month is wary of strangers and screams bloody murder whenever one of them tries to hold him. My 2 year old has her occasional tantrums, but it doesn't happen very often and she snaps out of it after a good talking to. Anyway, they came to visit recently and declared that my children are manipulative and spoiled. They said that my 10 month old manipulates me and roll their eyes whenever I nurse him for comfort. They told me that that's exactly what he wants to do...you're letting him manipulate you. They witnessed one tantrum from my 2year old when she had been up for 13 hours with no nap and was extremely sleepy (we fought to keep her awake so she can greet her aunts when they flew in). They keep lecturing me every day (they are staying with us for two weeks) about how easily I give in to my children's demands and they keep saying that, \"if they were my kids...\" Should I just be more understanding of the fact that they don't have kids and they couldn't possibly understand what it's like to be a parent? How can I possibly explain to these people who has never had kids that you break through to a different kind of love when you become a parent, and that comforting them by nursing them is maternal instinct in action, and not an infant consciously manipulating his mother?",

It sent both of us into a panic. We both started off towards the centre so we could take her to the ER to get checked out. \nWhen my wife got there and to our daughter, she called me with what had really happened. The daycare had put a wood pallet against their little stone wall outside for the kids to climb on. Not secured, just leaned up against the wall to be used like a little ladder.  My daughter was trying to climb up it, fell backwards, crashing her head onto the concrete, then the pallet crashed onto her face, causing a huge lump on her head and a bloody nose. \nWe took her to the children\u2019s ER, and fortunately she was okay.  On the way home my daughter told me that while it hurt to have it hit her, the fact that she was trapped and couldn\u2019t get out scared her, and that bothered her more. I KNOW that dumb stupid (expletive) wasn\u2019t paying attention. She was daydreaming about whatever stupid people daydream about. I\u2019ve actually walked in to pick up my daughter and had her not even look up from whatever she was doing to say hi, or bye, whatever. Fortunately yesterday was her last day and I won\u2019t have to see her again (unrelated to this incident). \n\nSo today, the daycare tells my wife that, despite her insisting on getting rid of the wood pallets, they will keep them, but ONLY to have them laying down. They won\u2019t stand them up again. I\u2019m half way tempted to jut take my sawzall in and cut them up myself. Rant over. \n\n\n",

I see some posts on here like \"I haven't gone to the bathroom alone in seven years\" and \"my five year old stares at me 24/7\" and \"my three year old won't let me breathe.\"\n\nIt makes me start to feel like... maybe I'm a neglectful parent? I mean I meet all of my daughter's life needs, I think, she is fed, educated, loved, played with, not every minute of the day.. but she is 5 now and since mid age 3 she has spent long stretches of time, up to a couple of hours at a go without my eyes directly on her for every minute. \n\nI'd be working at my desk in the kitchen right around the corner, she would come in and show me this or that or ask for a drink or call for help wiping, but she wasn't in constant eyeshot and I didn't really even give this a second thought.\n\n I figured from observing her enough that at age three she had enough self preservation not to do anything reckless and that's been pretty accurate, the most wild thing she ever did was pull all the cushions off the couch and make a nest.\n\nAt age five, she will be in her room playing alone for hours at a go and I will only see her intermittently when she comes through to go to the bathroom or get a drink. Im doing my thing, she's doing hers, we interact in passing if we aren't doing a shared activity. \n\n\"What're you doing in there kiddo?\" \"Playing magnet tiles and making an animal zoo, what are you doing?\" \"Doing work, want X for lunch?\" \"Sure and can we do X after lunch?\" Like she's a full out person now, her own interests and plans and all.\n\nBut to see parents of 7 year olds concerned about what crisis could happen when they're taking a five minute bathroom break, it makes me take a step back. I shower with the door open for safety to hear if the shit somehow hits the fan and she starts wailing, it's never actually happened, but I also have a strict 'take a hike' policy of I will not be stared at while I shower, shave or do any other bathroom activity. My daughter also will say 'privacy' if you come around the corner and catch her in the bathroom.\n\nMaybe it boils down to different strokes for different folks but I'm just curious where most people fall on the scale here. I love this board but it makes me doubt myself sometimes. I was essentially raised by wolves so parenting in general is by the seat of my pants. I've always just aimed to treat my daughter like a respected person and expect the same in return.",

            "selftext": "TLDR at bottom\n\nThis happened today and I\u2019m very upset about it, I am a married father of two daughters with a wonderful wife who I love to pieces.\nMy wife daughters and I currently live with my in laws while our home is being built. I DO NOT get along with my father in law, but because I\u2019m not a nasty person I stay polite and generally ignore what he does and just stay cordial.\nHowever today he was playing with my 4 year old daughter who kept saying \u201cstop\u201d \u201clet me go\u201d \u201cput me down\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to play\u201d things of that nature.\nI told her that if she didn\u2019t want to play that she should say \u201cplease put me down I don\u2019t want to play\u201d she politely did because she is a sweet gentle girl.\nHis response was \u201cno we are playing\u201d this set me off. I didn\u2019t raise my voice or get angry, but I tried explaining to him that it is NOT healthy to force a little girl down and play with her, I do not want my daughter thinking that is ok because it just is not.\nHe went on to talk about making her think that way would make her a \u201cbitch\u201d and I lost it.\nMy 4 year old daughter is sweet, kind and polite, nothing near rude. I have had enough, I put up with this stuff from him all the time when he insults me because he is an overweight bully who just hates himself. However when it comes to my princess, I won\u2019t stand for it.\nHe proceeded to get upset and go on about how I was raising her wrong.\nAfter he put her down my daughter went off to a corner to cry because she thought she was in trouble for having feelings and not wanting to be held down. \nI had to explain to my 4 year old that it is NOT ok for anyone to FORCE you to do anything...I\u2019m in tears typing this because it hurts me so much knowing that this asshole thinks this is ok.\nI don\u2019t really know where to go from here because honestly I would HAPPILY pick up and leave here, but we need to save as much money as possible for our new house..\nI guess more than anything I just needed to get it out, I talked to my wife and she doesn\u2019t understand why he\u2019s so fucked up but is happy I stood up for my family. I\u2019ve always held my tongue when it came to what he says about me or my wife, because that is what she wants.\nThis just, it fucks with me...\nThanks for letting me vent.\n\nTLDR\nMy father in law thought it would be ok to hold my 4 year old daughter down and force her to play, I snapped and had to explain that it is NOT ok.",

            "selftext": "Hi all. I am 37 weeks pregnant with my first baby and seeking advice. I am also only 22, and my spouse is 26. Basically I am trying to say we are hardly seasoned veterans, and I am in a fragile state, so don't rip me to shreds please. (Not that anyone would.)\n\nMy husband and I are animal people, especially him. Over the years we have been married, we have taken in several cats. We were up to 6 (now down to 5) in our two bedroom apartment. He has a huge heart and is always wanting to take in creatures in need. The apartment itself is pretty spacious. There is a living room, dining room, kitchen, two bedrooms, and a bathroom. However, when talking about my situation on r/BabyBumps, many people were concerned about my situation. \n\nI have been struggling with the cats since early pregnancy and have been bickering about it with my husband. When others on here mentioned the potential safety risks to our child, he finally agreed it was time to rehome a few. Our plan was to rehome 3 of the more rambunctious ones to more ideal homes and keep 3 of the more bonded, codependent ones. But...I am very pregnant. It is late in the game and I don't have much energy. \n\nWe successfully rehomed one of our cats and are now down to 5. It was a wonderful situation where he already seems happier with his new owner. However, the other two, a bonded brother-sister pair, have been more difficult to rehome. In fact, my experience with rehoming them has opened me up to an ethical dilemma. \n\nTurns out (surprise, surprise) we are not the only people with animals to rehome. I joined several Facebook animal groups and have actually become disturbed at the patterns I am seeing. Multiple people every day are trying to rehome precious pets saying \"Please he needs a good home, no other options.\" Meanwhile, other people look very suspicious...selling litters I am pretty sure they are breeding from their pets. It is concerning and the more I see each day, the more concerned I feel. Also, you can bet the posts on the newborn kittens (concerning it itself) get loads of traffic while the posts on my guys gets none. I am worried I will have to surrender them to a shelter, and will thus be part of the problem.\n\nPeople have told me that I do have a good six months until the baby moves around, and that separating him from the cats and keeping our bedroom a cat-free area is a good idea. This is my plan for now because things aren't looking up for these little guys. I just feel torn, like they are my responsibility and I shouldn't give them up. I am also getting ripped to shreds on both ends...some people are saying \"How could you do this to your cats\" while others are saying \"How could you do this to your child.\" It is emotionally exhausting.\n\nSo anyway...let me know what you think. Maybe this post will be downvoted. I know posts like this are contentious. I just want what is best for my son, but I also want to do the ethical thing.\n\nThanks for any advice. \n\n\n ",

            "selftext": "I am shocked and upset and don't know what to do.\n\nI am still very good friends with my childhood best friend. We grew up together, were there through each other's relationships, when we both married the loves of our lives, when we started having children, etc. Our families are very close. She got married and had children a while before I did, so she has older children, one of which is a 21 year old college boy. I am practically his aunt and know him very well.\n\nThe past few days I could tell my daughter was in an unusual mood, but I didn't think too much of it. Today I go into her room and see her crying. I asked her what was wrong and she said she couldn't tell me and to go away. I don't know why, but I got a really bad feeling about the situation and asked to see her phone. She freaked out and started to scream at me. After a while I got it out of her that she and this 21 year old man have been in contact and talking over the course of the past year. Wtf?? My daughter was in 8th grade!! She gave me more details about the situation and said that he would encourage her to tell him her problems so they began to form a close relationship. He started telling her that he really loved her and saw her as a little sister, but told her to keep their friendship a secret from me and my best friend (his mom) and our families. Here is what I know about their relationship:\n\n* He would video call her at night after everyone was asleep and they would talk into the night\n* He would often go on rants to her about how they can't have a boyfriend girlfriend relationship now and my daughter would not really know what to say, she would just listen\n* He constantly talks to her about inappropriate things that I don't want her exposed to right now, such as his drinking habits in college and stuff like that. I don't mind her knowing about that stuff, but I would like her to be taught about that stuff in a more responsible way. \n* His friend apparently called her drunk one time and began and began say explicit, inappropriate sexual things about both her and my best friend's son (example: \"Yoo suck his d\\*\\*k already girl!\"). I want to vomit.\n* Whenever we have family gatherings, we usually let all our children hang out together and my friend's son joins them and of course we assume he's just baby sitting and watching over the younger kids. Apparently at a gathering this weekend, he had took my daughter aside and kissed her on the lips. He told her he has feelings for her but that they can't do anything right now. I am livid.\n* My daughter feels that she might have feelings for him but she is also shaken at the same time because she's uncomfortable. Deep down I know there's something telling her it's not right, hence why she's so upset. She told me she feels like she likes him but at the same time she doesn't want him to come over anymore. I feel so sick, I feel like a shit parent for letting this happen under my own roof. How could I have let this happen???\n\nThere is so much more, this is only a small portion of the stuff she's told me, but I think it pretty much sums up their relationship. I don't know what to feel right now. Part of me wants to go over to my friend's house right now and scream at her son. Obviously I'm not going to do that. But I really need some advice. I'm going to tell my husband later and I know he's going to be extremely livid. I don't know what's going to happen with me and my best friend either.

            "selftext": "Today two of the women in the community group labeled me as a \u201ctotal c**t\u201d, and let every other Stay at Home parent know not to involve me. \n\nI\u2019m a mom to 2 kids, a daughter who is 4 and a son who is 6.\n\nMy 4 year olds birthday just happened and it was parent involvement optional since we invited 6 kids. One mom said she would be dropping her son off then would come back to pick him up later, she would bring his diapers and necessities. I asked her to either stay or opt to not bring her son be he isn\u2019t potty trained and I don\u2019t thinks its fair to have to worry about constantly changing him. There is one other kid who isn\u2019t potty trained that was there but his mom stayed the whole time.\n\n\n**for those wondering the party was 5 hours long and every hour we lined up for a potty break**\n\nMy daughter was potty trained at 17 months simply because we travel a lot and she didn\u2019t like diapers. \n\nThe kids mom was extremely offended that I told her I won\u2019t be changing her 4 year olds diapers. \n\nThen there was kid number 2, my kids DO NOT use screens, my son uses the computer for his Spanish class and that\u2019s it. We allow 1 movie a week and 1 show a night usually on Hulu or Netflix since they\u2019re editied to 20 minutes. One mother was very upset with the \u201cno screens allowed\u201d policy, because she felt \u201cwhat\u2019s my son supposed to do once he doesn\u2019t want to play in the pool?\u201d I made it clear that we\u2019ll be doing games and crafts as well so he\u2019ll have plenty to do. She was thrown off and said \u201cwhy won\u2019t they be inside watching a movie? He\u2019s like that better\u201d i offered her to stay for the swimming and then leave afternoon if he\u2019s doesn\u2019t like games or crafts. \n\nBut I\u2019m not hosting a movie night. \n\nI get it, she was thinking they\u2019d be sat in front of he tv to watch something while we still around and drink wine. Well it\u2019s my kids birthday and we\u2019re gonna do fun things. \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to say if your kid isn\u2019t potty trained stay with him to do the changing. And is it that hard to be with your kid that he needs a screen 24/7? It\u2019s 5 hours if he can\u2019t survive 5 hours how will he make it in school? \n\nI\u2019m just annoyed. We\u2019re adults here not 13 year olds ",

            "selftext": "There is a debate in our house. This is the scenario that keeps repeating itself:\n\nOne parent has been offering to watch/take the baby, and then falling asleep. The baby (toddler?) can walk and run, climb steps, open and close doors. The room is \u201cbaby-safe\u201d as much as possible, but there is a coffee table and a few narrow spaces (between heavy furniture items) that the baby can get stuck. This parent is also a heavy sleeper and does not usually wake up to cries and/or screaming. The baby is curious and adventurous and has done things like bring a chair cushion over to the coffee table, try to stand on it to get a better vantage point, slip, and slam his little face into the table edge. So far, the baby has never been hurt or close to hurt when this parent has been asleep; however, the other parent has had to respond to the baby\u2019s cries multiple times when the responsible party fell asleep and the baby has been found with things he is not supposed to have (like eyeglasses) while the responsible party was asleep. This parent falls asleep while watching the baby at least once a week. This parents gets 7-8 hours of sleep every night but tends to drift off if this parent lies down. This parent has a strong habit of lying down while watching the baby.\n\nBoth parents argued, and the above parent argued that the baby is in a safe room and developmentally old enough to not require constant monitoring. The other parent agrees that the baby can be left in another room while the caretaker is, say, in the next room cooking and within earshot, but that sleeping is dangerous and negligent. This is looking to be a marriage-ending fight, so help/advice is appreciated (though it will be taken with a massive grain of salt).",

            "selftext": "I\u2019ve never been so distraught in my entire life, and I feel like an abysmal failure of a mother. What parent allows their 13 year old child to even be seriously dating, let alone having sex? How did it even happen? I\u2019ve always prided myself on staying vigilant and present in my daughters life, and have done my best to keep an open dialogue. My daughter has had several \u201cboyfriends\u201d but never anything serious or more than inviting them to family movie nights, ordering pizza and playing video games or maybe dropping them off at the mall for a few hours. I\u2019ve done my best to make sure she has the proper supervision, without being overly restrictive or helicoptering. We\u2019ve talked about sex many time and I\u2019ve been clear that it is a normal thing to do, but within the confines of a safe, healthy relationship when you\u2019re emotionally mature enough to handle all the intimate complexities and consequences that come with sharing your body with someone. I\u2019ve personally only ever been with my husband, and while I didn\u2019t expect her to wait until marriage, I did expect her not to just give it up to the first boy that asked. \n\nShe came to me a few weeks ago and told me she\u2019d had her first kiss at her schools end of year field day. I was happy she felt that she could trust me and told her I was happy for her, but I did let her know that I felt that while peck kissing was perfectly fine, anything more than that at this age is definitely inappropriate. I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m a prude, but I don\u2019t believe 13 year olds should be exploring past 1st base at this point in the emotional development. She assured me that she wasn\u2019t comfortable going any farther than kissing and that she only did it because she was the last of her friends to have their first kiss. Admittedly I should\u2019ve seen that as more of a red flag, but I remembered being 13 and know that peer pressure can be intense. I made sure to tell her that she should never do anything she\u2019s not comfortable with just because other people might be ready before her. \n\nI noticed my daughter seemed much more withdrawn and irritable lately, and I was starting to worry but also figured hey, she\u2019s 13, it\u2019s rough. I opted to give her some space and not really force her to talk to me about it just yet. I assumed her and her best friend were in a fight, since she hadn\u2019t been coming by lately. After a couple days of her locking herself in her room, not eating, and hearing her cry in the bathroom several times a day, her father and I decided to sit her down this morning and ask her what exactly was wrong. She just sat at our table in silence with a blank expression on her face, and wouldn\u2019t even look at us. I asked if she was having problems with her best friend, if we\u2019d done something that\u2019d upset her or if something was going on online that I needed to know about. Nothing. No expression, not even one worded answers. I was starting to get a very bad feeling in my gut and asked to see her phone. She *flipped her sh!t*. My daughter has never even so much as breathed wrong in her father and I\u2019s direction, with the exception of some very normal/mild preteen and teen attitude, so I was very caught off guard. She began screaming at us to leave her alone, to \u201cmind our f***ing business\u201d, that we \u201cdon\u2019t need to know sh!t\u201d and to F off. She got up from the table and tried to walk out our front door and my husband grabbed her and just tried to bear hug her until she calmed down. I\u2019d never seen her so explosive and distraught and to be honest it scared the hell out of me. I actually though she\u2019d had a nervous break down. \n\nAfter awhile, she calmed down. We took her phone, she tried to snatch it away from us one last time but I took her by the arm with me upstairs and sat her down in my bedroom. That\u2019s when the tears just came. She was absolutely inconsolable. I couldn\u2019t understand a word she was saying and she began hyperventilating. At this point I started crying too, just out of pure fear and confusion. My daughter has always been a very happy, excitable girl with bare minimum behavior issues. She\u2019s always smiling and hanging out with her friends, making everyone laugh. This was a side of my daughter I didn\u2019t recognize. \n\nThat\u2019s when she dropped the bomb on me, she\u2019s pregnant. I felt so sick I was dizzy. I didn\u2019t know what else to do so I just hugged her and cried with her. My husband found us upstairs and looked bewildered, so I pulled him into the hallway and told him. He just walked off. Just got in his truck and drove away. He\u2019s been gone since noon and keeps forwarding my calls to voicemail. I feel so scared for my daughter and overwhelmed, and I hate that he just up and left me with this all by myself. I took my daughter to our local health department this afternoon and had them do a test to be sure. She\u2019s definitely pregnant. My 13 year old child is pregnant and life doesn\u2019t even seem real anymore. She\u2019s being sent in for a dating scan next week, but from the day of her last period, she could be nearing 10 weeks along. She just started her period at the beginning of the school year, and she hasn\u2019t been regular. The girl doesn\u2019t even know how to use a tampon and she\u2019s pregnant. How could we have failed her this badly? How does this even happen? I\u2019m just..defeated? I don\u2019t even know what I am to be honest. I can\u2019t find the proper words to express this feeling. \n\nAfter some discussion, I\u2019ve discovered that the father is a 16 year old neighbor kid that I\u2019ve literally only met twice? Maybe 3 times? He does lawn care in our neighborhood during the summers and I\u2019ve had him mow our lawn once. I didn\u2019t even know they knew each other, let alone had been having sex. How did I not know? She told me that under no circumstances will she get an abortion. She told me she won\u2019t kill her baby and that if I try to make her, she\u2019ll just disappear. I would never ask her to do something like that and I certainly wouldn\u2019t force her, but she won\u2019t even hear what I have to say about adoption and she\u2019s made it clear she wants to raise this baby. Any time I\u2019ve brought up adoption or talking to someone at the pregnancy crisis center, she shuts down and stops talking to me. I asked her if she\u2019d told the father, she said that she told him on Tuesday, and that he offered to take her to the clinic for an abortion and when she said she planned on raising the baby, he blocked her number. She said she tried walking down to his house but no one would open the door. \n\nI\u2019m sick, furious, confused and so so scared. What the actual f**k do I do? What even is the next step in this situation? My daughter is barely an 8th grader and she wants to have a baby? I\u2019ve stressed over and over how unbelievably hard her life is going to be. I\u2019ve explained to her that she\u2019ll likely have no choice but to homeschool, she\u2019ll likely have a hard time finding a job and never be able to go to a university. She\u2019s going to live in poverty and be a single mother. I\u2019ve tried telling her that she deserves so much more from her life and that a baby deserves a mother who can provide for it properly, and that she have her whole life to become a mother. What 13 year old wants to have a baby?! I\u2019ve tried to explain the gravity of the situation and the seriousness that is raising a life, but I just don\u2019t think she\u2019s hearing me. We really can\u2019t afford to raise another baby but I don\u2019t know what other choice we have. \n\nI know this is long, but the last 10 hours of my life has been like a dream. I have no idea where my husband is, my barely not baby is having a baby, we can\u2019t afford another child and I don\u2019t think my marriage would survive something like this. It\u2019s been sort of cathartic to get this out there, since I don\u2019t really have anyone to tell right and and honestly, I don\u2019t think I even want to. Reddit, what do I do? Because I just want to lay down in a hole and cry right now. I really just need some direction and support right now because I\u2019m at a completely loss. \n\n",

            "selftext": "Hi all.\nMy daughter, Victoria, was feeling unwell recently. Her mum and me were concerned but didn't think it went beyond a stomach bug and nausea. She told us that she missed her period. We were obviously very worried at that point. We know that she has a boyfriend, Scott, and we stay out of what happens between them. When she told us this I rushed to get her a pregnancy test, which she took.\n\nThe result was positive and she burst into tears when she saw it. We took more tests to be certain and all came back positive. She's absolutely terrified at the moment and isn't sure whether she wants to keep the child, and we've said we'll support her whatever she does.\n\nThe one issue we have is how this will affect her schooling. She's a smart kid, as in really smart. She's top of her year in five subjects, three of which her exam marks were 100% (not a single question wrong). and hasn't got a single grade in any subject lower than a B. Her mum and me aren't pushy parents at all. Obviously we never wanted her to do badly in school, but we have never been the type to pressure her to get straight As or whatever. Everything she's done has been done of her own ability and to be honest a lot of it is natural talent. She doesn't study or revise often and has been pulled up for not doing homework and coursework, and spends more time out with her friends than at home. If she was failing at school than all of this would be concerning, but we always said that as long as her grades were at least average, we wouldn't stick our noses in, and clearly she's way above average. However, she has one year of school left, and clearly being pregnant and then caring for a baby will take up a lot of her time, and will definitely affect her post-school life. She doesn't have a solid idea of what she wants to do when she leaves school, but has said she would like to study A Levels or maybe do an apprenticeship.\n\nWe do have a reason for our parenting decisions. Her mum (who she got her brains from) was identified as a ''gifted'' child early on and was given work that was meant for much older children. She could handle it, but the attention and the pressure from her parents messed with her head, and it's something she hasn't forgiven them for (although she does love them). When we had a child of our own she was determined to let her have a ''normal'' childhood, something I agree with.\n\nVictoria has never been a ''bad'' kid. She goes to house parties on the weekends, but everyone at her school does, and neither her or her friends are involved with anyone dangerous. There was an issue last year when we found cannabis in her bedroom, but she promised is it wasn't a problem and it was just something she'd tried a few times before, and said she wouldn't do it again if we didn't want her to, and so far she hasn't as far as we're aware. As \n\nI said we would never get involved in what happens between her and her boyfriend, but we have made sure she's aware of what is appropriate and what precautions should be taken, so we're astounded she could be so careless.\n\nAs for Scott, he was obviously the first person he told, but his response was to shout at her and end the call. He then proceeded to block her number. I tried phoning him but as soon as he heard my voice he hung up. I've never particularly liked the guy but I've always been civil with him, but I'm very annoyed with his behaviour at the moment.\n\nVictoria didn't go to school the past two days and all she's done is cry. She's panicking about what she's going to tell her friends and the school, and she thinks that her life is ruined.\n\nNeed some advice about how to go about this, especially if Scott does not want to be involved, as to whether to abort or keep the child. Should we allow her to consider all options or should we try to sway her in a particular direction?",

            "selftext": "Regular Reditter here, this is a temporary/burn account.\n\nA bit of background, i grew up in a very abusive home with parents who were addicted to drugs and alcohol till i was 14, followed by foster care which equated to 47 homes and group homes till i aged out at 18. So not much personal experience with a \"healthy family environment\" to draw on. \n\nMy husband and i have been married for coming up on 3 years next week, and been together for 5.5 years. I was absolutely in love with the man for the longest time. Part of me thinks i still am, but i question it. \n\nWe have two kids together, a 3.5 yr old boy, and a 20 month old little girl. He has always had a temper, but early in our relationship It was limited to his work/boss. So it never really bothered me much. Then when we had our son he was sometimes what i thought was a bit \"snappy\" or \"too hard\" on him as a baby. But we moved back to his hometown when i was pregnant with baby #2, and he got a new job that he absolutely loved and his temper/attitude dramatically improved. \nBut somehow, slowly it has come back, and has been getting worse with time. I chalked it up to stress as baby #2 was medically fragile due to a birth defect in her heart that has since been corrected and finances were short. \nBut over the last few months i have come to realize that it's not getting better, and through much reflection have become aware that this is a pattern for him-periods of calm and peace followed by periods of irritability and overreacting. And explosive outbursts are his way of handling every thing that upsets him. \n\nIf it was just me, then i might be able to handle it. But the way he handles our kids makes me uncomfortable.\nMost Concerning is he has a sort of Jekyl vs Hyde personality towards them. He will over react by yelling at the kids over little things, calling them stupid, swearing, threatening them with physical discipline. Then storms out for a a smoke. Ten minutes later he is tickling them or teasing them or gushing over something they just did-line a block tower they built or a coloring or completing a wooden puzzle. \nAnd i feel like his discipline is too harsh. He blows up at them, and often has a spank first explain later motto. \n\nFor example, both kids know they aren't supposed to dump food-i.e. bowl of dry cereal, plate of crackers, container of fries, etc\nOur son has a habit of doing just that. Idk Why. It's a repetive battle with the kids. I've gotten used to it. He's is getting better, but he does it probably once a week still. I just make him clean it up and explain that if he does it again I'll take his snack away. Which is perfectly effective. \n\nHubby however Will walk in,see cereal all over the floor, and proceed to yell \"Dammit Matt I Fucking told you not to do that! Why do you do that shit!? Why?\" Followed by standing him up and spanking him three or four times hard on his but, all while still yelling and swearing at him. He then will storm out of the room. \nAfterwards he is either crabby and short with him the rest of the night or he acts like nothing has happened. I never know what to expect. \n\nHe is a little less harsh on the 20 month old, but he still yells at her, cusses her out, says she is being a little b!tch when she is fussy and fighting sleep or being mean to her brother, and spanks her frequently as well. \n\nHe has only ever used an open hand on baby girl, with the exception of occasionally a new diaper or something, but there has been three time where he used a plastic kitchen spoon to swat or son.\n\nHe will flick them in the mouth for biting-usually enough to make their lip bleed or give a fat lip, or bites them back. Not enough to bruise or bleed, but enough to leave a mark for several minutes or more. \n\nAnd when he spanks the kids, if they do not have a diaper/pull-up on but are in underwear instead or of they move/he misaims and gets their back or leg, it leaves marks. Anything from a red mark lasting a couple hours, to light bruising that lasts up to a couple of days. \n\nHis temper in general is bad too. Not just with the kids. Like, of he is playing on his tablet and the connection is slow, the game is lagging,isn't going how he wars he starts swearing and slamming his tablet down in his lap, occasionally chucking it across the room and storming out. \nOr if he spills something he swears and slams things down and then basically throws an adult twofer tantrum while cleaning it up.\n\nAnd everything is someone else's fault. \n       Missed his shot on his golf game on the tablet? The kids were being too loud and distracting, they bumped his chair, the dog was in his way etc.\n      Tripped over a toy-my fault or the kids fault for leaving it in the way. \n       Stubbed his toe, table is a P.O.S. and we should have told him it was there, or moved it to a better spot.\n      Dog pooped on the floor bc i was busy with dinner and he ignored him-damn dog is trying to piss him off, needs to learn to ask to go out properly, i should have stopped cooking to take him out, he needs to learn how to Fucking wait.\n      Didn't pass his CDL Trainer Certification test- the tester was a selfish prick with an attitude problem and doesn't know how to score a Damn quiz and mashes shit up and picks whoever he likes best to pass. \n        Not getting enough hours at work-Scheduler is a bossy stupid birch whodoesn't know how to divide shifts equally and should give preference to those with seniority or the most need, not whoever asks firsts or whoever she is duck buddies with.\n\nYou get my drift. \n\nI am concerned cause\n1. I don't like his behavior. I grew up with that crap, hated it, don't intend to live with again. And sure as hell don't want our kids growing up with it.\n2. Our kids are staying to copy him. Becoming v defiant, fighting and shooting constantly, throwing things or punching prone when they are upset or something isn't working. And i didn't want them v thinning that is how people should act or is acceptable behavior.\n3. The 3.5 yr old is starting to show signs of being afraid of him on occasions.\n4. When i bring my concerns up with him, he thinks i am over sensitive. He says that how he reacts(yelling,throwing things,slamming things, punching things) is how \"real\" men handle things. That men have to act out physically and verbally to \"blow off steam\". And that he would never hurt the kids-yet also says he wants it to hurt when he spanks them so that they know they are in trouble and it \"gets the point across\". And that I'm not hard enough on them. That is we don't \"whoop their ass\" they will walk all over us. \n5. He constantly says \"beating their ass when they do something stupid or f@@k up isn't gonna hurt them. It's called learning respect. My dad whooped my ass all the time, and i turned out fine.\"\n\nHe has always and is still refusing any kind of counseling or therapy cause he thinks they are \"full of shit\" and \"destroy marriages for money\"\nAnd will not accept any kind of parenting classes. I have talked to him several times, tried different ideas and suggestions. Nothing. The only change he is willing to mane is to \"try to watch his mouth\" arounds the kids by trying not to swear so much. But i really haven't seen hardly any improvement. \nHis family agrees he needs help and that he is too harsh and has an anger problem, but they have fought this with him with no success fur so long they give up. They won't help other than confirming my thoughts that he needs help. They won't even bring it up to him anymore cause he just freaks out on them. \n\nI seriously don't know what to do. I'm a stay at home mom, with no work history what do ever. I get a measly $250 ssi each month. He is the breadwinner. And most of my family/support network is on the other side of the state or out of state. Except my sister. She's the only one remotely local. \n\nI love him very, very much. And i did make a commitment to love him eternally when i said i do, but i can't keep dealing with this. In many ways he is still my best friend, a good confidante, loves and adores his kids and brags about them, and brags over backward to provide for us. \nBut our kids, they dont deserve his temper and aggression. I don't want them to enter into the cycle of violence and aggression and negativity i grew up with. I just, i can't let that happen. I can't let that cycle continue. I risked my life to end that cycle, and i will be damned if I'm gonna go through it again or let my kids go through it.c\n\nI just need advice as to what to do. Is this a losing battle? Am i trying to climb a mountain that's just gonna crumble before i reach the summit? Am i over racing to his behavior? I just don't know. Really need some neutral third party perspective here. \n\nThanks guys. ",

            "selftext": "Not on my kid, on my husband. Holy shit. He recently got diagnosed with ADHD (fucking finally, he\u2019s 35 and always knew sth wasn\u2019t right and now we finally know) and is being medicated now. And it\u2019s absolutely amazing. He\u2019s *awake*. He notices me, our son, like, there\u2019s no more fog. I don\u2019t know how to describe it, he was always kinda quiet bordering on \u201cI don\u2019t give a fuck\u201d and now it\u2019s totally the opposite. And our son obviously loves it too. Before, he was such a mamas boy because my husband wasn\u2019t super responsive to him and it was always huge drama when dad had to do something or go somewhere with him/say goodbye to me - and now it\u2019s no biggie! He just says ok and happily goes with dad. I don\u2019t know with who else to share this but it makes me so so happy and relieved. I was starting to doubt, ya know? \nAnyways. I\u2019m really happy about this! The downside is that ADHD is thought to be inheritable (I have it too, also medicated) so our son might have it too; but I\u2019m thinking, we both know the symptoms and how to deal with it so our kid is gonna be fine.

            "selftext": "So today was finally the last day of my daughter's preschool. \n\nOut of 22 students in the class, apparently we are the only ones not willing to spend money on an end of the year gift for the teacher. Granted we live in a high income area but we are not of the high income variety, but we were made to feel like total cheap bastards and I have to vent it out.\n\nLast Friday the mass text message arrived. \"Hi everyone, I'm sure you're all in agreement that we should be presenting Mrs Teacher and Mrs Assistant with a gift for the end of school. I've taken it upon myself to collect money from each parent towards it, I'm figuring to get them Amazon gift cards and figure if each parent gives $20 towards each teacher ($40 total) I can make up the different to a nice round number and we would be in good shape. I'll collect on Monday, thanks\"\n\nI saw this and then saw the many replies rolling in. Ranging from sure, to I'll give you a full $50, to a few I already got a giftcard for them for restaurants/massages, but I'll give you X anyway. I'll see your $40 and raise you $60, let me add on some floral arrangements too. \n\nI really mulled it over. But we are living extremely tight and spending that sudden $40 would mean sacrificing in another area of our own lives. I'm grateful to the teacher and all but she isn't doing volunteer work, she's getting a paycheck at the end of the day. That's more than I spent on gifts for my own husband for Father's Day, I got him $10 worth of special candy! It seemed we were the only holdouts.\n\nCome Monday, the money collector was at the pickup line with a clipboard in hand with each child's name written down and I guess what was promised. She headed down the drop off line as we waited for the teacher to unlock the door and got to me, \"haven't heard from you.. did you not see my text?\" \n\nI replied yes I saw it, but we are handling our own thank you privately. Cue the blank stare. \"Other people are doing their own thing too but still contributing to this group gift.\"\n\nI replied, understood, but I'm fine with just doing our own thing, sorry. \"Well you won't get to sign the group card then.\" Sniff, huff, down the line to the next sucker who has her $50 out in the breeze already, saying \"i didn't have anything smaller so just take the extra.\"\n\nSo for the next couple days, the snubbing is obvious and palpable. Suddenly we no longer are included in the after school playground text which came every single good weather day beforehand so the kids could get together and play. My child was no longer being told hello by the adults in the morning. Backs are turned to me when normally we would small talk before the doors opened and the energy is just clear disdain.\n\nAnd then their 'gift presentation' took place on Thursday, though school wasn't over until Friday and it couldn't help but feel... intentionally rotten. Captain money mom there made sure she was at the door first and as soon as it opened said, \"MOST of the kids have put together a gift for you, so if we could just have a moment and those children be pulled aside, you can just release the other ones not on this list...\" \n\nCue my daughter being the sole child to be shuttled out the door, as two of the other moms move forward grinning with floral baskets the size of car seats and captain mom pulls cards out of her bag. Thankfully my child was unaware of the weirdness of it all and we just went on our way. \n\nSo today was the last day. I had my daughter do what I felt was appropriate, make 'thank you, happy summer' cards herself and pick bouquets from our own garden. She carried them up to the door and her teacher seemed delighted and not at all put out that it was not $400+ to Amazon. I didn't feel the need to explain myself to the mom squad, and simply said nothing to them and silently left and enjoyed deleting and blocking all of the numbers from the text groups.\n\n Thank god next year my daughter will be going to a public school that is more on par with our financial level. But all said, I'm glad I didn't fall sucker for the pressure. $40 or more to these ladies is obviously not even a thought, but for us who budget right down to the last roll of toilet paper, it would've meant no recreation money for my daughter's first month of summer vacation in order to keep up with the joneses. Just felt the need to share because it's been racing through my mind all day, I had to get this out.",

The sitter told me my daughter and the dog were just playing and, before she knew it, the dog snapped and bit her cheek. \n\nMy daughter generally isn\u2019t rough with animals, but, again, I wasn\u2019t there to know. \n\nShe required several stitches but she\u2019s okay. I tried not to be hysterical for her sake, as she was really shaken up by the whole thing. I\u2019m worried she may scar, but more than anything I\u2019m grateful that she wasn\u2019t more severely hurt. \n\nThe dog is currently at my sister\u2019s apartment, but that is not a sustainable situation. The landlord there doesn\u2019t even allow pets, so she\u2019s hiding him. She is willing to keep him for a few more days, but I don\u2019t want her to get in trouble, so I need to figure something out quickly. \n\nI don\u2019t know if the dog will be euthanized if I choose not to keep him. He\u2019s 11 years old, and I don\u2019t think he would be readily adopted. \n\nThe worst part is that my husband is currently out of the country for work. I\u2019m afraid to call and tell him what happened because I know he will want me to get rid of the dog. (He\u2019s not really a dog person anyway, but he\u2019s tolerated him for my benefit). \n\nThe other option, I guess, would be to keep the dog and monitor him closely. I\u2019ve researched dog trainers, but I don\u2019t know how much training would be beneficial. The dog has been trained since puppyhood and well-behaved. Could a trainer help to fix this if it was an isolated incident?\n\nI\u2019m feeling very lost right now.

We have also told family to please ask permission before posting. Our family, while mostly respecting our wishes to keep our baby off social media, thinks we're being overprotective and crazy.  My MIL posted a picture of our daughter recently, and we asked her to take it down.\u00a0 My mom has even gone so far as to say that my daughter will think we don't love her because we didn't post about her on social media when she was younger \\[insert dramatic eye roll here\\].\u00a0\n\nWe've explained the multiple reasons why we have made this choice, but they are still having a hard time with it.\u00a0\n\nHere are our reasons:\u00a0\n\n\\-Her privacy and safety are of the utmost importance. I don't know what my family members' privacy settings are or who they are friends with on social media. There's a lot of creeps out there, and the internet makes it easier for them to be creepy.\u00a0\n\n\\-She should have the right to choose what is posted about her when she is old enough to decide whether she wants to have an online presence or not.\u00a0This is the first generation that has no say in their online presence, and we want to respect her future choice to be online or not. \n\n\\-We don't want her to feel embarrassed or be ridiculed for something that was posted about her online, as what is posted on the internet is there forever.\u00a0\n\n\\-We don't want her to be subjected to judgment from our followers or whomever else can view her pictures. We also don't want her to grow up feeling that she is only as valuable as the number of \"likes\" she gets on a picture or post.\u00a0\n\nBesides, who benefits from posting these pictures online? Does it actually benefit the child? In most cases, I feel like it doesn't. \n\n**So... are you keeping your babies off social media? Or are we totally alone in this endeavor?**\u00a0\n\n(I'd like to add that I am not judging those who do decide to post pictures of their children. I guess I'm just looking for a little reassurance here. I think that as parents, we all try our best to do what we think is right for our children.\u00a0)",

I give them to myself, my son and my wife (because she\u2019s terrified and I\u2019m good at what I do). There\u2019s clearly something in our primate brains that has an aversion to having our skin pierced. \n\nBut fellow parents, PLEASE STOP USING INJECTIONS AS DISCIPLINE! Almost every time a parent brings in a child for any kind of vaccination or other needed injection I hear the parent say something to the effect of,\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not good/don\u2019t behave them I\u2019m going to have them give you TWO shots instead of one!\u201d - this occurs no matter the number of shots. If the kid needs 3, they make it 4....etc\n\n\n\n3 requests/rules: \n\n1. I am not the deliverer of your discipline. I will not in any way discipline your child. That is your child, your responsibility. If they are not behaving how you\u2019d like them to, then correct the behavior without involving me at all. This is not a guillotine in my hand and I\u2019m not an executioner. \n\n2. There is NO circumstance under which I would ever give your child an additional, UNNEEDED injection. Ever. I would lose my license, my job and my career. You are lying to your child. If you were too ignorant to know that I would never do that up to this point, now you know. \n\n3. Do NOT tell them that they won\u2019t ever need any more shots. At some point they most likely will. Will it be the same as the one they\u2019re getting now? Could be. Could be WORSE than the injection they\u2019re getting now or even BETTER. This, again, makes you a liar and your word empty. I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t need to explain why this is a bad idea as a parent. \n\n\nThat\u2019s it. Just be honest with your child and relate to them that shots can hurt a bit but that they\u2019re for their protection, not a punishment. \n\n\n\nThanks for listening,\n\nA Nurse who wants to help your child be as safe as possible.

This friend lives across town and goes to a different school, dance studio, etc, so I have to work with the other mom to arrange play dates. She and I are both professionals, similar socioeconomic background, political leanings, level of education, etc. I have 2 science degrees, she has 2 education degrees.  You would think that whatever minor things we disagree on would be so insignificant they wouldn\u2019t matter at all, right?\n\n\n\n\nWell, since I\u2019ve known her, she has been a member of the anti-science wing of motherhood. For example, she talks frequently about how her daughter can not tolerate sugar. No problem, I take care of plenty of diabetic kids and adults, I\u2019m all over sugar intake. Except this girl eats sweetened instant oatmeal for breakfast every morning with a glass of juice...the diet rules seemed rather arbitrary, so I asked her mother for clarification when she comes over and the mother opted to just send food with her (most sweetened with sugar or things like dried fruit). \n\n\n\nAlso, she doesn\u2019t believe in calories or cellular respiration. This weekend she explained that just within the last month, the link between vaccines and autism was found. \n\n\n\nMy strategy has been to avoid science subjects with her and not respond when she goes there. She seems to be doing so with increasing frequency.  Meanwhile, all of the other moms have rejected modern medicine and use essential oils. Their kids are gluten free and dairy free without any sort of medical need. \n\n\n\nIt is just so discouraging that anti science beliefs are so pervasive, particularly among mothers. ",

            "selftext": "Wife and I are early 30s and parents of our first child, a 6 month old girl. Wife is a SAHM; and I am working outside the home. \n\nThe moment I get home, my wife is throwing the baby at me and basically telling me \u201cshe is your problem now\u201d until it is bed time for us (about 11pm) and even though our daughter is going down much earlier than that, my wife expects me to do a lot of chores so I don\u2019t actually get any moment to just relax for even an hour. In theory, we take turns getting up during the night, which is tiring with work the next day, but only fair - except I feel like I get up 3 times for every time she gets up. She says \"I deal with this all day, your turn\", as if I didn't \"deal with it\" from the moment I got home and she went into our room and watched Netflix on her laptop.\n\n She also expects me to have our daughter a full day during the weekend while she goes off and does whatever she wants. I don\u2019t get a day to do and do whatever I want. \n\nShe seems to think work is my \u201cbreak\u201d and I am actually quite resentful of that line of thinking. \nMaybe I don\u2019t have to change a diaper or listen to a baby cry while I\u2019m at work, but it still isn\u2019t a break. I have a very stressful job (I am a lawyer) that I don\u2019t exactly enjoy (stuck in it until the law school student loans are paid off), it\u2019s not like I am off at a caf\u00e9 reading in silence for 9 hours, or checking into a hotel and having a nice long sleep and a shower. She has also told me she usually naps when our daughter naps, meaning she gets about 2-3 hours sleep during the day. I can\u2019t exactly just have a 2 or 3 hour nap at work. \n\nI feel like being a SAHM is her day job the same way being a lawyer is my day job. Perhaps that job is more unpleasant than a corporate job, but it is the job she is choosing to do at this point. Her paid maternity leave is finished meaning she could go back to work if she wanted. We might not end up financially ahead because of childcare costs, but if is an option if she is \u201cover\u201d being with the baby, which she has said before she is. If she is that over being a SAHM, she can go back to work. As an adult and an equal partner in our relationship, I think she has a responsibility to work \u2013 whether that be as a SAHM providing childcare, or working outside the home. \n\nI think things are unfair right now - she does her \u201cjob\u201d, chills for a few hours, sleeps. I do my job, childcare, sleep. \n\nI feel like she is getting six or so hours \u201coff\u201d from her job, and time to herself on the weekend, while I don\u2019t do anything but work, take care of out daughter, do household chores, and sleep.\n \nI am sure quite a lot of people are going to roast me for this, but I am honestly on the edge of burning out. \n\nI want to talk to her about this and make it clear that while it is correct to share childcare duties, we should be both given somewhat equal time to have a break. I am happy to give her a break from her job of looking after the baby all day, but I think it is only fair I also get a \u201cbreak\u201d after coming home from my job. I think we should both get a couple of hours in that time to do what we want. I am happy for her to have some time to herself on the weekend, but I think I should be afforded the same. \n\nHow can I approach this with her without sounding like an asshole? Because I am very close to burning out, and I also feel like she doesn\u2019t seem to respect the fact that my job, which is well paying and provides for the family, is not actually a BREAK, and that I need a break too, the same way she needs a break from childcare.  \n\n",

            "selftext": "I have 5 year old twin girls and while I do love them, I absolutely hate what parenthood has done to my life and loathe the job of mothering. I thought it would get better as they gold older, but it hasn't. I quite simply regret my decision to become a mother and found more significantly fulfillment, joy, and happiness in my pre\\-children life. I love my daughters but wish I could be their aunt or godmother instead \\- I love them find the never ending responsibility of motherhood to be emotionally suffocating and sacrifices I thought I would be OK with making before they were born are soul crushing to live out on a daily basis. I feel like the lovely moments that do exist simply don't make up for everything that goes on in between. To many people that makes me an asshole but I honestly thought I would enjoy this a lot more than I did and I feel bad that I don't love it the way so many people do. But please be assured that I suck it up for the sake of my daughters. It doesn't matter if I regret it, they are here now so I have to deal with this. \n\nI feel like expressing these feelings is always assumed to be PPD and that therapy is suggests as a means of curing these feelings. It is annoying to see feelings or regret dismissed as curable PPD. Some people just chose wrong. Some people just hate this lifestyle \n\nI have seen multiple therapists and they have all come to the same conclusion \\- I don't have PPD. I am just someone who regrets a major life decision and has to live with it every day despite her regrets. Not everyone who regrets their decision has PPD, and therapy is not a magical solution. I could see 100 of the words best therapists and none of them will make me love being a mother or feel like I made the right decision. They can help me learn to accept my life, but they can't change the fact I have regrets and that I'd take it back in a heartbeat if I could. \n\nDon't get me wrong \\- therapy has been helpful to me. It helped me become more at peace with my decision to have children. Before getting therapy, I was extremely self loathing as a result of my regrets and was very bitter and I did need help dealing with this. But while I am now in a healthier headspace, I still regret it and am unlikely to stop feeling this way. ",

The newborn days sent me into one of the worst flares I've ever had. She's six months now and I'm still struggling every day with it. I love her to death, but there's no denying that my condition is not compatible with multiple children. And I'm heartbroken over it.\n\nBut that doesn't stop the constant barrage of hate, both online and in person. People saying its lazy, selfish, heartless, cruel, unfair to my daughter. People claiming we're making a mistake, how we need to have another soon to give her a life long friend. Nevermind the fact that we lost four pregnancies before her. Or that I am just not physically able to go through another pregnancy. Or that I don't want my children to spend their childhood taking care of their mother. I'm expected to have more children, even if it costs them in quality of life.\n\n\nAnd you know what? Even if I were perfectly healthy, if I decided I only wanted to have one child, I still shouldn't be receiving hate. I shouldn't be called names or be discredited as a mother. I am no less of a mother, woman, or human for having one child, three children, or eight. Motherhood is such a deeply personal journey that is not a one size fits all situation. I'm so tired of this bs mommy shaming culture that we have going on. Why can't we all agree that parenthood is a hell of a ride and leave it at that? There's too much to actually worry about in this crazy world. ",

            "selftext": "My Bub (well, toddler - 19 months) is still being breastfed. Please no judgement. But she\u2019s not fully breastfed. She\u2019s on solid meals with snacks. But sometimes during the day, I\u2019ll nurse her for a little bit - more so for the bonding than anything. She\u2019s basically weaned and I can stop cold turkey if I wanted and it wouldn\u2019t affect her. Like I said, I continue because it\u2019s the mother-bub bond. And I did (and still do) have a hard time bonding with her for other reasons. \nAnyways the problem is both hubby and mother in law have stated to me that I should look at weaning her since I\u2019m returning to work in September. However I have repeatedly told them that weaning isn\u2019t a problem and my returning to work won\u2019t affect it. She\u2019ll be off the boob by the time she\u2019s 3 at the very latest. \nAm I in the wrong? Am actually too naive to realise that maybe I really should stop right now?\n\nAdditional:\nThe other reason for my having a hard time to bond with her from the very beginning is because all I ever heard was people gushing over Hubby and how much she looks like him. So I\u2019m just the one that gave birth and was forgotten about. It\u2019s up to me to appreciate me and remind me I\u2019m a good mother aha ",

            "selftext": "Hello. I\u2019ve come here to seek information, or maybe to just vent and rant. At this point, I don\u2019t really know. But anyways, here goes. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I have a 3 year old. She insisted on bed sharing since day one. At first I was on-board with the idea because she was breast feeding and bed sharing seemed the best option for all of us to get sleep at night. This worked out for the first 1.5 years, but now, our daughter is 3, and bed sharing, I started to realize about a year ago, was a terrible idea. My fianc\u00e9 loves it however, and it has become a problem. \n\nI woke up this morning from yet another rough night of sleep. Another night of our daughter twisting and turning between us. She\u2019s like a clock that skips, flips and turns. One hour her feet are facing the foot of the bed, and the next hour her feet are smashing into my eye socket. This goes on all night long. She also sucks at sleeping. She tends to wake up every 30-40 minutes crying for the first 3-4 hours of each and every night. Here\u2019s an example; we tend to put her down between 7/8pm. From 7/8 to 11 or 12am she will wake up every 30-40 minutes crying. After midnight however, she\u2019s generally a sound sleeper. This is little consolation because we need to be up by 4am for work. \n\nI\u2019ve tried to get her in her own bed. Last year I bought her her own twin toddler bed, complete with her favorite characters to decorate it with. She loved it. My fianc\u00e9 however, was content on continuing bed sharing. Saying how traditional families did this for millenniums and yada yada yada. I explained to her how I\u2019m not sleeping. I\u2019m waking up with black eyes from our daughter kicking and hitting me throughout the night. She keeps saying we will work on sleep training soon. Soon never happens. \n\nI\u2019ve noticed that my immune system is breaking down from sleep deprivation. For the last 2 years I\u2019ve been getting around 4-5 broken hours of sleep and as a result, I cannot concentrate at work, I\u2019m tired mostly every day (more like chronic exhaustion)and I\u2019ve been getting sick fairly often. We get a break once or twice a month when our daughter stays over at my moms for the weekend.\n\n\nI feel though, that my fianc\u00e9 is the problem by not wanting to help me get our daughter in her own bed. The last time I insisted on her sleeping in her own bed, we moved it in our bedroom and my fianc\u00e9 and daughter slept on it pretty much every night. \n\nI don\u2019t know how else I can convey to my fianc\u00e9 the NEED to get our daughter to sleep in her own bed. The lack of sleep is killing me! I feel like I can\u2019t do this on my own and that both parents need to be on board. ",

            "selftext": "This may be outside the scope of this particular sub, so if anyone has an idea of a better place to post, let me know.\n\nSome context: I\u2019m white, my husband is white, and my 9mo daughter is white. My nickname for her is monkey because she\u2019s so active, giggly and into everyone and everything. Also I vaguely remember my dad calling me monkey when I was little, so I guess I passed it down.\n\nThe situation: Yesterday we\u2019re at the park (we live in a very diverse neighbourhood in Toronto, a very diverse city) and I\u2019m pushing my daughter on the baby swings. She\u2019s laughing and I\u2019m talking to her, saying things like \u201cDoes monkey want to go higher?\u201d \u201cIs monkey having fun?\u201d Etc. A black woman approaches me and looks absolutely stunned. At first I thought something horrible must have happened because she looked completely taken a back, so I asked her if she was okay.\n\nIn summary she explained she was surprised someone would use that term because of its racist history and that she was deeply offended hearing it, she expected more from this community, and that I must be insensitive to teach my daughter that sort of language was okay. \n\n(And just because I expect some people will comment asking if perhaps she thought I was calling her daughter a monkey, I don\u2019t think so. She popped up out of nowhere; I hadn\u2019t seen either her or her kid before she approached me, so it wasn\u2019t like I was chatting with her daughter. But who knows.)\n\nI was so shocked that all I could do was apologize and then I just picked up my daughter and left. I cried when I got home, I think from a combination of the surprise of it all (you don\u2019t exactly plan to be called a racist on a leisurely trip to the park), the idea that what I considered a pretty innocent nickname could be offensive to someone, and if I\u2019m being totally honest, indignation at the accusation at all.\n\nI admit I\u2019ve never really interrogated my usage of this term in relation to my daughter. I\u2019m not totally naive - I know there\u2019s an ugly history of racist comparisons of monkeys with black people, and because of this I\u2019d never use this term on any of my daughter\u2019s black playmates, but I\u2019ve never seen any issue in calling my daughter, who\u2019s so white she\u2019s borderline transparent, this. I\u2019m completely aware it\u2019s the epitome of white privilege to leave such things unexamined, which is why I\u2019m here hoping for some additional perspectives.\n\nMy husband thinks I encountered an overly sensitive person who blew it out of proportion and that monkey is totally innocent in this context, but I can\u2019t shake the notion that I\u2019m inadvertently perpetuating hurtful language. I don\u2019t want to offend anyone and I don\u2019t want to wrap my daughter up in blind white privilege any more than she has inherently by being white.\n\nIs this racist? And yes, I know that if you have to ask, it\u2019s probably racist. \n\nAlso, let\u2019s all be nice to each other in the comments, k?",

            "selftext": "Let me first say that I love my wife so much and I know that many SAHMs work very hard and I agree that motherhood is one of the most under-appreciated and hardest jobs in the world. That said, my wife's choice to be a SAHM is hurting our marriage. My wife is 36F and I am 37M and we have one child (4M). I always knew that my wife wanted to be a SAHM and we discussed it at length before we even tried conceiving our child. We agreed that I would work outside of the home (as an attorney) to provide financial security for our family and she would stay home with our children. We agreed that her responsibilities would be cooking, house cleaning, laundry, and errands. Two weeks after the positive pregnancy test, my wife put in her 2 weeks notice at her teaching job and stayed home throughout her pregnancy to ensure maximum rest and relaxation so that she could have the healthiest pregnancy possible. Once our son was born, we agreed that she needed to have days off to take time for herself, so we hired a part time college student to babysit for us two days a week so that my wife could have lunch with her friends, go to the spa, and do other things to pamper herself (we set aside $500/week for her to use as she chooses for entertainment and pampering expenses.) But slowly, she added on more and more days with the babysitter until the babysitter started coming 5 days a week. She also increased our housekeepers from one day a week to twice a week (one day for cleaning the house and the other day for doing all of the laundry.) She added a weekly yard service, dog walker, and grocery delivery. As it turned out she didn't enjoy cooking very much and I didn't want to force her to do something she doesn't enjoy doing, we now order takeout almost every night of the week. Eventually paying the babysitter $20/hr for 40 hrs/week became too costly, so we put our son in a Tuesday/Thursday preschool program so that we could decrease the babysitter's hours to only 3 days a week (M/W/F). My wife needs childcare each morning of the week because she works out daily with her personal trainer, but she doesn't necessarily need it in the afternoons (our son's preschool program ends at 2pm.) However the babysitter always stays until 6 or 7 pm until I get home and can help my wife take care of our child. When I come home (and I often work 10-12 hours a day) there is always a sink full to the brim with dirty dishes (that aren't cleaned until the next time the housekeepers come), toys all over the house, and my wife passes our son off to me because she needs a break from the long day she's had. She constantly gets mad that I am not able to put our son to bed most nights because of client meetings that run long. Recently my wife has gotten very angry and says that she never does anything for herself and that I need to provide her with more spending money so that she can increase her massage and acupuncture appointments to at least weekly. We are already paying for preschool, a regular babysitter, my wife's personal trainer, nightly take out, my wife's clothing budget (she gets $200/week for clothes), and new toys (my wife is very good at rotating our son's toys so that he has new toys to play with every month, so I do commend her on that.) I work really hard and come home and try my best to be an active father and husband, but I find that I am lacking compassion when my wife complains that she never does anything for herself. Our original plan was that she would stay home with our son and also take care of the housework and errands, but now the reality is that my son is cared for by other people full time and all of the household chores have been outsourced. I can't ask my wife what she does all day because that is disrespectful, but I am beginning to get very frustrated that I am funding her vacation lifestyle and I feel like she is taking advantage of being a SAHM. I know that I should probably just bite my tongue because there isn't anything that I can do, but I am feeling very defeated. ",

Our 8 year old is the oldest of 3 (technically 4 because I\u2019m pregnant again) and so far he\u2019s the only boy. \n\nHe\u2019ll do things like have Jayden help him cook, have Jayden help him work on his motorcycle or truck, and just this morning he had. Jayden help him get started on the garden (we just moved into a new house in a new state a few days ago).\n\nSo I listened to them talk together while I was feeding the toddlers. \n\nAnd while I can\u2019t directly quote everything he said I can hit a few highlights.\n\nHe told Jayden that he needs to start thinking a lot about growing into a young man. He told him that over the next few years of his life he\u2019s going to have many people trying to tell him what a \u201cman\u201d is but most of them will be wrong.\n\nHe said being a man starts with being a generally good person. Be honest, be kind, be helpful, be diligent, be responsible, be empathetic. But after you\u2019ve got those things down, being a \u201cman\u201d is more of an art than a science. \n\nHe listed a few things people will sometimes think are too effeminate for men. Like ballet, gymnastics, dance...he went on with examples like that.\n\nJayden then said that he liked the stuff he\u2019s done with his dad. The car stuff, the motorcycle stuff, the landscaping stuff etc.\n\nAnd my husband told him that all of that is totally fine, but to always know that he\u2019s choosing to be that specific kind of a man and he should never look down on anyone who chooses another path. \n\nHe specifically said \u201cIt is okay to be macho. It is okay to be soft spoken. It is okay to be artsy. But no matter what you do, be *good enough* at it.\u201d\n\nJayden: \u201cHow good is good enough.\u201d\n\nHusband: \u201cIf you can\u2019t teach it to someone else, you\u2019re not good enough yet.\u201d\n\nI just thought this was a very interesting conversation. I feel very happy that my husband is teaching our son a healthy masculinity.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? What have you taught/do you teach your boys about masculinity?",

            "selftext": "So my wife had a bunch of her family over my house for a BBQ. My sister-in-law has three pretty wild boys (ages 10, 8, 5) but for the most part their chaos is pretty self contained. We're about 5 hours into the BBQ and it starts to rain. Their three boys and mine (ages 9 and 5) are all playing pretty nicely together on the xbox with just 3 controllers. To keep the peace, I let them know that the winner of each round on their game gets to keep playing and the other two need to trade with the others. They all equally suck at the game so turnover is pretty fair. The middle one decided at some point he didn't want to give up his controller after a random round. His dad tried handling it, and the kid throws the controller at the floor. I picked up the controller and calmly said he was done with the xbox and no one made a big deal out of it. \n\nFive or so minutes goes by, the middle one comes back out starts hitting his older brother, his parents send him to the other room. Next he broke one of his younger brothers toys in half, and his mom put him in the other room to cool down again. He came back after a few minutes and took the controller out of my son's hands and threw it down. His mom tells her husband he's going to only get worse if we don't give him a turn. The kid is kicking the back of the couch ignoring his parents when I had enough. I didn't yell at the kid, but I turned around and told him sternly:\n\nStand up *the kid immediately jumps to his feet*\nDo not kick my couch, do you understand? *he said yes*\nThis isn't your parents house, this is my house, and I make the rules. You have a terrible attitude, so you're not getting another turn. Do you understand? *he said yes*\n\nThe couple with the boys ended up leaving shortly after. I asked the other adults if I was being an asshole. My wife's only critique was my command voice (I'm retired Army) probably gave the kid an anxiety attack; the other adults said it's my house. I'm not trying to change anyone's parenting style; but I think it's flat out disrespectful for a kid to act that way, and just as disrespectful for their parent to passively hope their child stops. This kid gets pretty destructive when he's having a tantrum, and I know that they're not looking to repair a hole kicked into our couch or replace our TV when he throws a controller at it. I could have talked with his parents (who were right there in the room seeing everything happen), but I'm fairly positive that would have been far more embarrassing for them to not be able to control the situation than for me to put an end to the situation right then and there. I would have no issue with another adult doing the same if the roles were reversed - e.g. not being verbally abusive, swearing, physical contact.\n\nSo I ask all of you to get an honest answer, did I handle that like an asshole?",

My daughter was late to the airport (she's never been the most punctual) and was finishing up her packing in a hurry. I heard her asking her sister if she had any condoms. Big sister said no, and so I got some and gave them to her. She just responded with a sheepish laugh.\n\nMy ex MIL was at the house to see my daughter off. Even when I was married to her son, we didn't have the best relationship. At times, my ex would act like he was 15 again, consistently submitting to her will. Anyway, ex MIL saw me giving condoms to my daughter and she wasn't happy. Promptly called my ex later that day. \n\nHe in turn called me and went on a rant. He said I'm encouraging \"promiscuity and debauchery\" in our daughter. I asked whether he would prefer our daughter have unprotected sex, and he said she shouldn't be sexually active until she is married. I told him he was being ridiculous - she's a grown ass woman. He also shouted at me for being okay with my daughter and her partner sleeping in the same room when they visit. I cut the line soon after.\n\nNow he's going round, telling anyone who will listen that i'm a \"bad mother without morals.\"\n\nI cannot believe I was once married to this man.\n\n  \n\n",

            "selftext": "So I read the thread about the father leaving the kids at Daycare until the last possible second and am now feeling terrible because I'm also guilty of leaving my kids at daycare for as long as possible simply to avoid having them around and so they are someone else's problem. Firstly, the centre charges by half day blocks rather than by the hour, so it makes no difference whether I pick them up when I finish at 2pm or at closing time 6:30pm because I am into the second block and pay for it in full whether I use it all or whether I use 1/3 of it. I figure since I am paying for that time and childcare, I might as well let the diapers and the tantrums and the supervision be someone else's problem. I don't play video games but use the time to read and just enjoy the silence or get things done around the home or go shopping or run errands without having to take the kids with me.\n\nI love my kids dearly, but to be completely honest, if I had my time over again, I would not have children. It took having kids to realise that I am an introvert and that I can't stand having anyone, but let alone small children around me all the time, and my kids are so clingy. I knew there would be sacrifices, but I didn't realise just how much of myself I would have to give up, just how much having them would impact my career, just how much of my social life would be lost, and just how much I would find myself wishing I didn't become a parent. I love them and there are nice moments but I'd take it all back in a heartbeat if I could. \n\nThey are 2.5 (twins) and I really don't enjoy having them around. They are very demanding and old enough to get into stuff and cause trouble, but still a bit too young to understand rules and reason. They need to be supervised every second. They are loud and never quiet. One of them always needs to be the centre of attention and it wears me down. I like having them around for about half an hour when I come home and then I just want them to go away. I love the, but I find them so suffocating. So I let them stay at daycare even though I am finished with work. \n\nI don't want to feel this way, but I do. I never thought I'd be this parent. I thought I'd be that parent who is a pinterest parent and loves spending their weekends at the park and taking their kids to do things, but I found myself being the parent who fantasises for their old life back. I thought I'd be the parent who relished family holidays at the beach, but I am the parent who spends 90% of my time dreaming of my old relaxing holidays to the Greek Islands or Japan, without the demands of children. I dream constantly of being free again. I don't want to feel this way, but I do and I know I am not alone. Those few hours where I can leave them at childcare are what keeps me sane.\n\nI don't know where I am going with this but I wish I wasn't a regretful parent. But I am. I've tried all sorts of therapy and they have all had the same conclusion - it is not PPD, it is just good old fashioned regret and wishing I made a different decision but being unable to take it back and coping as best as I can. Yeah.",

            "selftext": "Hi everyone. We just had our engagement party over the weekend and my dad broke our trust. I'm currently 6 weeks pregnant and I told him not to tell anyone about the baby. Only a handful of close family knew. During the speeches the first thing my dad said was \" we are excited for the engagement and the baby\". Everyone my fianc\u00e9 and I love and care for now know thanks to him. I called him a few days later to ask why he did that and all he said was \"because I felt like it\". He turned nasty and basically said that us wanting to wait until 12 weeks was an EXCUSE and that we \"shouldn't be afraid of what people think\" so he took it upon himself apparently to do it for us. We are PROUD of this baby. We didn't want to tell people because of the chance of miscarriage.  He called me a sook and told me to grow up. I have EVERY right to be upset. This is my baby and it was ours to tell everyone about, he stole that from us. And thanks to him, if I lose this baby EVERYONE I love will know about it. Am I taking this too far or did he definitely step over the line?\n\nEdit : Also on our phone call I poured my heart out explaining how I felt and his response was \"have a listen to it\" and made my mum take the phone back. \n\nEdit part 2 : He also said that he believed everyone had the right to know (sorry for the edits guys, parts of the phone call keep coming back to me and they all build a bigger picture)",

            "selftext": "I know I'm not alone here. I see people complain about their spouse not doing their share of the work ALL THE TIME. Usually it's the spouse playing videogames or staring at his/her phone all day. \n\nThe responses to posts like these are never camaraderie though, even though I know this is a common problem. The responses are always things like \"I would never put up with that. You better lay down the law.\" While I agree with that, it just seems like there's nowhere for people to *really* discuss this problem in detail.\n\nToday, on my \"day off\", I busted my ass caring for two kids all day. Cooked, dishes, laundry, all that shit. Tomorrow, I work a 14 hour shift at my \"real job\". What did hubby do today? Played videogames. Stopped for 1.5 hours to eat dinner, bathe older kid, and help get them ready for bed. Then I put the kids to bed when hubby rushed back to get back to his game.  \n\nNow I'm too exhausted to have any evening time to myself. I'm going to bed since I have to be up in 6 hours. \n\nWhen is MY time for videogames? When is MY time to watch Netflix and wind down? NEVER. That's when. Because even when hubby takes over child care to \"give me a break\" during the day, there's so much other shit that needs to be done around the house, that I have to use that as my opportunity to get it done. \n\nI even made a subreddit about this, r/spousesofgamers, which hasn't really taken off yet...But I know I am not the only one here. I think this is a **real phenomena** that our generation is dealing with and not voicing, because we're embarrassed. \n\nEmbarrassed that we don't \"stand up for ourselves\" enough. \nEmbarrassed that we picked a life partner who does this. \nEmbarrassed that the games are apparently more interesting than we are. \nWho knows why? But anyway, that's my rant, thanks for reading lol.",

            "selftext": "I was told to post this here instead of r/relationships, so I'm going to give it a go. There I didn't get as much advice about how to deal with this issue, so I'm hoping I might get more of that here. \n\n\nHey Reddit.\n\nSo I know I'm probably going to get a lot of flack for this post, but honestly I'm kind of at the end of my tether here and I'm not sure where to go next.\n\nMy wife and I had a beautiful son just under three months ago, and I could not be any happier than I am to be a father and to have him here. The problem is, my wife likes to chirp this phrase at me, \"you knew when we had a baby you'd have to pick up the slack\" and I think at this point it's just completely unfair. Before our son was born, we had a very equitable split of chores and duties around the house, and now I feel like instead of just adding the baby's chores to that pool and splitting it evenly from there, I end up doing everything that's not baby related, a lot of what is baby related, and have no time for anything but supporting my wife.\n\nFor some background, we both work and have two dogs and we're the stereotypical \"dog parent\" kind of people. I love our dogs, but I feel like some of the care we could give them before the baby was born just isn't possible and my wife vehemently disagrees. This includes outings, hand prepped food once a day, multiple walks a day, individual training time, stuff like that, which I'd like to hire some help with (at least a dog walker) but my wife refuses. Even though she refuses, dog care has fallen almost completely to me now.\n\nA typical day starts with me getting up at six to feed the dogs and take them on a walk. I also prep their meals (the one handmade meal a day). I've asked my wife if we can at least give them dry/canned food until the baby is a bit older, but she feels like if you can't maintain the quality of your dog's life, then you shouldn't have them at all. I let them out, check on my son, tend to anything he needs. My son won't take a bottle from me yet, so my wife at this point gets up and feeds him and I get ready for work. I then watch him and play with the dogs while she gets ready, and then her mother comes to watch our son. I have to leave earlier than her, but her mother is usually there by the time I have to leave so she gets to have low-stress time with him. I get home about two to three hours before my wife, so I get home, tend to him, walk the dogs before her mom leaves, play with him, feed the dogs, do some training with the dogs, and then my wife gets home, feeds him, spends some time with the dogs as I bathe our son, get him ready for bed, and try to make us something to eat while she spends more time with him. I watch him while she showers and de-stresses, another feeding, and while he's feeding I get my own shower. Then I do most of the cleaning the house needs since she has specifically asked her mother to not tidy too much as she feels it's our responsibility to keep the house clean. When I ask her to help me clean up, she usually says she's too tired or she just wants to spend time with our son. That's fine with me, but even on the weekends when we have equal time with him, I still end up doing almost all of the cleaning and cooking. Any time I've asked to go do my own thing for a few hours (something she does during the weekend at least for 2 hours at a time), she accuses me of not wanting to be an involved father and reminds me that my days of video games and hanging out with my friends are over for at least a few years. Totally depressing when she's seen her friends without the baby at least once a month since our son was born.\n\nSome of the reasons I can't talk to her about this:\n\nAny time I bring it up, she just reminds me that I agreed that I would pick up some of the slack that she leaves from child rearing, but I feel like I'm picking up the slack, and her load and my own.\n\nMy wife believes that since her mother is the one who contributes to our childcare, that it counts as her contribution as well which I think is completely unfair.\n\nMy wife has to get up for all night feedings, and even though I get up to make sure my son doesn't need something other than feeding in the middle of the night (as in, I'm the first to get up, check on him, run through the list, and then if he needs feeding then I wake her up if it's outside of the feeding schedule), she feels like she's getting less sleep in the night and never gets up for the dogs in the morning but also insists that they still need to be fed at 6 am every day as they used to before the baby even though I think we could feed them closer to when we need to leave.\n\nMy wife feels like just her body producing milk is more tiring and stressful than I can possibly know, so it's not fair for me to compare my childcare contributions to her feeding our kid. This is a fair point, I guess, but it's not like I can produce milk for him so what am I supposed to do about this? I do most of the changing, bathing, playing, and other minding outside of feeding.\n\nMy wife feels like she should have more time to herself than I get because her mother does the childcare to allow her to do this when I don't have someone to relieve me in a similar manner.\n\nMy wife hasn't shown any ppd symptoms and still regularly sees her doctor and therapist from before the baby to make sure. Clean bill of health from both of them.\n\nMy wife is usually so reasonable and such a thoughtful person that I don't even know who this person is that I'm married to. I feel like it's so unfair, but maybe I'm just in the wrong about it and I do need to be picking up some slack. I feel like my wife read some articles about men who don't do enough once their kids are born and is just being hyper vigilant about it with me, but I've been pulling my weight and I'm HAPPY to be doing it. I love my son. A little help?\n\nTLDR: My wife thinks I need to pick up her slack during the first few months of our baby, it's not possible but she doesn't want me to get extra help. \n\n\n**EDIT: Thanks everyone. I asked my mother in law to give us a night out tomorrow so we could talk about things, but if she still refuses to agree to the help I'm just going to move forward with it anyway since I now feel way more justified in thinking of it as a need rather than a frivolous want. I'll also talk to her doctor about possible PPD or PPA. Now that I realize that I wasn't just not doing enough, the conversation can be framed a lot differently. It does no good for both of us to be completely worn out. I really appreciate all the comments, advice, and even the bottle advice.**",

            "selftext": "I grew up in the 50's, when men did not participate in their childrens' upbringing. Housewives were the norm, then, and the duties usually fell on the mother. I will admit that my father did more than most men at that time, but post WW2 families were mostly nuclear family units, (which are a recent phenomenon), and people were categorically pressured to fit very strict stereotypes of what a father or mother should be.   My gratitude now extends to the current generation of males I see on reddit, who are proud fathers, who have broken the mold by being fathers who change diapers, stay home with their children when needed, play with them, love them and perform all the duties that were once only relegated to the mother. My own son is a dad like that, and his son is thriving. Take it from someone who has seen the evolution of men since the 50's, men who play with their boys and girls equally, and see gender equality as they raise their children. I see young men now as a great and good force for raising a generation of children who will be much loved by both parents, and I commend you all for being the change that makes this world a better place . You have exceeded all the men of past generations by your commendable parenting, your full on mastery at the hard work it takes to be a parent, and your refusal to ascribe gender roles to that work. Thanks, kids, for being such great parents to your kids. I have only HOPE for your excellent generation. signed, Grandma.",

I try to take him in the mornings a couple of times a week to let her sleep in and I also help out through the day (I often study at home) with all the little tasks such as changing diapers, feeding etc. but I maintain she has him at least 80% of the time.\n\nIn the beginning she had him almost 100% of the time but the more I accepted to take him, the more she snaps at me and the more she feels I should be having him. It's like if I take him 1 morning, she will be there the next morning as well waking me up to have him and I've lost a lot of days studying because I get up at 5 am and am exhausted by 9 am when I wake her up, have a long nap and my sleeping schedule gets messed up.\n\nNow we are definitely not the only couple with this issue so I could use some help. How much is \"fair\" for a working husband to help the stay at home mother with the children? I've heard anything from 4 hours a week to every waking hour that you are not working. Both options seem equally insane so there must be some mid value. What do you feel is fair and did you find a solution that worked?\n\nP.S. When does this get better?

            "selftext": "Trying to be concise, bear with me as I am furious. \n\nWe just moved across country (military) and my kids started a new school. My 8y daughter is in 2nd grade and I've only met her teacher once. We haven't been here very long. I was extremely close with her last teacher. I have reached out to new teacher on class dojo (school messaging app to communicate with teacher and see progress) and informed her that I am very active in my kids education and want to know about any important events. \n\nYesterday 8y daughter gets in car and informs me about this incident with the male in her class. She has mentioned him numerous times, said he cusses and the teachers do nothing about it. Apparently yesterday he took her snack and threw it. My daughter called him a troublemaker. She can have a tendency to be mouthy and we are working on that, but in no way did it deserve his reaction. He put his hands around her neck and shoved her head. She told me her neck popped 3 times. He then told her next time he was going to slam her on the ground until she was dead. \n\nLike I have taught her, she told the teacher and was sent to the nurse who said she was alright (I'm assuming, how the fuck would I know?). Nothing was done to the boy. He was not removed from class and I was not informed. \n\nI did not find out until after school so I only had the option to message her on class dojo. I was obviously furious but civil. Here was my exact message:\n\nI want to know why a little boy put his hands on my daughter and hurt her neck, and she was seen by the nurse and I wasn't informed about this? Was he suspended?\n\nHere was her reply:\n\nGood afternoon, I was going to message you about this after school. Another student did put his hand around her neck, so he was sent out of the room and I sent her to the nurse to check to make sure she was okay and the nurse said there was nothing to be concerned about. I followed up with her to make sure she felt okay and she said she felt better. I would be available to meet at 1:35 if you are available then. \n\n(My daughter said he was NOT removed from class.)\n\nMy reply:\n\nAbsolutely. This isn't the first time she has complained about this child harassing her, cursing, and just generally causing her problems. I am not blaming you, I would just like to know when these things happen especially if a visit to the nurse is needed. She said her neck popped 3 times. I have talked to her and explained that some kids don't have the best home lives or have special needs and not to be judgemental or angry, but he seems to be interfering with her education. I look forward to meeting with you tomorrow! Have a great night.\n\n\nNow, when I told my husband this he about lost it. He told her if it ever happens again to punch him, physically defend herself by whatever means necessary and that she would not get in trouble at home for it. I was extremely against this, told her NOT to do that, that it's never okay to hit people. But the more I think about it, the more I agree with him. If her teacher is not going to protect her then she needs to protect herself. I am not going to allow her to be abused at school. She is 8 years old for fucks sake. \n\nNow, I have had a talk with her about calling him a troublemaker. I did not place the blame on her but told her that sometimes our words can escalate things. She seemed to understand. \n\nNow we come to the part about the teacher. I have had almost a full 24hrs to calm down but I want to gather my thoughts before I meet with her in 2 hours and I'd like any input you can offer. If my daughter put her hands around someone's neck and said those things, I'd expect her to be suspended. That kind of violence especially at an early age should NOT be tolerated and I am going to make sure she knows I feel that way. I'm also beyond pissed that I was not immediately notified. \n\nAre there any other aspects to this story I need to consider? Thanks in advance. \n\n\nEdit: I am also meeting with the principal and telling her every single thing that happened. Including the fact the nurse cleared her of a neck injury---like does she have xray vision???\n\n\nHere are the questions I have so far:\n\nWhere was the teacher when the incident occurred?\n\nWhat discipline was used?\n\nWhat is the school's protocol for bullying and threats of violence?\n\nWere his parents notified?\n\nWhy was I not immediately notified by either the teacher or the nurse? What qualifications or equipment does the nurse have to diagnose a neck injury?\n\nWhat measures are being taken to protect my daughter? How can I reassure her that school is a safe place?\n\nWhat resources (CPS, counseling, separate education) are available for the aggressor? \n\nHad he ever hurt another child before?\n\nAnything else I should add?\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE IN COMMENTS",

            "selftext": "There was a mom this morning who posted an update to an ongoing situation with her older child sexually molesting her younger child. The mom did not share any personally identifying information. She stated that she was reaching out for support here because in her local, rural community, the types of parent support groups CPS had recommended were unavailable. She admitted to feeling alone, feeling like she could not share her story with family or friends because of the stigma, and generally feeling terribly isolated in her experience and her pain.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThe very first comment reply told her that sharing her story here was inappropriate - that she should just keep her experience to herself, and that it was a violation of her family's privacy for her to post here. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnother poster accused her of putting her son in a group home with a bunch of \"rapists\", even though it was clear from the mom's post that the placement decision was CPS's, not the mom's.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI am just so angry and sad that this mom, who is already going through something so awful and traumatic, a mom who supposedly did everything right, was made to feel shamed and even more isolated in her efforts to reach out for support here. So much so that she deleted her post and her throwaway account.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt was a minority of posters posting hurtful comments, but obviously that (already vulnerable) mom was not in an emotional position to defend herself against their vitriol. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI'm not sure if it's against the community's rules to post about this, but I really feel like the issue needs to be raised and discussed. When you reply, please remember that these are real people with real lives and real families that you are impacting. Your words have an effect, and even more so when the poster is dealing with a volatile or sensitive situation. You don't have to agree, but you don't have to shame the person either. ",

            "selftext": "I posted this in relationships but mods directed me here, so here I am. Throwaway and not really willing to post too much about my kid's issues because it's identifying.\n\nHere's the thing. One of our kids has a couple of illnesses that, on their own, are things you can live with. But also not developing on target and it's really hard to force a kid who can't even talk to take care of their disease, or help you do it. She recently tried to do a couple of different wish foundations but my kid's doctors don't score the myriad illnesses along the likes of cancer and said no. I think that's where all this Disney business came from to begin with. Plus my wife got my daughter on the disney train and she has been asking about it and every 5 bucks from the tooth fairy goes toward it in the piggy bank etc. \n\nMy wife applied for a scholarship of sorts to attend a conference near Disney directly related to one of the illnesses our child has and she got it. It's 7 days at an upscale hotel, food, conference that includes medical childcare. Other families with this issue, although not all the others, will be there. You pay for how to get there, and of course, any sight seeing or theme park visiting you do is on you. She said since it is in Orlando she's not getting that close to Disney without going. She said now is the time to take the kids because the boys won't yet be three... but they will, they will turn three a couple days after they get there, and they will do so states away from family and probably don't even qualify for free Disney entrance anyway? \n\nI said no. I think it's fucking insane, she would have to take three kids under age 7 by herself, 2 are under age 3, and she's not in good health herself. I can't imagine the problems that would abound from summer time in the heat and in a huge theme park with a sick kid number one, but with two she would be responsible for looking after who barely talk or listen as it is. She can't even take them to the grocery store. \n\nAlso, I can't go. I can't take time off work at all. I told her this and she said \"we could fly you out since you only work three days that week, and we could do the Disney days when you get there.\" We don't have the money. Hence her idea to sell her ring.\nShe's angry because the first thing out of my mouth was \"You aren't going without me.\" Neither of us have been to Disney and no, I don't want my kids to go without me. I would like to be there for that. \n\nBut that's not my only reason as you can see. She thought it was, so she has now made it possible for me to \"be flown out\" by selling her wedding ring and I am furious. But it's my fault because I didn't flat out tell her she was crazy, I just said I couldn't go. Excuse me for breaking it to her gently. \n\nShe says her ring was hers to do with as she pleases and it says nothing about her commitment to the marriage, she married me without a ring, waited years to get one (she asked me for it because when we had our first kid people kept assuming she was an unmarried teenager and that bothered her). I say she should have consulted me about this and I would have told her she was crazy before she ever sold it. \n\nNow she has $1100 dollars and she could contribute to any issue that needs fixing in our house but she doesn't want to do that, it was her ring, she wants to hire a nanny to go with her to DISNEY because I refuse to go. It makes zero sense to take the kids to Disney when they won't even remember it. They will remember having to crap in a bag if our plumbing gets any worse though, but my wife doesn't care. Disney Disney Disney. How do I make her see sense in this?\n\nTLDR I have a sick kid who is apparently not sick enough for a wish to be granted to Disney. My wife won or got a scholarship or whatever to go to a conference for one of my kid's illnesses and there are some free days that allow for Disney visits. I told her we didn't have the money, she got the money by selling her wedding ring. Now she has $1100 and no ring and I'm still not convinced but don't know how to proceed.",

            "selftext": "My parents worked a lot and my Grandma was always there to help them with us kids. My partner's mum had her mother practically living with her and assisting with her kids. They never had to pay for daycare or babysitters. That was just how it was.\n\nSo where the hell are they for us now we have kids? They've been there and done that already they say. This is their time to have easy visits and holidays. Of my four children only the oldest two have ever had sleepovers with them. They are too hard under the age of seven or eight. My youngest is two so by the time I have a night to myself it will have been around 15 years hard time haha. \n\nI know we aren't alone in this as I have heard the same thing from many of my parent friends. So much that we have all stepped in to take that role for each other that our parents are neglecting. I also know there are boomer grandparents who are going above and beyond and I respect and admire them for that.\n\nWhat about you guys? Are your parents there to help or are they too tired and busy? Sorry for the grumble, I'm very very tired ;)\n\nEdit: I am overwhelmed with the responses! I will endeavour to read through them all and respond to as many as I can, as a busy parent I won't be able to reply to all. You have raised so many good points and it is great to hear about all the different types of relationships. So many great grandparents, so many not so great....some too much. Human relationships are so complicated and I would like to make it clear that I don't feel that my folks are obligated to give more than they can :).\n\nOne very clear point is that the times have changed a lot. Our parents are working longer and struggle just like us. I hope we will get to retire some day to be there for our kids when they embark on the parenting journey. This is not just a boomer issue, it is a personal relationship and societal pressure struggle. Love to all you wonderful families.",

I lose my temper, just like my father before me, but I'm not sadistic, or violent, but I can say cruel things and lash out in frustration at random items in a room. I have trouble with an early rising three year old, and I'm running out of options to cope with a lack of sleep.      \n    \nI often look to Google for advice, and all I am increasingly finding is mom blogs. Like that's all there is. Unsolicited advice from moms that all seem to have the perfect life and appear completely self centered. I struggle to find anything written from a dad's perspective and written by someone that is not trying to portray themselves as a perfect but flawed parent.   \n   \n Where is the advice online by professionals? When did mom blogs start dominating Google searches? It's like fake news on Facebook. It's frustrating that parenting journals seem to only show the mother's journey.   \nAnyway, venting has made me feel better and forget that I was up at 5am with my three year old. ",

            "selftext": "I had my son when I was 18. My husband was 19 at the time. Needless to say, we didn\u2019t plan the pregnancy. Teenage stupidity mixed with Vodka and out came out my boy nine months later. I come from a very religious family in a small town. My father is an ex pastor and my mother has always been heavily involved with the local church.\n\nFrom when I was little, I was raised with church and religion. I used to be very passionate about Christianity, but as I approached my late teens, I will admit my faith began to wane. Because of that, I began to drift from my parents.\n\nSex before marriage was an absolute no-no in my family, so you can imagine their reaction when I told them I was with child. It also didn\u2019t help that my husband is atheist. And while they will always refute it, I know they weren\u2019t too fond of the fact that my husband is a mix of Hispanic and Black (my younger sisters told me of the racial epithets that came out of their mouths regarding my husband and my choice to be with him). They kicked me out the house and disowned me when I told them of the pregnancy.\nI moved in with my husband and his wonderful family (his family were so supportive) throughout the pregnancy and when our child was born. Couldn't have made it without them.\n\nShortly after our son was born, we moved out and got our own apartment. My parents didn\u2019t get in contact when my son was born. They didn\u2019t get in contact when I married my husband at 21 years old. All the way to when my son was 6 and we migrated to a different state. In the beginning, I did try to get back in touch with them. But eventually I gave up. The hurt and regret over everything that happened faded with time.\n\nThroughout all these years, we (as a family) have bumped into my parents from time to time. When we go back to our hometown and go to family functions (weddings, etc). It\u2019s really awkward \u2013 there is no relationship. It\u2019s like when you bump into distant relatives and don\u2019t really know what to say. It\u2019s been almost 20 years of this kind of \u201crelationship\u201d between my parents and my family.\n\nMy family and I were in our home state over the weekend. My youngest sister was getting married. My parents were there. After the church ceremony, they took me aside and spoke to me. I can tell it was very hard for them \u2013 especially my dad (he has always had trouble expressing himself). They said they regretted all the time that has passed and that they want to \u201cmake amends.\u201d They said they were sorry for everything that happened.\n\nOur son is now 17. I\u2019m so proud of the young man he has become. I still can\u2019t get over the fact he\u2019s pretty much a man now. He won a scholarship to a college in the fall and I can't get over the fact he will be out of the house come September. Time truly flies. \n\nA point my mother especially reiterated was her desire to know my son. She went as far proposing the possibility of him staying with them for a week during the upcoming summer break (which for me is too big a step - even just thinking about it; way too many things to work out right now).\n\nI told them I needed time to process. It came out of the blue \u2013 I am accustomed to a cold distance between us, so them extending an olive branch came as a shock. I have spoken to my husband thoroughly about it. We\u2019re yet to tell our son, although we will do soon.\n\nRegarding family estrangements that have gone on for a long time, have any of you experienced anything similar? \n\n",

            "selftext": "I usually trust the professionals I choose to treat my kids. As long as I know what to expect, I let them do what they are trained to do and not interfere. But when it\u2019s my kid and I\u2019m not communicated with, all trust goes out the window. \n\n\nI\u2019ve never been completely shut out of a dentist consultation, especially for a seven year old. I understand if there\u2019s a major medical procedure needing to be done and for safety not be in the room. However, don\u2019t take my kid back without me for fifteen minutes before I have to ask what\u2019s going on. That is fifteen minutes too long. \n\n\nI made an appointment for the dentist to look at one of his front teeth, which is loose but moved sideways. I wanted to be sure it wasn\u2019t impacting the other tooth or had any issues, so when I said to the receptionist on the phone \u201cpossible extraction\u201d, that doesn\u2019t mean that I just wanted them to take it out. \n\n\nThe office recently changed owners and this was the first time we\u2019ve been since then. The office staff was the same but the medical staff had changed. \n\n\nI was really confused when they called him back and asked me to stay in the waiting room, and was told because the doctor usually only prefers the patient in the treatment room. I figured they would come talk to me in the front while my son got acquainted with the treatment room. I know before he had his first cleaning, they showed him all of the equipment and tools and let him push the button to let the chair go up and down. So I waited a moment. \n\n\nAfter ten or fifteen minutes I asked at the check-in desk what was going on, because I haven\u2019t talked to the doctor and they have my son back there and I don\u2019t know what they are doing. I started getting upset and said \u201che\u2019s only seven. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s scared or what and I haven\u2019t even talked to the doctor about what I wanted him to look at. I don\u2019t understand why I can not go back there.\u201d \n\n\nThe staff got up immediately and let me go back, which was a little too late because I had already started opening the door to the treatment area. \n\n\nHe\u2019s up on the chair and I guess they were just going to pull the tooth without even talking to me first? He had already had X-rays done and the doctor and assistant were looking at them while he\u2019s laying there with the sunglasses and gauze in his mouth. \n\n\nI freaked the fuck out. I said \u201cwhat are you doing? Did you pull his tooth without talking to me?\u201d The dentist said \u201con the appointment notes it said extraction so..\u201d I said, \u201cPOSSIBLE extraction! I don\u2019t want it done unless it needed to be and wanted to make sure the tooth was not causing an issue.\u201d Thank god for his face he hadn\u2019t pulled it yet. \n\n\nHe finally said it should come out on it\u2019s own, it\u2019s not impacting the other teeth. I said \u201cso were you going to tell me that or just pull it? Especially since he\u2019s only SEVEN YEARS OLD AND CAN NOT GIVE HIS CONSENT TO TREATMENT. You already took X-rays and started treatment without talking to me!\u201d\n\n\nWere they going to tell me any of this before they just took it out? I told them it was really unprofessional to not even consult a parent, and I have never not been allowed back to sit in the room with my kid, even when my older daughter had a crown placed on a molar. That is not ok with me. None of this was ok. I was pissed and on the verge of tears I was shaking with anger and said I don\u2019t want you to touch him. We are leaving. \n\nI stopped at the check out desk and they told me there was no charge. You\u2019re goddamn right I wasn\u2019t going to give this fucker a penny. \n\nI just don\u2019t get it, and the more I think about it, I just get angrier. What if I hadn\u2019t trusted my gut? How many other parents who maybe don\u2019t question medical professionals\u2019 authority wouldn\u2019t have said something? Is this a common practice for this doctor? He\u2019s kind of young but that doesn\u2019t excuse the fact he was initiating treatment on a seven year old before he even saw me or talked to me. No one asked me anything from the moment we walked in except if my insurance and address was still correct on our chart. \n\n\nTrust your gut. Demand that you are involved in your child\u2019s health care. Don\u2019t take no for an answer. You are your child\u2019s advocate. \n",

I need some outside perspective but don't want my friends to know. \n\nI'm expecting my second child and first son. I discussed circumcision with the pediatrician. He gave me all the information and I was leaning against it but I asked his opinion on the manner. He is a male and a doctor so I wanted to hear his thoughts. He said that he wasn't here to tell other parents what to do but he is glad he circumcised his own sons. That didn't really bother me but he continued and said \"Boys are gross. Do you really expect him to keep it clean when he's a teen? They can't even clean a dish.\" \n\nHe laughed but I couldn't help myself from being upset by his comments. I like him as a pediatrician but his comments sounded rather misguided and sexist. I'm sure I am overreacting and don't know what kind of advice I am looking for. I just needed to vent. \n\nThanks for reading. ",

            "selftext": "Hey guys, I'm frustrated, so some of this post might end up projection, or venting, or whatever.\n\nMy 9 month old has a fever right now. He'd had a bad cough for the last two days or so, so he already had a Dr's appt for today. Last night his nose started running a bit and he was cranky, and then he just ended up inconsolable for a decent part of the night, confirmed he had a mild fever.\n\nThis sucks, any parent knows that. But my wife was just in full-on panic mode. She left for a month on a work trip recently, so for the month I worked, took the baby to daycare, and took care of him at home. I feel pretty in-tune with my son at this point. He's spiked mild fevers before because of teething, and I just dealt with it. Childrens tylenol, keep a good temperature where he sleeps, help him GET lots of sleep.\n\nI had a really good system too. Put my son down around 9-9:30 and he's fall asleep within 15 minutes, sometimes crying for a few minutes before passing out and then sleeping through the night.\n\nSince my wife has come home, she's completely destroyed my routine. She's always fiddling with him, and I feel like she doesn't let him get comfortable. When I have the room nice and dark and go to put him down, she wants to check on him constantly, which is fine. But he'll be asleep and she'll turn the light on or touch him and wake him up. If I don't put him down early, she'll wait until we go to bed to put him in the crib, and because we're there talking and she's lighting up the room looking at her phone, he won't go to sleep.\n\nWith this fever I mentioned, she was absolutely hysterical about taking him to the ER over it. I feel like it's so easy to just say \"Better safe than sorry\" but I firmly believed he doesn't need to go to the ER, and we didn't go because I fought her on it and he has an appointment moved up to this morning.\n\nIf we'd gone to the ER over a mild fever and cough, we'd have both been awake at 3 AM to get ready for the trip over there, waiting for an hour or more, getting seen by an ER doc who isn't a pediatrician and by then probably just being told to give him some tylenol and if it doesn't break in 24 hours to take him back.\n\nThis morning I realized that she went and had the ol' passive aggressive facebook post asking if she was \"overreacting\" (her quotes). And while a few were like \"If you think you should go then go!\" and a few who said that going to the ER might be a bit much at this stage.\n\nI'm so angry, my wife treats our child like he's a 3 month old in terms of how to deal with his problems. She won't let him sleep. And most importantly, she won't trust my judgement. \n\nI had siblings born when I was way older, when I was 16 and then when I was 18, who I helped take care of. She didn't. She's always had me around to help with the baby, and this last entire month I did it solo, while working full time, with no complaint. Quite frankly I'm mad as hell. \n\nI feel like she thinks she's automatically right about whatever her \"feelings\" are because she's a woman, or that I'm automatically wrong if we disagree because I'm a man. I'm a damn good father, and I pay a ton of attention and care to my child. I have more experience than my wife with these things, and I wish when she was panicking she would just take my god damn word for it sometimes, not disagree and then fish for ammunition from others on facebook in the form of opinions on if she is overreacting or not to justify herself.\n\nThat and I just wanted some goddamn sleep. Yeah, has a fever. Held him and sang to him for 5-10 minutes till he was mellow, put him down with a bottle and he was passed out before he even finished it.",

            "selftext": "38/M and have a 5 year old &amp; a 3 year old. \n\nI love my kids. But I can say with 110% certainty that if I had the chance to go back to my 30th birthday and do it all over again, I wouldn't have become a parent. \n\nPlease don't get me wrong. I would be devastated if something happened to them. I would take a bullet for them without thinking. I would go without dinner every night if that is what it took to feed them. I do everything to make sure they have an amazing life.\n\nIt just feels like their amazing life has come at the expense of everything I liked about my previous life and all my interests and all my hopes for the future. \n\nBut I feel like I was meant to be their \"cool uncle\" and not their \"dad\" if that makes sense. I like being around kids. I was always the cool uncle, but I didn't truly think about what it would mean for my life to not be able to give them back at the end of the day and go back to my life, a life rich with travel, free time to pursue my hobbies, the freedom to be spontaneous, disposable income. I love my children but I feel like the sacrifices are greater than the rewards and could have continued to have the joys children bring to your life without the immense sacrifices it takes to have your own. \n\nI feel like every day, I am just going through the motions doing things where the novelty has well and truly worn off. It was fun to have nieces/nephews for a few days....it is not fun to still have the kids in my house days, months, *years* later without much of a break from them at all. It's like I want them to go *home*....but they are home. They live there. They are ALWAYS in my house. I feel like I'm not really living my life anymore and it's like I'm waiting for the \"real\" dad to come and \"save\" me by picking them up and then I go back to my life and drop by to play \"cool uncle\" once a month. I hate how much it is getting me down because I feel like an asshole. I don't really think therapy will help because it is not PPD, it is just feeling like I made a big mistake. But I made the bed and now must lie in it because once you'd made the bed, you can't remake it. I can't take this decision back even though I really want to. \n \nBoth kids have ADHD and are very difficult compared to my nieces/nephews and honestly, this makes the regret feel even worse. They need expensive treatment and are just difficult all around to parent and to enforce behaviour with. I had to give up my dream career opportunity because it would involve too much travel and it is not fair to saddle my wife with the kids on her own. I haven't travelled in 6 years and miss it terribly. I miss that my wife used to put effort into her physical appearance and buying nice lingerie and having sex with me, while now she is a mother, she has let herself go and uses it as an excuse to basically be a slob and rarely have sex. I love her but it frustrates me so much. Whenever I try and talk to her about it, she starts screaming about the unfair expectations on women. I'm not at all expecting her to look like Gisele Bundchen or whatever, I just wish she'd make some effort. She is very overweight honestly bordering on obese and I've lost most of my attraction to her and it's like she doesn't care at all. \n\nHaving kids means I won't retire early and will be working much longer. I'd can't remember the last day I just got to do something for myself. I spend all my money on the kids and hate that I resent it. I had to move out into the burbs and don't like it. I hate my \"parenting lifestyle\" and miss my pre-kids marriage. I hate that I have such selfish feelings but they are what they are and I just. Yeah. I love them but wish they were not mine and I was the \"uncle\". \n\nI don't know. Anyone else feel this way so I can feel less alone? ",

            "selftext": "Some background: My mom and my daughter are really close. They see each other almost every day and my daughter freaking adores her. My MIL sees my daughter about once every 2 months or so (they live farther away; my parents are local). She and my daughter are also close.\n\nAlso, this is kind of uncomfortable, but...my mom is an objectively beautiful woman, in a modelesque kind of way. Always has been. Normally I don't focus on this at all, by the way, but it's relevant to the title. To give you an idea, my mom kind of looks like Julie Bowen or Christie Brinkley. She's 20 years younger than my MIL and she's a current marathon runner to boot (she's in way better shape than me). My MIL is a good looking woman too, but she's 75 and looks...75. Anyway, I feel awkward even writing that, but my MIL has always been a bit insecure about my mom in all ways and it's not completely irrational, I guess, especially since my daughter thinks my mom hung the moon.\n\nThe other day, my MIL was playing Princesses with my daughter, which is her favorite game with both grandmas. Like I said, they have a good relationship, but my daughter thinks my mom is The Greatest Person Alive and my MIL is currently painfully aware of that. It's consistently been a sore subject for my MIL, who gets hurt pretty much every time my mom is mentioned, let alone with the adoration my daughter bestows on her. In general, we try to redirect the conversation away from the topic of my mom when my MIL is over but I can't control everything my kid says at all times.\n\nI wasn't there for this (I was prepping lunch), but apparently, my MIL reached for the purple crown and my daughter shrieked, \"No, Grandma, that is PRETTY GRANDMA'S crown! You can wear the blue crown.\" And I know that's what she said because my MIL immediately stood up, walked away from my daughter, and told me she was leaving because my daughter has hurt her for the last time. She was crying, while my daughter watched on, confused. I just told my MIL that we'd talk to her later as she left (\"We'll see about that!\" and she slammed the door). My daughter was confused and we had a talk about how talking about physical characteristics isn't a nice way to differentiate, and also about being flexible in playtime. I think she kind of understood, but was mostly pretty shaken up and sad that her grandma left so abruptly.\n\nSo now my MIL refuses to talk to my daughter. This is where I'm a little pissed. She wants my daughter to call her and apologize (by leaving a message, not in conversation - she's \"too hurt\" to interact), and to promise to never mention my mom again. I think this is really unreasonable and that, frankly, this whole situation is kind of part and parcel with kids (i.e., don't take what a 4 year old says personally unless you want to end up rocking in a corner), but my husband is really indignant on his mom's behalf and thinks we should consider balancing out the time spent between grandmas...which would mean we'd see my mom less, rather than see his mom more (work schedules, etc.) I'm also not particularly comfortable with that because I don't think my mom should be punished for this and also my daughter is *4 years old* and definitely did not mean to hurt her grandma. I'll help her apologize but that's about as much as I'm willing to offer.\n\nAm I being unreasonable? How would you handle this?",

            "selftext": "I need advice. Obviously we screwed up as parents, but I need help with figuring out how to proceed. This is my wife's account but she asked me to write everything. \n\nMy son is 14, soon to be 15. He has aspergers and sensory processing disorder. He is very high functioning and for the most part lives a typical life for a teen. \n\nAgainst the odds (he's less than smooth, likely due to aspergers) he got a girlfriend in the beginning of 8th grade last year. We'll call his girlfriend \"Ann\". When they started hanging out we spoke to our son about consent, safer sex practices, and we expressed a desire that he wait to get physical with Ann until they are both at least a bit older. My son reacted a bit childishly at the time, seemed a bit grossed out, and brushed off any need to discuss sex further. \n\nWe thought we did the right thing, had the conversation about sex, and after that didn't worry about it.\n\nAnn seemed to be a nice girl. A year older than my son but in terms of maturity they seemed on even terms. Ann has always been kind to my son and patient when he gets over stimulated. They got along well and we even met Ann's parents at a school function. They seemed like nice, average people. \n\nSix months into Ann and my son dating my son came to me and told me he had to tell me something and he didn't want me to be angry. I braced myself for trouble at school, poor grades, something along those lines. Instead he tells me that Ann is pregnant and he is the father. \n\nI could not believe it. I asked him over and over if he was sure. He said he was sure, Ann showed him the pregnancy test, and she is going to tell her parents that night.\n\nA lot of things have happened since then. \n\n- Ann's parents were upset at first but quickly (a little too quickly I think)  they accepted it and began actually acting excited for a grandchild. I cannot relate to those feelings. \n\n- Ann and her parents would not consider abortion or adoption even considering our children's ages (14, and 15).\n\n- Ann decided to keep the baby and had a healthy pregnancy and birth. \n\n- My son talked about how he intended to help Ann and be a father to this child. He did not think it would be very hard. We assured him that newborn children and beyond are very difficult to raise and it would not be easy in any sense.\n\n- My SO and I have been devastated and feel like we have failed as parents and failed to be involved enough to prevent this. I take full responsibility for not preventing this situation. I struggle every day to get up and face the world knowing I've failed in such a serious way. \n\n- My wife insisted once the baby was born that a paternity test be done just to be sure my son was the father. Ann's parents were very offended by this and it led to some tension. My son is the father. \n\nNow on to the real issue. After the paternity test Ann's parents were offended at what such a test implies. They no longer wish to speak to my wife and I. \n\nMy son was present for the (very awkward) birth and he was vocal about not wanting to see it happen and not wanting to be stuck sitting around at the hospital. We told him tough luck and that this was going to be the first of many things he's going to have to do even if he doesn't enjoy it. He said the smells and lights at the hospital bothered him (again, he has  sensory processing disorder). We did not let him leave though. \n\nMy son has not enjoyed holding his daughter or caring for her. Ann and her parents do 99% of the care for the baby but my son goes there after school each day to spend time with Ann and baby. He tells us he hates it. He can't stand the baby screaming and crying. He can't stand the smell of breast milk or poop coming from the baby. He had his first melt down in years while at Ann's house when the baby would not stop crying. He basically had a tantrum in front of Ann and her parents about not liking the baby. \n\nAnn's parents told him not to come back. They expressed that they will seek child support from us but do not want my son around Ann or the baby anymore. My son is thrilled to be let off the hook. We don't know how to feel. \n\n1) Do we as the grandparent's of a minor parent have to supply child support? \n\n2) Should we allow our son to just ignore the fact that he had a baby with someone and just return to normal teenage life? \n\n3) Should we take Ann and her parents to court to fight for at least partial custody of a baby that my son wants nothing to do with? \n\nI have no idea how to handle this situation and we are at the end of our rope. Everyone else involved seems ready to let my son off the hook in terms of responsibly to this child except my wife and I. But we don't know what the right thing to do is. \n\nCan someone, anyone, relate? What can we do? What should we do? I know we failed as parents but I still want to try and do what's best from here on out. ",

One day my wife's note was found by a boy named Max in my son's class and read aloud to his table. Needless to say my son came home quite embarrassed. Since I'm currently unemployed I went to have lunch with my son at school the next day. Towards the end of lunch, he points the boy out to me. We have always preached turning the other cheek, telling the teacher, etc, but something about this kid's face made all those teachings fly out of window. I told my son \"now listen, I'm going to tell you something you can say to him but you cannot tell your mother\". My son replies that he'll keep our secret so I give him a pretty mild burn and tell him to use it discretely. Fast forward to that evening and my wife is signing the daily conduct sheet upon which is written \"Your son came into the classroom after lunch and yelled to the entire class that Max's mother doesn't send him notes because she doesn't love him\".

            "selftext": "When my daughter asked for my help to get her on birth control I was just glad she was being responsible with her health as she was just starting high school.\nWhen she asked me what she had to know before and during having sex and she was 15, I thought oh well, if she's going to anyway... Tried to let her know I wouldn't get in the way\nbut to consider all the things that might not make it a good idea, but otherwise told her how I imagined a sex life should ideally start and maintain so that she'd be as safe as a sexually active\nteenager can be. And I accepted there was definitely someone she intended to use that wisdom with. She has since mentioned a boyfriend here and there. Not a surprise.\n\nHowever we had never met the boyfriend, and it's much more of a surprise to learn that he is a 27yo adult leaving in a neighborhood nearby. He is apparently an engineer living alone in a house he bought recently.\nLikes the same music, TV shows, video games and outdoors stuff as her. Just doesn't acknowledge anything is off here.\n\nI started to talk to her about how they were going to cut all contact, and she told me she didn't want to and we couldn't force her to. I told her I didn't want to just let her see it but he was going to jail\nfor this and she told me to try and we'll see about that.\n\nI have a friend who's a criminal lawyer and I gave her a call. Bad news. She told me I have no say in my daughter's sex life, and either what happens is illegal and I can report it, or legal and I'll just have to\nlet it be my daughter's problem. In this case, she is 15 and consenting so it's legal. She brainstormed with me a few other angles to press charges on him. She asked if she spent nights at his house (obviously without\ntelling me) but no, she had a few unsupervised nights out that I suspect she spent with him but it was not under his control and we had approved the night (aware that she'd see her boyfriend but trusting we had taught\nher to be safe.) She asked if he was waiting to pick her up outside her school but apparently not. She asked if he was giving her gifts that would make her depend less on us (and therefore undermine our authority and\ndepend more on him) but I didn't notice anything. She might have gotten a couple of jewelry, though their \"relationship\" covered Christmas and her birthday so apparently it's questionably abusive gifts. In other words\nshe was trying to find ways to show the boyfriend is overriding our authority on our daughter but we couldn't find something a court typically acknowledges. I'd need to find out dirt on him that isn't related to his\n\"relationship\" with her, it could be enough just to demonstrate he displays obscene characteristics. That would enable to come to court and say he's voluntarily endangering her with his corrupting lifestyle.\n\nBut so far, my friend says I have nothing, laws are just what they are.\n\nSo I went to have another discussion with her, acknowledging that maybe, indeed the legal route wouldn't have the effect I thought. But we could still force them apart, by just sending her away and force her, by our\nlegitimate authority, to stay there. She told me he would follow her and that would be the same as here. I told her we could buy him out to break up with her. She told me good luck with that. I told her we can have\nconstant surveillance on her by driving her from/to places and grounding her to the house. She told me that's the same as denying her a life, and if we do that we can forget about her being honest with us, she'll just\ntell us what we want to hear and lie her way into getting her life back, never forgetting we locked her up in the house. In a nutshell, it looks like she won't accept we just tell her to separate from him.\n\nI took her mobile and decided to look through it, and I noticed that actually this guy is not completely on the same page as her. He said in their latest messages, clearly after she told him they were caught, that he\nwouldn't help her destroy her relationship with us, her parents. That he will not encourage her to escalate a conflict. That if we say we will force her to break up, he will comply to our will rather than let her fight\nus on it. He also says that when she'll be 18 we will have less control on her life and we will be the ones to be forced to accept a lot of what she wants if we want a loving relationship with her, but before 18 it's\nthe other way around and he will not help her destroy our loving relationship. So he told her she can go back to him after she's 18 and so if she wants, and all he can do now is promise her that he will be patient and\nfaithful to her in the meantime, and not expecting the same from her nor that she will necessarily go back to him.\n\nI'm starting to think that looking at the situation from a distance, this guy is a little reasonable in this issue, a lot more than my daughter at least, and there may be some value talking it out with him directly\nrather than just trying to submit my daughter into obediance. That would have to be me alone talking with him though, because if my husband was involved there would be no talking and the person in prison would be\nmy husband soon.\n\nThink that in this horrible situation, the least bad I can try for is to talk to her \"boyfriend\" about how they must separate?\n\n---\n\n**Short update:** I'm overwhelmed and thankful for all the attempt to help me. This is really appreciated. But I can't answer literally everwhere so I have to pick where I do. I promise I read everything direclty responding to me though. I'm doing this short update to give an idea where we're at now.\n\nThe police, as my friend predicted, is taking it a lot like \"it is not our job to find for you something illegal about two persons who want to have sex legally.\" Apparently the law says at what age justice is interested to know, and beyond it it's not and they are tired to have to give explanations.\n\nBut I have since become terrified that the nuke approach would break something too big with my daughter and I's relationship. Okay she didn't want to tell me about her boyfriend but beside her love life, we were so close and loving! I gave her her mobile back, apologized for reading it, and told her we need to be open to each other about the situation, but it's making everything complicated as her dad will not be calm about it when he knows.\n\nI called the boyfriend and he was surprisingly well-spoken, polite and understanding. He confirmed that he did not want to help our daughter antagonize us and he would break up with her if that's what it boils down to. But we agreed that my daughter is not stupid: if we decide to make him break up with her she will see it as her parents forcing the separation even if he agrees to it. I've decided to wait and see a little for now and not try to separate them until further decision, so that my daughter won't hold it against me. We've actually hugged and talked about good times again, that we had together, that she had with her friends, that she had with him. It's... not like one would imagine. It's confusing.\n\nI invited the guy to have a meal with us, but not dinner. Too soon to involve her father that I don't want behind bars. We're all free for lunch today so that's when we'll have him. I will ask him why he's dating someone so young and what he thinks about their difference of place in life and maturity. Also what about women his age.\n\nI don't know what next but I hope my daughter will realize it is all legitimate conversation and food for thoughts.",

I absolutely admire that kids will make the effort to wash cars on a hot day, go door to door selling candy or whatever and awkwardly explain to strangers why they expect them to pay $4 for a chocolate bar, or stand outside the grocery store, smiling at every patron, hoping someone will come and buy their cookies or caramel popcorn. I think it teaches kids a great lesson about working for what you want, so I will buy whatever they are selling. \n\nOn the flip side, I refuse to buy from their parents. I don\u2019t see that the child is learning anything from their parents selling their stuff for them. My parents didn\u2019t sell my Girl Scout cookies for me. I don\u2019t bring my kid\u2019s school fundraiser stuff to work. I just don\u2019t believe in it.\n\nSo, one of my friends texted me tonight that she still had not received my cookie order. I texted her back that I still had not received a phone call from her 7 year old daughter, asking me if I\u2019d like to buy cookies. Considering they\u2019re $4 a box, selling them should teach the girls something. I told her I would take 4 boxes if her kid called me and sold them to me. She called me and ripped me a new one, calling me all kinds of names and telling me that my boys were going to turn out awful if I didn\u2019t change. So...because, when they are old enough to join Boy Scouts, I\u2019m not going to sell their overpriced popcorn for them, they\u2019re going to turn out awful. Right. As it is, her kid is so outrageously spoiled, I don\u2019t think she even knows how to smile or say \u201cThank you.\u201d \n\nRant over. Am I crazy for wanting to buy Girl Scout cookies from an actual Girl Scout? \n\nUpdate: I ordered the cookies. Because this isn\u2019t the hill I want to die on. She\u2019s going through a rough time right now, and even though I don\u2019t think I\u2019m wrong, I\u2019m not going to make things worse and possibly lose her over 4 boxes of cookies. We\u2019ll shelve the fight until next year! ",

            "selftext": "I guess I'm just trying to make sense of this in my head. We have always been fortunate in that my mother has always provided the bulk of childcare for our two kids for next to nothing. At this point we do have our 2yo in part-time daycare and our son is now in kindergarten, but my mom stays with them daily from the time they get out of school until I get home from work. She lives about a half hour away from us, so it is really really nice of her to do this every day for us. We both work in the opposite direction. \n\nWe are looking to buy a house within the next few months, and I have honestly kind of fallen in love with the area that I work in (which is about an hour away from where my mother lives.) If we  ended up buying a home in that area, obviously my mom would no longer be able to help us out with the kids. In addition, homes are quite a bit more expensive in that area. When I think about it, I can see that logically we are much better off buying something in the town we live in now, where we can buy a house for cheaper and still get help from my mom. But my mom is 75 years old and has some health issues, so realistically I just don't know how much longer she'll even be able to help anyway. And even if she still is able to help, I know that not everyone has that option and somehow they make it work. I just don't understand how parents in our income bracket (say 100k combined income, but our area has a high cost of living) can comfortably afford a mortgage, their bills, and a huge amount in childcare? Do they just live paycheck to paycheck? Are they actually able to save anything? I get that if you are below a certain income you can get help with childcare costs, but we are nowhere near that bracket. I can't even imagine paying basically a second mortgage payment in the form of a childcare bill. I don't see how it's even possible, quite frankly. Not to mention the fact that we're considering the possibility of a third child, which would only make things harder. \n\nIf anyone could shed some light, I'm all ears. I want to make sure we make the right decision on where to buy. The area we live in now is ok, but it's a bit of a lower income area and therefore the schools aren't very highly rated. The area my husband and I work in is higher income and has better schools. It seems like a great place to raise a family, whereas the area we're in right now is just ok. But homes are cheaper here, and we have my mom's help (at least for now.) I'd love to hear your thoughts! Thanks in advance.",

My mom could have been more welcoming, but my wife could have been more accepting of people have different personalities. \n\nBut lately, it seems like the fact that my mom and my wife aren't close has led to my wife deciding that my mom isn't \"entitled\" to a relationship with our daughter. \n\nEvery time my mom interacts with the baby (which is mostly on FaceTime and an occasional out of state visit), there's something my wife is complaining about. On FaceTime, she says my mom is too \"shrill\" (she uses a high pitched lilting voice, like you're supposed to with babies) and overstimulates the baby (baby seems fine to me?). In person, my mom \"oversteps\" by asking if she can push the stroller or asking if she can hold the baby (at least she asks? and my mom takes no for an answer). \n\nOne time my wife admitted that she feels like my mom thinks she can swoop in and have a relationship with *her* (wife's) daughter even though she never put in any effort towards a relationship with wife, and that's \"just not how it works.\"\n\nNow, it's true, my mom could have done more to get to know my wife. My wife is really extroverted and comes from a big family, where my mom is really shy and cautious, and has trouble letting people in. It feels like my wife wants to punish my mom for not being the mother-in-law she expected. But honestly, my mom is just a reserved person, not a bad one. She respects my wife and our parenting, and so I feel like my wife's perspective is a vendetta. \n\nOutwardly with my mom, I support my wife, but I feel like she's trying to alienate my mom from my daughter and I'm not actually cool with that. Any advice on how to handle? I want my mom and my daughter to have a good relationship, but it feels like my wife doesn't want that to happen.\n\nFWIW, we've let her own mom watch the baby overnight and we've had friends and other relatives watch her multiple times, so it's not like she's paranoid in general about how people interact with the baby. It's all focused on my mom.",

            "selftext": "My 12 year old has a gap in between his two front teeth. The gap isn't major but noticeable. His dentist has been recommending braces for a couple of years and would like to get him started soon. My son doesn't want braces and says he is fine having the gap in between his teeth. I personally would like for him to get braces because I think it will look better once they are removed. We have already had a kid go through braces and his smile is so much better now. He is glad he did it. \n\nWe are struggling to find the balance between body autonomy and making a parenting decision. We have a younger son with Type 1 and we have allowed him to make some of his own decisions in regards to treating his disability so that is probably clouding our judgment of how much involvement we should have here as parents. \n\nShould we force the braces issue or allow him to make this decision on his own? Before anyone suggest it, invisiline is not an option for him. It would be more expensive and we don't trust that he would keep it in for the required amount of time.\n\nThanks. \n\nEdit: Thanks for the comments. I think it is a little funny how split people seem to be. I am either going to make my kid hate me for forcing it or make him hate me for not forcing it. Easy decision. ",

Or when he gets real tired and grouchy. Things like that, sometimes mentioned only in passing. But each time I\u2019ve read it, that part always stands out to me. \n\nAnd the weird part is, the comments rarely seem to address it. They\u2019ll discuss the relationship in general and the kids (this is r/parenting after all) but the idea that a woman is genuinely afraid of their partner, that is somehow normal?\n\nAnd then I realized, I was looking at if from a male perspective. I\u2019ve never, ever been in a relationship where I was afraid of my partner physically. I\u2019m not even a big dude, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been with someone I couldn\u2019t for sure overpower if I had to. And I think for a woman, most relationships have got to be on the other side of that.\n\nSo, for most women, it must be absolutely terrifying to have someone losing their shit and you have no chance of physically controlling this person. And what\u2019s more, that has got to be a nearly universal experience. No one talks about it because it IS kind of a constant. And I\u2019m the slow one for not realizing sooner that yeah, it is scary to have a person way bigger than you yelling and screaming. \n\nAnd then I thought about the times I\u2019ve lost my temper, yelling and slamming shit in my house, and how brave my wife must be to stand up to that. Even though she knows I would never hurt her, it\u2019s got to be scary. \n\nAnd how must it feel for a kid to see that? A literal giant capable of destroying your whole world, no idea what\u2019s going to happen. That\u2019s a whole other rabbit hole. \n\nI\u2019m gonna try to do better, I guess is what I\u2019m saying. Thanks for listening y\u2019all. ",

            "selftext": "This post has been a long time coming. About a year ago we agreed that I\u2019d return to work and my husband would stay home with our son (2). We agreed that my husband would get a job in the fall and I would reduce my hours to half time so our son could start daycare and we could prepare for our new baby (due in May). \n\nNot only has he not gotten a job, he\u2019s put in the absolute minimum effort into finding one and doesn\u2019t do anything with our son ALL. FUCKING. DAY. My husband turns on YouTube for him while he plays on his phone. I\u2019m not anti-screen time by any stretch, but until I laid down an ultimatum that my husband couldn\u2019t see his friends until he took our son outside a minimum of 3 times a week, he literally wouldn\u2019t leave the house with him. \n\nHousework has always been an issue for us but it\u2019s at an absolute boiling point now. I\u2019m the tidier of the two of us and I\u2019m not perfect (I don\u2019t always clean up every single dish immediately after cooking, sometimes I don\u2019t put my clothes straight into the hamper, etc) but he does VERY little. If he does the dishes, he loads the dishwasher and runs it but I have to unload it. He lets the dishes pile up on the sink because the dishwasher is full. If he cooks something, he leaves the pan soaking in the sink for days and repeatedly says \u201cI\u2019m not leaving it for you.\u201d He doesn\u2019t clean our son\u2019s bibs so they are constantly full of old food and his high chair is absolutely filthy. If he washes a load of laundry, he dumps out the clothes on the bed and leaves them for me to fold.  \n\nThe worst part about all of this is that he acts like it\u2019s because the baby is requiring his every second of attention, but I know he\u2019s doing next to nothing with him *all day*. Talking about this gets me no where. No matter I try to bring it up or tiptoe around the issue, he either gets angry and confrontational or acts like he literally cannot comprehend what I\u2019m saying. We just had a huge fight because the sink was piled with dishes and it stunk, and I asked him to clean it. I had just gotten home from taking our son out and giving my husband a few hours at home alone. I go upstairs to shower and take a small break (about an hour). I come downstairs, husband is sitting on the couch playing Madden while baby watches a video. I ask him about the dishes and we get into a huge fight. He said that if I wanted it done by a certain time, I should have said that. So not only do I have to delegate the task that should already be his, I have to actually specify the time. \n\nI hate this. I hate feeling like his mommy. Our sex life is at absolute zero, I have lost any sense of attraction to him I ever had. When you add the fact that he\u2019s not showering or brushing his teeth regularly, I am absolutely disgusted by him. I feel so overwhelmed with working full time and having to do a majority of the housework. I\u2019m sure people will say he\u2019s depressed but do I literally have to manage him seeing a doctor or therapist? I did do that work for him, years ago, and he did absolutely nothing she recommended. It was a total waste of money. Same thing with marriage counseling a year ago, he said he \u201cdidn\u2019t get it\u201d and consequently nothing changed. \n\nHe is definitely not all bad. He is a very supportive partner and has absolute endless patience with our son. I know that I am no pony ride myself, but our marriage is in the shitter and I feel like it\u2019s all on me to either change my expectations (which I find unfair because it places all the household responsibility as well as working on my shoulders only) or to drag him through the steps of making a change. \n\nIn any case I feel overworked, exhausted and at my limit. I feel shallow saying that I left the father of my children because he wouldn\u2019t clean up. I know the working parent still has to do somethings around the house, but I feel completely taken advantage of. If I try to leave the mess to him to clean, I end up with a filthy house and a child that sits inside watching TV all day. \n\nI welcome anyone\u2019s thoughts, even if they don\u2019t favor me. \n\n",

            "selftext": "I want to start it by saying that my relationship with my mother has been great. She is helpful, supportive, and kind. This is not meant to be a rant against her. \n\nMy wife and I are currently taking an evening  class. My parents watch our kiddo (20mo) once a week. Recently my mother let it slip to my wife that she had taken him to Mass. My mother quickly changed the subject afterwards and my wife didn't quite know how to respond. I was told a couple of days later. \n\nMy parents are very religious and tried to raise four religious children (church twice a week, private religious schools, active involvement in parish events, and they led by example). As adults only one of us has stayed the course and he's still in college. I know this disappoints them greatly. There was one specific day, when I was about 20, where I talked openly about religion with my parents and it left a sour taste in everyone's mouth, and hurt the relationship for a time.  Time healed that. \n\nMy parents know we did not have our son baptized. They know we don't take him to church. They have been explicitly told we are atheists and did not plan on raising our son religious. And yet she brought him to Mass, and we only know this because she let it slip. She knows we wouldn't like it, but she took him and hid it from us. I am frustrated, my wife is irate. Something needs to be said. \n\nBut... I don't know how to say it. I have relied on my parents love and support in hard times. They are wonderful people who I do not want to distance myself from. I feel some residual guilt from not being the Catholic they wanted. I feel like she only took him to Mass because she really cares for his soul. It's misguided, but I kinda get it. I want to say, \"don't take him to church.\" I want to say, \"I'm frustrated you hid this from me.\" I want to say, \"my wishes as his parent need to be respected.\" But, I also want to keep our good relationship. I know I am quick to anger. I know that when I get into arguments I burn bridges. I'm working on it. So I guess my question is, how do I address this situation with tact. How do I bring it up. What should I say? What should I be prepared for?\n\nTl;dr: My mother took my kid to church against my wishes. I want to let her know this was not ok, but am struggling to find the right way to do so.  ",

            "selftext": "\nToday my youngest child and I had 3 hours to kill as we waited for my oldest who was at a birthday party.\n\nAt about hour 2 and a half, my daughter had fallen asleep in her stroller.  She was dressed in a t-shirt, hoodie, pants, socks, wool booties (Padraigs - to specify so you know how hot they are) and was covered with a blanket.  I checked on her and noticed she was getting a bit warm, so I took off her boots.\n\nI went to the register to pay for my purchases and a woman in her mid 60's walked by, turned to her daughter and loudly said, \"that baby isn't even wearing boots...can you believe that?!\" Initially, I was shocked.  I thought this kind of thing only happened in weird, overdramatic Facebook posts.  I responded with, \"her shoes are in her stroller, I just took them off because she was getting hot\".  The woman turned and disappointingly shook her head at me.  I came unglued.  Blackout unglued.  I didn't yell, I didn't swear, I didn't get mean, but I did stand up for myself.  The look on their faces told me no one had ever spoken like that to them before.\n\nThe point of my post is this: if anyone ever makes you feel less because of how you're raising your child - use your voice.  Don't allow mother-in-laws, siblings or strangers to disrespect you, undermine you and make you insecure about what you are choosing to do.  If a person was genuinely concerned about my child not having shoes on, I'd like to think they would offer a hand and speak to me in a respectful, conversational manner.  When someone walks by you, makes a loud comment regarding the state of your children, they want to hurt you, embarrass you and make you feel small.  Their intention is to shame you into becoming a better parent...which...turns out, isn't a thing.\n\nWhen people speak up against these comments and allow others to know that they aren't welcome or appropriate, they stop.  I guarantee you this wasn't that old woman's first time making a mean comment to someone.  No one wakes up one day and says, \"I'm going to be awful to strangers\".  These types of people are built up over years of others letting them get away with small things until eventually, they mom-shame a random woman on a Sunday morning.  So, use your voice.  Make them stop.  Make them stop for the next mom or dad who they are going to hurt with their words.  \n\nThat's all I want to say.  Don't let people be dicks.",

            "selftext": "It's my worst fears come to reality. Everyone tells you that military relationships don't work out, there's always infidelity. I heard that since the first day I stepped on base. I knew the challenges being in the military would present to a relationship but I also thought my then girlfriend and now wife would weather the storm with me. \n\nI chased after my goal with her giving me all the support I could have asked for. She was amazing and I couldn't believe how lucky I was. I'm currently living my dream of being a pilot in the USAF and before about a week ago, I could not have possibly been happier with my life. My wife and I have a 5 year old little girl and I can't even put into words how much I love her. We also have another on the way.\n\nMy wife confessed to me last week that she cheated on me years ago, around the same time she got pregnant with our daughter. I told her then that I didn't care about anything else right then other than making sure my daughter was actually my daughter. And she isn't. \n\nIt hurts more than I thought it would. When I came home and saw her I ran to the bathroom to cry and told her daddy was sick. I even felt sick because I was still calling myself her daddy. \n\nMy wife has said the word 'sorry' to me so many times it doesn't even sound like a real word anymore. Yesterday she was begging me to tell her what she could do to start to make up for it. I told her to find the father because she deserves to know her real dad given that he isn't some terrible person.\n\nAnd wouldn't you know it, guy is an Airman. Which makes this worse for some reason.\n\nAll I can think about to keep sane is how to handle this in the best way for Abril. She needs to have this handled well by the adults in her life. So I'm wondering how to put the emotions to the side for her sake. \n\n\nEdit: I can't respond to everyone so I decided to edit the original post so that hopefully you'll all be able to see it. I very read over very many of your comments and messages and I've let myself cry with my mom, as well as my wife's parents who are both very loving and supportive to me. I'm not sure how I'll handle things with my wife, but I know that Abril is the most important thing in my world and I just needed to spend some time with her. I'm sitting outside her school now and I'm going to spend the rest of the day with her.\n\nTo the people who have thanked me for my service, I'm not deserving of such gratitude. I joined because I wanted to fly. I'm not one of the heroes who really deserve your kindness. That said, I am thankful for it. \n\nTo my fellow service men and women, thank you for your solidarity. It's nice to know there are people out there who truly know what this situation looks and feels like.\n\n",

They have two girls who have had head lice for *months*. I went over to their house for a party (she assured me after the last time they were \"clean\") but both my kids and *I* got them too. Their girls have infested everyone in the neighborhood and everyone they've come in contact with and no one will let them over the threshold anymore, or go over to play, obviously. When I offered the mom a tube from my Sklice stash, which is like a $60 gift, TYVM, she said no, she and her husband did not \"agree\" with using \"pesticides,\" they are going to keep combing and laundering, per some web site they saw. Which she sent a link to, but thanks, I'm going to listen to the pediatrician, and also whatever method clearly obviously doesn't fucking work for shit! \n\nI was going to write them off as crackpots but THEN another parent in carpool told me they ALSO don't \"believe\" in \"chemical\" head louse treatments. WHAT THE HELL YOU GUYS?! I can't find anything online about head louse treatment being bad! Unless you drink it or something! If setting my kids' hair on fire would get rid of lice, frankly, I will set their hair on fire. I can't figure out where these people are coming from, at all, and I feel terrible for their kids. If it is just that bad, just shave their head already so they can have friends?\n\nSo my question is have any of you heard anything about louse treatments being harmful? I haven't heard/can't find one thing, but if I'm poisoning my kids horribly I guess I would like to know. ",

I am fairly new to the south, my husband and I are not from this area and I fully understand that people do things (including raising children) differently. Tonight a large group of people, many with kids, all from the military (my husband's work) went out to a Japanese restaurant. I am a BIG fan of sushi, and I typically let my 15 month old try whatever is on my plate (within reason, I don't give him martinis or jalapeno poppers) So I was giving him bites here and there, he loved the fried rice and had his own serving of that, enjoyed the raw salmon, thought raw tuna was okay, didn't like yellowtail, but LOVED the raw salmon eggs so much that I ended up ordering him two pieces of salmon egg sushi just for him. I thought nothing of this and was even kind of proud that my 15 month old was willing to eat some of my favorite kinds of sushi! My husband snapped some great pictures and I posted one of my 15 month old eating the sushi on Instagram. I then put my phone away, forgot about it, and went bowling with the other military families. Well.....at the end of the night a few husbands told my husband that their wives were \"concerned\" that 1. I was feeding my child such unhealthy food (uh what?!? Sushi? I've seen the Little Debbies in your cabinet, Barbara) 2. That I was 'forcing' my child to eat gross things he didn't like, and he would have a bad relationship with food because of it and 3. That they saw my post and I was going to get CPS called on me because sushi is not appropriate toddler food. ARE YOU FORKING KIDDING ME. If it was just one of the wives, alright but SIX of them banded together to get their husbands to talk to my husband about my \"abusive food behavior\"....ughhhhh",

I was only 20 at the time, but I felt like things weren't right.  I felt like I needed help.\n\nI went to the hospital, and the staff assumed I was tired of being pregnant (honestly, I was, but there were other issues too).\n\nThen my son had a late decel on the monitor that lasted 10 minutes.  If I had understood the significance of that, I would have demanded an immediate c-section.\n\nI was 20 and naive.  They admitted me for observation overnight, and the prolonged late decels continued.  Instead of a morning c-section, they started pitosin as soon as they decided my son was in trouble.  The late decels continued for 9 hours until he was delivered.\n\nNow, he needs physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy.  He can't tie his shoes, write, or type.  He can't play team sports.  He has trouble with sitting, standing, walking, and running.\n\nEvery time there is a new life experience that he misses out on, the wounds are reopened.  I try never to show my guilt or sadness in front of him, but it just kills me that he was robbed of so many things because we let him stay in a dangerous situation for too long.\n\nThe natural childbirth advocates, however, would count that as a success.  They rate doctors according to their c-section rates, not the birth complication rates.  A doctor who acted immediately to save my son's neurological function would be vilified as \"wanting to get to the golf course.\"\n\nNatural childbirth advocates have no medical training, but have created a hostile environment in which there are negative consequences for prudent medical treatment.  I was never a proponent of natural childbirth, but our family now pays the price for their pressure and propaganda in a daily basis.",

            "selftext": "I am feeling pretty shocked and upset right about now, but I need some honest feedback. I have a 15 month old son and I dressed him up and entered him into our small town fall festival costume contest. So a little background about the contest: they do it by age group so 0-3, 4-6, 7-10, 11-15, 16-18, and 18+ obviously my son was in 0-3, which goes first. Each kid is taken across the stage by a parent and asked 2 random questions by judges and then at the end they arrive at a 0-3 age group town winner. So we registered, got in line, and as we were waiting in line one of the directors of the fair came over and said we would not be allowed to compete because the costume violated the rules. I asked what rule it violated and she said it was inappropriate in the age group, I asked to see the rule, the line literally just states \"costumes must be age appropriate\" I look up and there is a toddler girl in my son's age group dressed in daisy dukes and a crop top as a cow girl, which is apparently age appropriate and my son's is not. \n\nHis costume was: Henry the 8th, I sewed it myself. He was in a wagon (like lots of kids) with 6 Barbie dolls in gowns (representing 6 wives of Henry the 8th, I'm a huge history nerd) and a gold chalice. His costume was full coverage ( I have photos) velvet robe, white tunic, white stockings, blue hat.\n\nI am baffled as to why he was not allowed to compete, why this was considered inappropriate, and how I violated any rules. Any insight parents? \n\n\nUpdate: so I emailed the judges board and asked them for clarification so we didn't make the same mistake next year. They said \n\n\" We found the use of the golden wine glass as a costume prop (alcohol paraphernalia) to be inappropriate for the fall festival. As it is an alcohol and drug free event we could not allow a costume promoting alcohol consumption to compete.\"\n\nSo (as a few people guessed) it WAS the chalice. Which was empty, and I would have taken away and put in my diaper bag if they'd ask and I still don't fully see it as a reason for disqualification as it was removable but....oh well!  ",

She will let the garbage can build up and it smells and I have to constantly remind her to dump it. I told her she needs to dump it daily when its that time of the month. Sometimes she is to embarrassed to tell me she needs stuff and she uses toilet paper and bleeds out all over everything and ruins her underwear. I am her father and she lives with me and my wife who is not her mother. So I think she is uncomfortable with he whole period thing. I tried telling her its no big deal and that it is natural and normal and if she needs anything to tell me and I can get her that stuff. She seems to make it really awkward and tonight when I found the tampon in the shower sitting on the shelf next to the shampoo I was mortified. I explained to her a father doesn't want to see that.  And it is extremely unsanitary and disrespectful to do that. And then I made her scrub and bleach the shower. I don't know if I am handling this right or handled this situation right. But does anyone have any advice to help me make it though this awkwardness?",

I have been to talk to his principle twice but nothing has stopped it.\n\nIt all started after a class project about slavery. His US history class was divided into slavery advocates, and abolitionists. They were given a week to research and present a case for or against slavery.\n\nMy son was chosen on the pro slavery camp. Like every assignment he took this one seriously. He worked very hard, he argued his case historically like he was actually a slave owner of the time. \n\nBecause of his hard work, he was the only person in his class to receive an A+ on the assignment.\n\nAfterwards, kids in his class started calling him racist, and KKK. It spread to others in his middle school, and he even got jumped by a couple of other boys.\n\nI think this assignment was reckless in today's political climate. It was also reckless to put on of the only little white kids in class on the pro slavery team, random or not.\n\nMy husband and I are thinking of transferring him to a different school because of this. What should we do?\n\nEdit: I dont think it matters, but I have the notes from his presentation/debate, so if anyone wants to know what he said I can tell you. ",

My husband and I are both 23 for reference if anyone is curious. \n\nSo, my husband and I have agreed on mostly everything in our marriage and parenting even from such a young age of having our daughter, except for this. So my husband took a lot of road trips when he was younger because his parents were divorced and he had to travel a long way in between houses to see them. He always told me how his dad almost NEVER stopped for any reason, such as bathroom breaks and food (they would just pack food) and this has become a problem in our parenting differences. \n\nWe go on a lot of road trips with our daughter now to visit both of his parents, and the traits his parents pushed on him have now started to effect his parenting on his own daughter. \n\nOur daughter is fully potty trained now, but she, like I, has a tiny bladder and can\u2019t go very long between stops. Doctor says she\u2019s completely healthy, and I know that when she asks to stop she genuinely does need to. As you can tell, the problem with this is that my husband thinks she should be able to hold her bladder and go the 3-4 hours during drives without asking to stop and that this will help her train her bladder. Most of the time, when she asks to stop, he outright refuses. \n\nMy thoughts: stop whenever she needs to go and that making her hold it long term will not only physically harm her, but probably emotional too. \n\nHow can I get my husband to see how harmful this is for our daughter?\n\n",

Just stories of me when I was a stupid kid, fathrely advice, pictures of us, stuff like that. \n \nI recorded myself reading the Harry Potter books.  \n\nI bought 16 years worth of Christmas/birthday cards and presents.  They're all at my bank and will be released for her when it's the time.\n\nI bought 3 bottles of wine that were bottled on her birthday. One for her graduation, one for her wedding,and one for when she has her first child. \n\nI'd like to thank all that commented or pm'd me.

She'll never be without.  Please, if you want to do something kind then donate your time at your local shelter to help those less fortunate feel like they are loved, or to any cancer research charty so we can stop this from happening to other families. \n\nWe love you all and please let your hearts be open to nothing but love.",

            "selftext": "I\u2019m from South Africa (but live and work in the US). My father is white, and my mother is mixed (half black/half white). Despite my mother being half black, she\u2019s very pale and her facial features are predominantly European, so she passes off as being white. She took after her mother, my wonderful grandmother.\n\nMy parents got together in the 80s, when Apartheid was still going on. In order to make things easier for themselves, they passed my mum off as fully white (since she looked it) and it worked. There were no social repercussions for them. However, that lie was blown wide open when I was born.\n\nMy parents are intelligent people, but I do wonder where those brains went when they conceived me. On a genetic level, I\u2019m mostly white (since my dad is fully white and my mum is half white) and they naively thought that would automatically translate to my appearance. Something that was exacerbated by my mother\u2019s appearance.  I can\u2019t believe they were so na\u00efve and didn\u2019t take into consideration how complex human DNA is. How many variables it contains.\n\nI was born with brown skin \u2013 I look more black than white. It was something they weren\u2019t expecting. They thought I\u2019d turn out like my mother. In order to avoid the shame, they gave me to my grandmother (my mother\u2019s mum) as a baby and she raised me all the way to adulthood. \n\nGod bless her late soul. She\u2019s the woman I consider to be my real mother. I could never repay the love and care she showed me. The bravest human being I have ever known (she was white and you can't imagine the amount of crap she got).\n\nMy parents continued to play the genetic lottery by having two more kids after me. I guess in their eyes, they won. I have two younger brothers, who have pale skin and European features like my mum. They kept them. As far people in their social circles know, my parents have two children, not three. \n\nMy parents and two younger brothers would visit me and my grandmother sometimes. I hated it when they visited. Made me feel terribly ashamed. And I get the feeling they felt the same \u2013 that they did it not out of a need to see me, but some kind of moral obligation. I\u2019m 35 now but I still shudder when I think about those days. My own parents and siblings are absolute strangers to me \u2013 my relationship with them is non-existent. \n\nApartheid ended when I was a little boy, but they didn't come back to get me. I guess they were so deep in the lie, they couldn't go back.\n\nI have three kids - two boys and one girl. Triplets. They are my world. In August, I was on vacation with my family. We were back in South Africa. My parents found out from my uncle (dad's youngest brother - the only person from that side of the family I have a relationship with) that I was back in the country. They have never met my wife and kids. I met them on my own. I showed them photographs of my family on my phone. They said they wanted to meet the kids but I flat out refused.\n\nI told them the truth \u2013 I don\u2019t trust them being around my children at all. I just don\u2019t. My mother shed tears, saying she was sorry for everything that happened and that if she could wind back the clock, she would do things differently. My dad also said he was sorry, but he said I\u2019m being a bad father by depriving the kids of grandparents. I felt like smacking him in the mouth when he said that \u2013 but I held my tongue. My wife told me in that moment, I should have told him everything I have always felt about them.\n\nMy family and I are back in the US now. But I keep getting emails, especially from my dad, asking me to reconsider. One of the things that heightens my apprehension is the fact my kids are multi-hued and I don't want any semblance of racism/colourism being introduced to them. They will encounter enough of that bullshit as they grow up and make their own way in life. I don't think my parents are capable of doing that in an overly aggressive sense . . . but in an ignorant, \"don't know the impact of their words\" way? Possible.\n\nI'd appreciate any advice on the situation.\n\nThanks\n  \n\n",

We had originally agreed to not allow our son (or daughter) to play tackle football.\n\nOur son asked again when he started middle school and after much consideration, we decided to allow it. He was beaming after the first game and we knew that he loved being out there. We continued to allow it despite our fears because it made our boy so happy and we saw him become more confident. \n\nIt may be important to note that our son is very small for his age. He is in 7th grade and is just under 4'7 and weighs around 74 pounds or so. He plays bigger than he is and gives it 110 percent. This has resulted in some injuries, one of which was a concussion that happened about a month ago. Our son is back into action and seems to be fully recovered.\n\nWith new information coming out about CTE seemingly every month, my wife has become more concerned. The news that Aaron Hernandez's brain was similar to that of a 60 year old man with CTE seemed to be the last straw and she said that she doesn't want him playing football next year. I see her concerns, but I don't want to stop my son from doing something he clearly loves. He wrestles and plays baseball as well, but football is his passion. He will be crushed if forced to give it up.\n\nAm I being unreasonable for wanting this to be his decision? Should I just accept that this is too risky and talk to my son about it? My wife said he can continue this year because he made a commitment to his team, but doesn't want him playing next year. He'll be 13 by then. Any tips on how to tell a 13 year old that we are making him give up the sport that he loves most? ",

            "selftext": "My son has very low functioning autism - he will permanently have the mental capacity of a baby, he hits and kicks frequently, will never be verbal or toilet trained. \n\nI am the worst person alive but the idea of spending the next 15 years *minimum* like this feel like a prison sentence and I want to find my options to turn his care over to the state. \n\nI'm starting to feel really angry at all these \"disabilities rights advocates\" who pushed for the closure of care facilities and say that anything other than these kids being raised at home is inhumane. I'll sound like a brat, but you know what is inhumane? Expecting my husband and I to be the 24/7 caregivers of someone with extreme special needs. We're not doctors or nurses! We don't get to do out shift and go home so we don't burn out. We don't get vacation leave - all things that care facility employers WOULD get. It's just asking far too much and we are burned out. I also don't think it is fair to make his 6 year old sister live this kind of life either - she's been acting out a lot at school lately and everyone is pretty sure she is doing it for attention. He's started hitting her a couple of times. She always says it's 'not fair' she has to live with him, and I feel terrible for saying this, but my husband and I agree it is not fair this happened to us. \n\nI know people will say stuff like 'he is your child, how can you want to give him away'. But it's easy to say that when he is a cute looking 3 year old and small enough to be picked up, but one of these days, he is going to be a 20 year old man. My husband is 6'5. I am 5'9. Men on both sides of the family are tall. He will likely be tall.  I won't be able to care for him then anyway. I won't be able to physically pick him up, when he hits me, he'll be capable of knocking me out, I won't be able to lift him into a bed or bath anymore. I feel like putting him into care will be inevitable anyway. What about when he is 13 and hits his sister? Should my daughter have to live with violence in her own home? I sound like a dick, but I figure it will happen one day anyway, so why can't 'one day' be today anyway? People say 'but homes are not as nice', and to be honest.....I kinda don't care? He won't know where he is anyway, and our home is becoming hell with him in it and I feel like my daughter deserves better and we deserve to be free too. Free of the endless tantrums, breaking everything, kicking, punching, biting, the lingering smell of pee and shit in the air because he is incontinent. \n\nI sound horrible but I don't love him and only care for him because it is my obligation to do so. I can't bond with him at all - he won't even look us in the eyes, he hits me and kicks me and while it know it is not his fault, it is pretty hard to bind with someone who does nothing but kick, bite and hit you. My husband confessed to me that while he'd never hurt him, he'd feel nothing but relief if he died suddenly. I feel the same - it would be like a weight off our shoulders. \n\nThis is really selfish to say, but I miss my job. I want to go back to my job. I studied for *years* to have my job and it made me fulfilled and happy. Giving up my career to basically wrangle tis child around will send me into depression. I wasn't even cut out being a SAHM to our daughter and went back to work early so I can't do this for another 15 years. My husband can't stay at home because he earns more than I do and we are reliant on his income. Neither of us want to give up our lives to care for him full time and it angers me we are expected to. All we get is a lousy 3 days a year of respite care which is coming up soon - right for my daughter's birthday. We've asked about a care facility for him but have been told the waiting lists are 10 years longer and they prefer kids to be at home until they are 18 because it's 'nicer' and most places are for adults. The one way we can basically surrender him without being charged with 'child abandonment' is to drop him off at respite and refuse to pick him up - then they are forced to find a solution for him. \n\nHas anyone been in this situation and can give me some wisdom and advice or even just a 'you are not alone'?

            "selftext": "I have a 4 year old and 2 year old twins - and I do not have PPD. I am simply someone who realises she made decisions that were wrong for her and there is no way to take them back without completely fucking up her kids. I was starting to realise I just didn't have baby blues and *regretted* having my oldest when I got pregnant with the twins while on the waiting list for an IUD. I wish deeply now that I didn't tell my husband and just had the abortion I wanted. I think my feelings would be more manageable with one child and not three. \n\nI would do absolutely anything to go back 8 years and find a different husband and not have my children. Don't get me wrong, I love my husband dearly, he is the most wonderful person, it was just that him wanting children changed my mind about not wanting them so now I wish I met someone else. I feel like I've ruined my life. There are some great moments, but I just feel like they don't wipe out all the tough moments, iykwim. \n\nI was pretty much the posterchild for the category of woman most likely to regret having children - I was over 35 but under 40 when my first child was born, with higher education (I have a two BAs and a masters degree), well travelled, and used to having a decent amount of disposable income to spend on herself. According to my therapist, not even teenage mothers regret becoming parents as much as women like me. We get used to our freedom and money and great sex lives and it turns our worlds upside down to lose it. \n\nUp until about age 32, I told anyone who would listen that I was never having children. But then I met my husband who did want children and the combination of 'your biological clock is * t i c k i n g *' hormones and not wanting to lose him made me change my mind and even like the idea of having children. It didn't help that I saw so many happy young families on Facebook (friends/family who have since admitted it was mostly all lies) and everyone told me I'd never regret it. \n\nBut I do.\n\nI thought I was ready to change my life and become a parent, but I wasn't.  \n\nEvery single time I see a childfree person, I feel like they are living what was meant to be *my* life and I want it back. \n\nI wasn't ready to give up travelling. I want to break down and sob with jealousy every time I see someone posting pictures from a holiday that doesn't involve 'family friendly' activities and airport meltdowns. I can't stand taking holidays with my kids - they are not a holiday at all. I didn't get to tick everything off my travel bucketlist before they were born and some of those things are things I will be too old for when they are grown, so will just never happen in my life. I know this is selfish, but travel was my passion and I don't feel like myself without it. \n\nI want to cry with jealousy every time someone gives me a dirty look while my 2.5 year old has a meltdown in the supermarket - because that used to be me, but now I am the one stuck dealing with this kid having a fit. This will sound contradictory but I love my children dearly but I actually don't enjoy looking after them? I love them, but I hate being stuck at home with the twins all the time (childcare for 2 is unaffordable) and and 2 days a week, I have my oldest child too, because pre schooling is part time until they are 5 and that doesn't happen until next year. I feel like I'm trapped in a prison cell - except my cell is a middle class apartment with three small children in it. \n\nI want to go back to University and change my career - but I can't really afford to do that because I have to care for my kids and when they got to school, need to contribute more financially and can't just throw that in to study. I am painfully aware that if I was still childfree, I *could* change my life more. \n\nI still have a good relationship with my husband, but I miss the relationship we *used* to have with a much better sex life, fun vacations together, going out more often, talking far more often about things that are not kids schedules and diapers. He is great with them and one of the fulfilling things about having had my kids is seeing him with them. He's an amazing Dad and he's so cute with them, but I'd rather see him holding niece and nephews than have these kids we are responsible for. I just want some time to sleep in. I also miss my old body - no matter how many times he assures me I am still sexy to him, I miss the fit body I had when we met and how I looked in lingerie. And the lack of disposable income hurts in the sense that I don't get my hair done as much, I don't get my nails done anymore, I don't dress as nicely. I feel frumpy, even though I try not to be. \n\nI feel like I'd just lost so much of myself - I'm isolated from my old pre-kids friends and everyone's advice is to to make 'mom-friends'. The thing is, and this will sound hideously arrogant, I can't stand my 'mom-friends'. I feel like the majority of these women are people that have joint 'the motherhood cult' and want to do nothing but talk about their kids, while I am craving adult interaction and conversations about things *not* kids. I feel like most of them are utterly incapable of holding an intelligent or interesting conversation. And i find they are very into a different style of parenting - putting their kids in fancy clothes and putting tons of public pictures on Instagram and that's just not me. Unless they are in a wedding, having their christmas pictures taken, or it's their birthday, no child of mine will ever wear an outfit worth more than $100. They don't want the kids being kids and ruining how they look by playing them. I put my kids in $15 outfits from H&amp;M tell them to go wild. I dress in 'better' clothes but because I prefer to buy a few good quality mix/match pieces - I'm not outgrowing/destroying clothes all the time. These women judge me for putting myself in better clothes than my kids and not loving them as much, but I don't feel comfortable putting tons of pics of them online for strangers to see and my kids are not neglected or poorly dressed, I just don't see the point of putting them in expensive clothes when they outgrow stuff so quickly. I'm not the 'mommy blogger' type, I just feel like becoming a mother put me in this culture I don't belong in which is really making me regret it. \n\nI feel like I have no intelligence anymore - I find doing children's activities with the intellectually demeaning and I would be far more fulfilled doing a PHD, reading a book, watching a documentary than fucking finger painting or pretending to play tea-parties. I want my old self back, not this \"dumb\" woman. \n\nI think we are suffering a lot as well from a lack of family support nearby - we both moved a long way from our small home towns because we have careers which are big city based and there are not a lot of options in our home towns. We have to do it all on our own and it is just making me so burned out. He is even here in a different country because his country has major social/economic problems, so he stayed and became a permanent resident after his degree was finished. My parents would happily baby sit and so would his mother (father has passed away), but they just can't very often. I feel like i never get much time away from my kids and its burning me out. It doesn't help that I am in introvert and two of my kids in particular are very extroverted and demanding of my attention and having them around all the time exhausts and frustrates me to tears.  \n\nI hate poorly behaved kids and no matter how hard I try, one of the twins is just super defiant and is just by nature this poorly behaved child and I'm terrified I am loving this child less than the others because I find myself.....particularly wishing this child out of my life more than the others. I love all my children, but I find myself disliking his child far more than the other two, which is a horrible, horrible thought but I can't help it because they are just so much more difficult than the others and much more unpleasant to be around. \n\nOh and I just want to sleep in. I'm sick of being tired. And it's making me look old. And I miss the days where I always had nicely done makeup. Now I just look tired and old. \n\nSo all this = someone who regrets kids. I just don't feel like having kids was worth it. The occasional nice moments you get with kids doesn't make up for all the sacrifices, all the drudgery, all the literal ass wiping, the lack of sleep, lack of time with my husband, lack of sex, having to deal with them all the time, the career suicide, everything. It just wasn't worth it. I love them, but would take a chance to have a do-over in a heartbeat. \n\nBut I am aware of the fact that I chose to have these kids and it is not a decision I could take back no matter how much I wish I could. I feel like people who regret having their kids are treated like absolute monsters and like they are not even human and that 'I feel sorry for the kids but not them, fuck them'. Ok. That's fair. But I'm not such a terrible person that I don't care. I feel **awful** for feeling this way. I wish I could be one of those mothers who just *loves* being a parent and is always saying how amazing their life is and blah blah blah but I'm not.\n\nSo now I have been able to make peace with the fact that this is how I feel, how can I try and be as happy as possible even though I still have many more years of child raising ahead of me and how can I be the best possible parent to my kids despite feeling the way I do? Just because I want a do-over and wish I never had them doesn't mean I wish them unhappiness and I don't want them to realise how I feel or feel unwanted or have ruined childhoods because I couldn't suck it up properly and save them from being emotionally harmed. \n\nHelp me, reddit.

I've heard her yell at the kids (almost 8 and 3), which bothers me, but thought that was the end of it.\n\nLast night, while my daughter (8) was in the bath, she started asking me questions about my mom... First, random ones, like \"what color was her hair?\" Then she asked me, \"did she ever slap you?\" I was taken aback by that, and answered honestly, yes, and asked if she'd slapped her. I'd NEVER mentioned it to my daughter, as I wanted her to have a positive relationship with her grandmother, and really thought my mother would never go there with my own kids... But apparently that's not the case.\n\nI am feeling really disturbed by this. My husband and I have already asked her to help with a few upcoming commitments, and I'm honestly wondering whether we can trust her at all at this point. How should I address this?

Sorry to anyone who posted in the other thread***\n\nTitle says it.\n\nMy (36M) Wife (30F) died yesterday morning at 0421GMT after life-support (inotropes) was withdrawn. She had multi-organ failure after a loop of bowel became twisted. *I was by her side all the time. I felt her heart stop. For 3-hours I sobbed and told her again and again how much I love her and how much our daughter loves her. I really hope that those were the last words she heard*\n\nWhen I finally got home, our Daughter (2.84F) was just getting up for Nursery. She ran into my room, climbed into my bed and we snuggled to watch 'Bing'.\n\nI have my wife's wedding and engagement rings on my finger. Daughter saw these and said, *\"Mummy's earrings. I love my Mummy. I love Mummy and Daddy\"*. I quietly wept as I told her how very much her Mummy loved her, more than anything ever.\n\nI'm numb inside, and finally understand that expression. Currently alternating stoic resolve with random episodes of sobbing in a most unmanly and undignified fashion. \n\nI know the administrative steps I need to take in order to bury my wife. I managed to get her phone, laptop and bank account passwords. Likewise I know what bills are in her name and who to contact.\n\nSince yesterday I have spoken to the coroner and my wife has had her postmortem. I have to wait until Monday to register her death, in order to allow me to arrange a funeral. Which is most frustrating.\n\nExcept one thing; How the frak do I approach the topic with our Daughter. She already knows Mummy has been very poorly in Hospital, using terms she can understand (hurty tummy, a bad bad one).\n\nI've informed Nursery about Mummy, and will have a long and detailed chat with them within the next couple days. I'm planning to keep her daily routines as normal as possible. Rightly or wrongly, I am keen to try and minimise disruption and hopefully not to scar her emotionally too much. I recall reading somewhere that the routine will help Daughter to get through the coming months.\n\nBut how do you explain to a little infant that she won't ever see Mummy again?\n\nPlease help me. I don't know what to do.\n\nTell me how to do this in a way that won't hurt our Daughter too much. How can I also fulfil my last promise to ensure she knows just how much her Mummy adored her.\n\nHow the hell can I raise her on my own?\n\nYesterday I gave my daughter a soft toy dog (Big Doggy) which my wife had slept with every night from childhood. I promised to give it to our daughter. Unfortunately I could not hide my grief and was sobbing when I told my daughter how much mummy loved her, and wanted her have the toy for daughter to look after for her. I slept with my daughter last night, and will do tonight also. My daughter insisted on snuggling with Big Doggy and a rabbit toy which she won't sleep without. I had promised to tell daughter how much mummy loved her, each and every night...so I did.\n\nMy daughter knows something really bad has happened. I have never cried in front of her before. She has never seen me sobbing or wailing. When I presented daughter with Big Doggy, she stood completely still and stared at me with an expression I have never seen before. She seemed to understand that there is an awful awful thing she doesn't know about. I have close relatives who have come to stay, my daughter is feeling shy but playing with her uncle happily. \n\nI have an Aunt who is a Child Psychiatrist, thankfully I am very close to this person and trust her implicitly. She is speaking to some colleagues to come up with a few different ideas. \n\n**Ultimately it must be myself, alone, who will explain to daughter that mummy has gone** There was some really good advice in the replies of my OP. I will avoid associating tummy aches with death. I will try to make sure she knows mummy can't come back, ever. I know that she can't understand. It truly breaks my heart that she won't really remember mummy. We have thousands of photos and videos that my wife and I took. I need to find a way to archive these safely so I can show my daughter one day.\n\n*goodbye Fluffy, you saved me, I had given up completely, then you came along.*\n\nTLDR: Need help in telling 2.84F Daughter that Mummy is dead.\n\n**TLDRTLDR: Wife dead, infant daughter. Wat do?**\n\nEdit: 2329 GMT\n\nSorry to everyone who doesn't have a reply yet. I am definitely going to comment and thank each of you. I feel so alone and so scared. I have no idea how i can do this without my wife. I can't even manage a good plait, which ny wife always did. My daughter loves the Frozen song \"let it go\". Thats what she calls it, \"i want let it go hair\". Then she goes around saying \"I'm Ella...Ella...Ella\". Which is supposed to be Elsa, which she thinks is the name of the Ice Queen-Person-Whoever. She always wanted let it go hair every moment of every day, for months.  Until a week or so ago, when she started saying \"I want Mummy ponytail\". And now won't wear her hair any other way. \n\nI just keep crying whenever I read another comment below. Each and every one of you has made me feel less alone. Random internet strangers showing another stranger such compassion. It makes me feel like the world isn't quite as cold.\n\nI'm taking on board all of your suggestions and anecdotes. I appreciate all the messages of support \n\nI have to try to sleep now. Dr gave me valium to help. Box of extra soft tissues with balm. Daughter currently cuddling my foot.\n\nI am going to reply to everyone. It will take time because I'm also organising the funeral and trying to get the death registered. Today was spent chasing the coroner, seeing th dr, finding a funeral director, phoning specialist bereavement therapists. I've also contacted my paediatric home visitor to ask for help, she is looking for a play therapist. There's been a stream of relatives and friends who came by this evening. I also went into nursery to speak to the manager. \n\nTurns out dying in a burocracy like the UK causes a vast amount of paperwork. \n\n*i really want to thank each person who has commented or looked at this post. I will keep replying until I've done everyone*\n\n\nEdit2; 1100gmt 19.08.17\n\nBack online. Will be checking and replying all day as time permits me. \n\nKeep on commenting. I'm going to be reading everything. \n\nThanks for all the support and well-wishes ",

            "selftext": "Hello, Reddit\n\nMy daughter is getting married next year, to a wonderful, funny, charming, strong, intelligent young man. I have never seen her this happy in life (she had a lot of issues with depression and mental health in general as a teen). As a mother, it\u2019s an absolute joy to see her like this. However, my husband has a problem with his future son in law, and it is all because he\u2019s black.\n\nMy future SIL is from Kenya. His parents died when he was 7, and he spent 3 years living on the streets, alone. Words can\u2019t imagine the things he experienced at a such a young, tender age. He has remarkable strength. He was eventually taken into an orphanage \u2013 managed to work very hard at school and stood out among his peers, to the point of being offered a scholarship at an American university. That\u2019s where he met my daughter. They started dating when they were 20.\n\nMy husband immediately disapproved. I will be completely honest with you \u2013 initially, I was reserved and maybe even apprehensive about it. But after I got to know him, I fell head over heels for him. He\u2019s an absolute keeper. However, even after meeting him, my husband still disapproves. He admits the fianc\u00e9 is a good man, and goes on to say he is not racist \u2013 but he thinks \u201cmixed unions create many complications.\u201d I called BS on that but he is still sticking to the party line.\n\nLast week, my daughter blew up at him. She was visiting on her own and my dad pulled up a story about a mixed child who had identity issues and told her \u201cyou may do that to your own children.\u201d \n\nMy husband has never been this direct in his disapproval. I was shocked. And disgusted (I sure as hell let him know). My daughter blew up at him, told him she didn\u2019t want him anywhere near the wedding and any future grandchildren. My husband said he\u2019d welcome it.\n\n\nI\u2019m completely on my daughter\u2019s side. There is no grey area on that. Over the last few days, we\u2019ve had tense arguments over the subject. He\u2019s a stubborn old crow and says he is doing what he is because he loves our daughter. I\u2019ve been speaking to my daughter and she says she really doesn\u2019t want anything more to do with her father.\n\nIf there is anyone who has experienced something similar or who could offer any helpful advice, I would appreciate it.\n\nThanks\n",

            "selftext": "I'm more of an attachment parent type, while my husband  is more or less authoritative.  I don't think either of us really understood how much we were not on the same page until we had our first, because there are a lot of things we did agree on when we talked pre-child.  \n\nThis has played out to the point that my husband doesn't want to have more children unless we get on the same page...meaning I do things his way. \n\nHere are the major issues we've had so far: (on mobile, please forgive any formatting issues)\n\n1.  I started cosleeping with our child at 3 months.  I didn't do this because I wanted to, I did it because I was so fucking tired and I had fallen asleep more than once while nursing the baby on the couch, which is so dangerous.  Baby wouldn't (and still won't) take a bottle and I'm a SAHM, so I have all the night duties.  Cosleeping was a godsend for me. I'm not overly tired anymore, I can function well during the day, and I'm not super grumpy anymore.  The only problem is, our child refuses to sleep without me.  He was kind of like this from birth (wouldn't nap unless held), but cosleeping at night made it worse.  The only way I can see to break this is if I give up sleeping for weeks to get him to transition, the CIO method, or, my preference, wait until he's old enough to understand the idea of sleeping alone and phase him out then.  The thought of giving up sleep makes me want to cry.  I get that CIO works for some people, and that's great, but I literally cannot do it.  It guts me to even think about it, I can't handle hearing that type of cry, and studies have linked it with possible increased risk of anxiety issues later in life.  I know that at his age, this may not be the case, especially using the graduated method, but even the chance scares me and I would have mom guilt forever if he did end up having any kind of anxiety later on.  Husband resents me over this and wanted to do CIO from the time our son was 1 month. \n\n2. I was an early childhood health and safety specialist before I had my son, and I'm an early childhood dietitian.  My husband gets so frustrated when I tell him he can't do something that I know poses a risk to our child.  No, he can't sleep on the couch with our infant.  No, he can't give a baby a small ice chip, it's a choking hazard.  No, he shouldn't be carrying a baby under 6mo around in the midday sun for an extended period of time with no sun protection.  My husband says I \"steal the joy\" out of parenting for him when I protest his decisions like this, and he doesn't think any of it is a bad idea or dangerous. \n\n3.  I tended to pick my son up and comfort him any time he cried for the first 4-6 months.  After 6 months, I did it a little less.  Now, if I'm washing dishes and son is fussing (and doesn't have an immediate need), he's got to wait until I'm done.  I feel like I've taken a developmental approach to this...fostering attachment and feelings of safety for a small baby who doesn't know what's going on around them, to now letting up a bit as he gets older and more aware.  My husband never liked this and thought I should let our son fuss a little before I pick him up so as not to coddle him.  And he told me, just two weeks ago, that I should be letting our some cry more because it strengthens his vocal chords?? Wtf.  \n\n\nThese are our main issues so far.  I have no idea what the future holds for the toddler years, but I'm guessing it will be me taking a softer approach than my husband and being raked over the coals for it. \n\nAny of you deal with parenting differences like this?  I don't want to put my kid before my marriage to the point that it weakens our marriage, but I can't see much wiggle room for compromise right now given that most of the things we disagree on involve safety or me losing my precious, precious sleep.  Any advice or perspective would be welcome.  Also, I'm sorry you're only getting my point of view here. \n\nEdit:  I'm getting a lot of feed back that I'm being inconsistent about cosleeping and my other safety concerns.  I'm going to answer that here to avoid having to repeat my answers in the comments.  There are two types of cosleeping research: 1. Aggregate studies that combine all instances of accidentally falling asleep on the couch with the baby, alcohol and substance abuse, additional children in the bed with the baby, excess pillows and plush bedding, etc. 2. Studies that only include safe bedsharing (BFing mother, no alcohol/substance abuse, firm mattress, no blankets or non-plush blankets pulled only waist high and tucked under the parent, no excess pillows or items that may be rolled into causing smothering).  Studies like #1 show an increased risk of sleep related death.  Studies like #2 show no increased risk of sleep related death and even correlate with a lowered incidence of SIDS.  Furthermore, my body does not move a muscle when I sleep with anyone else in the bed, especially my child.  My hands don't even move.  So not only statistically am I not being inconsistent, anecdotally I know my own sleep habits and I'm not putting my child at risk.  When he was sleeping on his own and I had to get up in the night to feed, I was falling asleep with him on the couch.  That is definitely unsafe.  \n\nEdit 2:  Apparently this post is pretty controversial and people are getting the idea that I don't want to compromise at all with my husband.  First, if any of you have posted on Reddit asking for advice, you know that putting all the details of a relationship in one post is impossible and no one would read it all.  So a lot of stuff has been left out.  If you want to know something specific, please ask instead of assuming that I'm ball busting my husband at every turn.  I do try to compromise, but when you're the caretaker of the child 99% of the time and your husband is only home to see him an hour at night and four hours on the weekend (on average), you tend to be the one making all the decisions.  \n\nA couple ways I have compromised:  \nWe were gifted cloth diapers, but my husband hates them, so I buy disposables. He uses the disposables, I use the cloth.  He didn't like the baby led weaning approach to introducing solids, so I switched to spoon fed.  I REALLY didn't want to circumcise him, but my husband felt strongly that we should and I gave in.  This is not a comprehensive list, just examples. \n\nEdit 3: Also, I appreciate helpful discussion, even if I don't agree with what's being said to me.  I still like getting the perspectives of others and I have not downvoted anyone.  If you don't like my attempts to continue this type of discussion in the comments, then by all means, continue downvoting me.  \n\nTL;DR - Husband and I disagree on things like cosleeping, infant safety, and when to respond to crying. Given the nature of our circumstance, I don't see how we can compromise or work through it, but it's hurting our marriage.  ",

After a couple play dates she asked me if I wanted to meet her other mom friends- I mean sure! Why not! So I did. \n\nSo I joined this group of 3 moms. We had a total of 8 kids who all got along really really well. The first time I met them, we went to this gorgeous park, they had packed a picnic, it was really nice. The second time we met it was a girl's house and we also had a great time. The third time we met... well I said I couldn't go, because it was really far for me and I mean... we had met already twice in 4 days. \n\nThat's when one of the moms reached out to me and asked me what my \"mom friends goal\" was and how I was going to get there. I was pretty perplexed at that question, what does it even mean? So I asked her what did she mean and she said that to put it simple, they had criteria for their mom friends and that they just wanted to make sure I was on the same page. \n\nOk. \n\nSo apparently one of their criteria is meeting *at least* three times a week for play dates and chit-chats. They say it apparently makes their friendship strong and that it makes the kids bound more. They've explained that basically it's what \"separates us from just being play ground moms.\" I replied that it was nearly impossible for me to meet them three times a week and that it was very unrealistic for me. \n\nWell, one of them actually got mad at me and asked me \"why I had joined their group if I wasn't willing to commit.\" After trying to explain that I AM always looking for new moms/ parents for play dates I am NOT looking for a serious commitment from those moms/parents. That's pretty much the last times I heard of them. \n\nMy husband just got back to town (he was away for a week while all this went down) and he laughed thinking I was kidding, but nope. Apparently mom groups are a thing now, and it's a very serious commitment. ",

            "selftext": "I was at the public pool a couple weeks ago. I only had my 5 and 7 yr olds with me. My 7 yr old is an ok swimmer and was swimming near me, to the right of me where it was deeper. He was also going on the water slide. This is the local public pool near our house. We live in a nice and quiet suburb with very little crime. But it is a burb of a major metropolitan area and is attracting more and more issues in recent times. Our suburb has near 90K people in it. We are very close to many other suburbs as in, it would be easy for even a child to bike between the towns as there is no between the towns. You just drive up the road and the town becomes the other one.\n\nOK..my 5 yr old, who is small for her age, quite petite, and not a good swimmer yet but working on it and in swim lessons, was in front of me by about 15 feet. We were in the little child section where it has zero entry and then gets as deep as 2 feet. She was playing with a couple little friends who were girls. \n\nI see her speaking with an adult woman and think nothing of it. Then I see the adult woman grab her by the arm, above the elbow and try to drag her out of the pool. I scream and say \"that is my child! Let go!\" and I was running through the water, which is slow to run in. And I grab my daughter back before the woman can get completely out of the pool. My heart was pounding and I grabbed my daughter and took her away from the woman and looked around quickly for my son and made sure he was safe. The woman took off. She was just gone. No one seemed alarmed and went on with their business so I collected my children and left the pool. After home and cleaned up, I went back to the pool and spoke to the employees. They told me \"the mom was just trying to help the little girl.\" I repeated back to them that she was NOT the mom, I am, and if she was trying to help, why did she take off? And why MY little girl? There were several girls there. I was at least near by. I know for sure that the other moms were further away, sitting on chairs visiting with each other. My daughter told me that the woman approached her and asked her where her mom was, not her parents, but her mom specifically. And my daughter told her she did not know. And that was when the woman grabbed her. \n\nNow I am scared to go back to the pool, or anywhere in public where I cannot stand right next to each of my children and watch them very closely. And the staff at the pool just kept saying \"this is a safe town, nothing ever happens here, I am sure she was just trying to help the little girl.\" \n\nIt has been a couple more weeks now. I bought the kids new ipads so they are not asking to go to the pool anymore. I feel like a rotten parent for letting them melt away on ipads, but I would rather them do that than one of the children end up missing. I am still upset over the whole thing.\n\nedited to add: It has been suggested I move this to the original post, but I put this in the comments. I did report it. And there was video. But because of the angle, the picture was not very good, and from what they could see, no one recognized her. We do live in the south just hours from the border. And the city we are a suburb of does have issues with trafficking, although I do not think I have heard any specific child abduction stories in the news. The woman did not have children with her at the pool. And this was the baby section of the pool, which also happened to be the closest part of the pool to an exit that leads straight in to the parking lot. This pool is on the side of town where you can almost right away get on to a major freeway, within a couple minutes of leaving the pool parking lot. After what the woman did, she took off. Why was this woman messing around in the baby pool when she had no children, let alone small children? Even though my 5 yr old is small for her age, she was still one of the biggest people in the baby pool area. And she was in a group. And she showed no signs of distress to call for this woman singling her out and pulling her away from her friends.",

            "selftext": "**UPDATE:** Thank you for the immense support that was offered in the previous thread. I was encouraged to hear of so many parents who have gone through this and come out the other end and my heart goes out to all of the other parents struggling with the same thing. I think the key thing to keep in mind is that none of us know five year old kids who cry all day, so at *some point* this ***will*** stop.\n\n\nA lot of you were right, we got a prescription for ranitidine on a four-week trial which we can pick up tomorrow. Apparently, because of NICE guidelines, they try not to prescribe this stuff too much to babies but I cried in front of the doctor and this really is the last resort.\n\n\nTo solve the family problems my wife is going to take a two-week vacation to see her sister with our oldest daughter on Friday, over the weekend the baby and I are going to stay at a friend's empty cottage to see if it is something wrong with the house. We also contacted the fire department about carbon monoxide and they said that they can send someone to check the house out.\n\n\nMy boss is really understanding, his baby went through a similar thing, and I am taking two months for paternity leave so that my wife and daughter can move back into the house and I can stay with the baby at the cottage.\n\n\nOne big bit of progress was that we managed to somewhat calm her down and get her to sleep a lot easier by following the suggestions in the thread and taking her in the bath. I took her in the bathtub with me and held her in the warm water. Someone suggested a colic baby white noise track and I had the brainwave that maybe the sound of the water was what was calming her. The colic track made me wonder whether a heartbeat white noise would work, so in the bath I played a heartbeat and womb noises track quite loudly and she was calm for about half an hour and then fell asleep. I suspect that some of the commenters were right in their idea that the noise of her own crying was hurting her, so we ordered some ear defenders for her too. When she wakes up in the night we can usually soothe her within about 10 minutes back to sleep, but during the evening we ended up in the bathtub three times because it was making a difference. I'm blown away that it makes such a difference and I wish we had tried it sooner.\n\n\nI feel so guilty that we hadn't considered reflux earlier, we could have saved her so much discomfort, she has been crying literally her entire life. I feel like an awful parent, but hopefully, we can make a difference.\n\n\nMy question is, would it be harmful to her if I just had her in warm water for considerable periods of time throughout the day? If it calms her I'll gladly spend an hour at a time in the tub.\n\n\n(Without causing controversy or getting on a soapbox, I got a few messages about vaccine injury. I really appreciate the concern and empathy, but I really don't think that this has anything to do with vaccines. Even in the hypothetical case that it is, I think a baby who cries for a year straight but is protected from deadly disease is still a preferable to a baby who is calm but is at risk of disease, or a risk to other children who can't be vaccinated.)\n\n------\n\n\nThrowaway account, please help us.\n\nSince our second daughter was born three and a half months ago, she has not stopped crying. There's nothing wrong with her, the doctor suggests that it is a bad case of colic (edit: we have seen several doctors, all say no allergies, no broken bones, just back luck of colic). She sleeps for an hour at a time but then wakes up and starts screaming again. How can such a small baby make such horrible and loud sounds? At first I felt heartbroken that my child was in such discomfort but now I am numb to it.\n\n\nOur five-year-old daughter used to be a happy girl but she is constantly miserable because she never gets any peace or sleep at home and both her parents are zombies. She doesn't fully understand that the baby isn't doing this on purpose and tells us that she hates her and that she is a 'selfish brat' and while I try to explain that the baby doesn't mean it I can see why she is upset. She gets testy when it is time to leave school and her teachers have spoken to us several times about how she has changed and is no longer the happy girl she used to be. She sees the school's counsellor twice a week now. When she is in the house she will either want to play outside at the bottom of the garden. She won't even call the baby by her name, she calls her 'the selfish brat'. We have resorted to driving her half an hour to my brother's house so she can sleep there and she gets dropped off to school in the morning with her cousins. She says she hates coming home and wants to live with her uncle and aunt until we 'fix the baby or give her away'. Honestly, it is a terrible solution but I take it because it means that every other night I get an hour of peace in the car and our daughter gets a good night's sleep.\n\n\nMy wife is not suffering from depression, ~~she just also hates~~ (edit: hate is a strong word, I mean, she hates the situation) ~~the baby because she won't be quiet ever~~. First she felt guilty, now she just wants to give the baby up to care. We had the police called several times in the first few months because the neighbours thought we must be abusing the baby (they have since moved out at the end of their lease, and the property owner can't find a new tenant, that is how bad it is). The last time the police came, my wife outright said that if they suspected that we were abusing the child then they should take her and put her in care.\n\n\nOur marriage is also falling apart because we are both sleep deprived, on edge, tired, and eager to spend time away from the house just to get some quiet. She works from home and I work close by but I am spending late nights in the office just to avoid the noise. (edit: I take the baby all weekend, and am on night duty on Mon, Wed, Fri, but on Tuesdays and Thursdays I often go back to the office for an hour after dropping my daughter to my brother for an hour of quiet.)\n\n\nMy brother or his wife will occasionally come and babysit her while the three of us just get out of the house but my wife mostly wants to sleep, my daughter hates that she gets no attention from either of us, and that is understandable. No sitter in the local area will babysit for us and I can't blame them. The sitter who used to look after our oldest quit within a month of the baby being born because she couldn't take it.\n\n\nAt the start, my wife even pestered the hospital because she was sure that our baby had been switched at birth because our first was such an angel. About two or three times a week sits me down and tries to convince me that we should give the baby up for adoption and tells me that she loves me but if it comes to it thinks that it is better if we separate and she will take our daughter and leave me with the baby.\n\n\nI can not lie, I do not love the baby. Nor does my wife. I wish I were deaf.\n\n\nHas anyone been through this? Please offer some advice.\n\n\n**Edit: I am overwhelmed by the amount of support and thankful for all the suggestions. Thank you all so much. You're wonderful people. I can't keep up with replying to all the comments but am reading them all.**",

            "selftext": "I don't even know how to start this, I really need advice. Sorry if this is long. \n\nMy little girl just turned 2 about a month ago, she is sweet, smart, very energetic, and emotional (like her mommy lol me). Her vocabulary is great, she can speak in full, short sentences and I am very fortunate to be able to communicate fairly well with her. My 4.5 y/o nephew has a speech delay, so I know it can be much more difficult communicating. \n\nThat being said, since she was first born, my husband has had a lot of trouble with crying. When our little one was very very little, she didn't just cry, she banshee screamed any time she was upset, dirty, hungry, screamed, etc. It was literal torture for both of us during the newborn/infant stage and I even ended up with severe postpartum anxiety and depression. To some extent, I think my husband did as well which was extra difficult because he was laid off 2 months after she was born. The banshee screaming would send him into an instant rage, so I became the primary parent to care for her, and he would take care of things around the house. \n\nAbout 8 months ago, my husband took a contract job out in the field which requires a LOT of travel. He is gone more often than not, but it has improved his mood and our financial standing, so we're grateful. In the time he's home, he has commended me multiple times on how well our daughter communicates, how receptive she is to my interactions with her and the schedule we've implemented. \n\nHowever, in the past couple months he's been home a little more and noticed her incessant whining and has said she need to behave and be spanked more for defiance or the earth-shattering tantrums. I know spanking is contentious on Reddit, but after lots of self-evaluation, I don't spank her unless it's either something extremely dangerous, or she has done something I consider extremely bad. Like the time she purposefully took a huge, heavy board book and bashed me in the face with it while I was sitting and playing with her on the floor of her room. \n\nShe thinks it's funny to steal from people, and frequently gets in trouble at daycare from taking other kids things, and occasionally hitting them with it and this does not stop at home. I tell her it is not nice to hit people, and it makes me very sad. It's only a temporary fix, and I don't know what to do. When my husband is out working, I use the restroom with the door open, so she can play but I can go in peace. Recently, she'll go through bathroom drawers and take hair brushes, bobby pins, and face wash to play... but sometimes it's nail clippers or facial hair scissors and I tell her it's dangerous and nothing. If I take any of them away, it's the end of the world. If I ever tell her no, now speaking in general not just the bathroom, it's the crying where she flings backwards to flop on the floor and cry hysterically. \n\nWhen she wants my attention, it's whining crying for mommy. When we go upstairs, it's a full meltdown until I tell her she can physically walk up the stairs too. When she wants food or milk, she'll whine saying it over and over and over until it's ready to drink or eat. When we touch one of her toys to clean up, she will scream \"no, don't touch that!!!\" Or if I try to correct her behavior, she yells \"no, you're not the teacher!\" Which our in-home childcare provider has admitted all the kids at daycare hear that because they all tattle and boss each other around. \n\nSo last night, she was standing on a chair at dinner, and I kept asking her to sit down, eat her food, and stay at the table. If it got too excessive, I'd position her back to sitting myself. Finally, she fell and face planted. I was able to stick my hand out and soften the blow, but it still happened. My husband finally stood up, spanked her 4 times, and screamed that she should have listened and that she never behaves and she is now going to bed. So he stormed upstairs, put her in bed, and walked out. This very loud, explosive behavior scared the shit out of her and she started screaming, crying for me, snotting, and just total freak out. I tried explaining, that falling should have been enough punishment, because it scared her and she'll get the hint that standing on chairs = falling off.  He said that I can't tell him how to parent his child, and that if I'm going to do that I should parent her myself. I finally snapped and said I already do. I do everything for her, and all he does is scream and spank her. He left and came back a while later and didn't speak to me other than to say we're splitting finances next month, and clarified that he doesn't want a divorce when I inevitably freaked out. \n\nThis morning he woke up with her, read a book to her, changed her diaper, and brought her to our bed to cuddle. She got bored and started whining, and he said if she didn't quit whining, he would spank her... so I started singing with her and watched some Sofia the First to distract a little bit. Then I had to pee, and she got mad how long it took, so she took stuff out of the bathroom drawers and started throwing them in the bathroom. I finally said it was the last straw and that she needed to cool down in her room so I set her in the rocking chair in her room and she flipped out. Back arched, crying, screaming, snotting, throwing any toys and books in reach. So my husband came in, screamed at her that she's in time out until she quits crying and stormed out of the house. I stayed where she could see me, because she wanted me to console her, and when she calmed down I sat and hugged her for like 10 minutes. I asked why she was sad and she said \"Because daddy... tell me I fall\"\n\nI don't know man... she just told a kid at a doctors appointment that she lost her daddy when he was working, and now this. I'm at a loss, and it feels like if I passively or aggressively parent, it's all wrong. I'm more than willing to listen to any suggestions. My marriage is great otherwise, but he can't seem to tolerate toddlerhood and I'm freaking out. \n\n\nTL;DR - husband has snapped, toddler is unruly but still a toddler, and I'm a mess. Any advice so appreciated. \n\n---\n\nEdit: Ok thank you everyone, I think I'm finally tapping out. I've spent ~14 hours reading and responding, and now would like to sleep a bit before the little one wakes up. I have read *literally* every single comment and PM, good and bad, and have lots of things to talk about with my husband. Sorry I couldn't respond to everyone, I'm really on the verge of carpal tunnel after this lol seriously. I have lots of books to look up, tactics to try out (for longer than a day), and insight to digest. I really do appreciate ~~all~~ most comments, and thank you for taking the time to talk to me. I will still read comments when I wake up, so please feel free to comment more as it will not fall on deaf ears... eyes? To the people suggesting immediate divorce, I hope you find compassion, patience, and understanding in all of your present and future relationships.  ",

I told him a lot of dishes have butter, like for instance the macaroni uses butter but you can't even taste it, then I showed him the directions on the box where it says to add butter.  He said well I'm not going to eat macaroni anymore then.  I started to say you're going to eat it this time bc this is lunch and there won't be anything else when my MIL jumped in to say I'll make you some easy mac bc that doesn't have any butter.  In a split second she was already pulling it out of the pantry.\n\nWhy the heck are they so indulgent?  My mom is worse then my MIL and my dad is probably the worst of all.

            "selftext": "**Edit:** I would like to clarify that the main point of this post is that if your child or baby is \"coughing\" but no sound is coming out, they could be choking. My issue with my mother is not that she left him alone, but how and where she did it. I like to shit and shower in peace like everyone else, but I don't leave my son in such a broad area, unattended, while I do so. \n\nMy intention **is not** to judge anyone, or to tell anyone how or when they should leave their child unattended. I have my way of doing things, and I simply voiced my opinion in the matter of *my child* and nobody else's. \n\nPlease remember that parenting differently is not synonymous with being a bad parent. \n\n***\n\nMy husband, 3 yo son, and myself were outside trying to teach him how to ride his bike. It was ~90\u00b0 so my mom **insisted** we kept the baby inside, she would watch him. \n\nFirst, I vacuumed the carpet then did a spot check for anything the baby can put in his mouth. I set down a big blanket, put up his wooden playpen I made for him, and put his toys in there with him. \n\nWe're outside having a blast, trying to teach a 3 yo the concept of peddling is a lot harder than I thought. At one point I notice my mom outside without the baby. \n\nWhen I asked where the baby was, she said he's inside, playing. That he was \"safe because she latched the playpen\". Well, I still wasn't having it. I may be a young mom, but I understand babies are not to be left unattended. \n\nAfter picking him up I noticed he needed a diaper change. As I'm carrying him to his room, I'm tickling him, making funny faces, etc. and he's laughing. I lay him on the changing table and he looks at me, smiling. He starts coughing so I figured it's just spit up or spit went down the wrong pipe. \n\nAfter a few seconds, I don't know what possessed me to do it, I roll him onto his stomach, smack him three times (a little hard) in the middle of his back, until I can hear him cry. I pick him up, and a **fucking penny had come out of his mouth**. \n\nAfter I went to get him at *no* time did he have his hand anywhere near his mouth. We were laughing and playing and he had a penny in his mouth, unbeknownst to me, the entire time. I guess I knew something was wrong subconsciously when he was \"coughing/choking\". When no sound came out, my subconscious(?) probably thought back to the babysitting class I had taken 10 years ago. When he started coughing, the thought \"Oh he's not making noise he must be choking\" never entered my head, it was all a reaction I guess. And I'm very grateful it worked out the way it did. \n\nI honestly don't know how long my mom had left him alone for. Had things happened differently, we could've come inside to a blue-faced, dead baby. \n\n**Tl;dr:** If your baby is \"coughing\" but not making noise, they could be choking. My mom left my 9-month-old alone for however long. While alone he put a penny in his mouth. He didn't start choking on the penny until I was changing his diaper. I smacked the penny out. ",

            "selftext": "Title is basically the tl;dr\n\nThree-parent home (polyamorus: two moms, one dad), all parents have been together for a long time even prior to children's birth. \n\nOldest child co-slept with me (his bio mom) until just after a year old, and then slept in his full crib totally great for several months. Then, just before his second birthday (October), we all regressed to him falling asleep in my bed (he was sick a couple nights and I felt bad for him, so I lulled him to sleep in my bed, and then a couple nights turned into a week, and then oops).\n\nBedtime started taking longer and longer to complete, so we resolved to get him back in his - now no longer a crib, but now a toddler bed (he could climb out of his crib pretty easily). The toddler bed pretty quickly transformed to a twin mattress on the floor so he couldn't fall out of it (something that happened several nights in a row with the toddler bed).\n\nAlso, I was now pregnant again, and wanted him on a good routine before the baby came, because I knew he'd probably regress a little.\n\nOur actual ROUTINE is pretty solid - an hour &amp; fifteen mins before bed, he gets a fifteen min show (pretty much the only screen time he has all day, and it's not always consistent in that sometimes he skips it altogether or he watches a few short videos on one of our phones instead). Then it's \"quiet playtime\" for about a half-hour, and then bath, potty, teeth, book(s), talking about our day while laying in bed, then lights out by 7:30.\n\n(In the following I say \"we\" but this is really just to indicate that it affects all of us one at a time, whoever's in charge.)\n\nWe. Can't. Get. Out. Of. The Room. This is the #1 issue right now. We say good night, we leave, and he gets up practically the moment we get to the door and runs after us. We calmly, silently put him back in bed. He gets up and runs after us. We turn to calmly, silently put him back in bed, and he runs back to the bed and jumps on it, giggling. It turns into a game now, where he lets us close the door, then he waits a few moments, then we hear his little feet on the floor and he opens the door only to immediately run back to his bed. We close the door. He runs back to the door, etc. etc. over and over again.\n\nHe won't do any of that if we lay in the room with him (ugh). He's a kicker. He kicks the wall, the bed, the floor, US if we're too close, his plushes, anything he can get his feet on. It is LOUD. It is OBNOXIOUS. We try our hardest to ignore it, but laying in the room with him already puts our teeth on edge, so eventually his dad (who hates it the most) will end up telling him to stop and to lay quiet. Then that becomes a game, and the kid will be quiet for a moment after Dad asks him, only to rattle off a ton of kicks a minute later.\n\nDad &amp; his other Mom ended up doing a thing where they would hug him to get him to settle, but that would cause him to cry (they'd hug for too long; he didn't want to settle), so now he's crying big alligator moans while kicking. UGH.\n\nAll-in-all, we'd do lights out at 7:30 or 8 p.m. (depending on his nap), and then he'd end up not going to actual SLEEP until 9-9:30, or sometimes later.\n\nI had been slowly canceling out my participation in the late-stage bedtime routine as I got closer to my due date, but he desperately wanted to sleep in my bed (he treated it just like his bed but worse because my room has ~So~ many interesting things in it!), so we compromised by saying he has to \"first, sleep in his bed, then he can come to Mama's bed\" - this meant that any time between midnight-5 a.m., he'll come running into my room. He falls back asleep if he gets to me before 5 a.m., but after 5 a.m., he might just be up for the day :/\n\nI've been diligently researching how to handle this, and one of the things that gets repeated a lot on his forum is putting a baby gate up so that the toddler's bedroom door can stay open (or shut or whatever), but the toddler stays contained.\n\nSo, we did that. I explained to him why the gate was there, that we want him to be happy playing in his room, but he can't go out, and we're not coming in. I left a small light on for him (he usually doesn't have a nightlight, by his own request), told him he could read in bed, whatever.\n\nHe FREAKED. I haven't heard him cry that hard in a really long time, to the point of gagging, you know? His dad sat quietly on the other side of the gate to try the whole Supernanny thing of being a \"reassuring presence,\" but he spent the whole time tugging at the gate, heartbreaking sobs, \"Daddy come IN, Daddy come IN,\" and \"I need you Daddy, please!\"\n\nI'm nursing the baby in my room, feeling the anxiety in my chest just growing and growing, and my husband is on the floor with tears in his eyes. We give up after 10 minutes and just go hug him on his bed and clean his face and what not. Husband ended up staying with him while he fell asleep, the very thing we were trying to avoid.\n\nI just have NO CLUE WHAT TO DO. Our pediatrician wasn't any help last time we talked to him. He did say melatonin wouldn't work because it only helps you get to sleep when you WANT to sleep but can't, like you feel sleepy already. \n\nWe've tried pushing his bedtime back to 8:30 or so, but it's so clear he's hitting his second wind by then.\n\nWe've tried pulling his bedtime as early as 6:30, which only \"works\" in that the hour he spends kicking and whatever means that he's now asleep at 7:30 or so. \n\nAt this point I'm over the gate already, in that I can't see the logical means to its end - would he really just be like, \"cool, I can play in my room,\" after a certain point? Honestly, I'd just fucking let him sleep in my bed with me, if he didn't KICK everywhere the whole time.",

He didn't tell me about it. I thought he had gone to work, but then we heard him talking/yelling loudly at the tv in the back room. He played from 6am-330pm. Our 2 year old asked him to take a walk with us, he said he didn't want to. Sunday we went to the zoo. He was watching live gaming streams while we were walking around. \n\nHe doesn't think he has a problem. I understand gaming is fun and an easy time-suck. I play 1-2 hours a week, but I am left with all of the parenting and housework, disclaimer, I am a stay at home mother. I don't want to say he can't play at all, I'm not his mother and I know his job is stressful and he uses it to relax. But I can't help but view it as him escaping from us.  When I ask for help I get told to get a job. What is a reasonable limit to ask him to adhere to? I've asked him to limit it to playing after kids go to bed. I start our routine at 7 and he hardly ever is involved so he could actually play for 3 hours a night. But that isn't good enough for him.\n\n\nEdit to add: when a new game comes out he will literally take days off of work to play it. When the fuck do I get to take off 24-72 hours off of doing all the parenting and housework?  He doesn't see a problem with this at all!!!",

But, when I ask them to sweep a floor after dinner or wash a table, the answer I get is that someone else besides them ate at that table or dropped something on the floor, therefore, they refuse to do anything. \n\nI have already tried explaining to them that everyone walks on the floor and everyone eats at the table and everyone wears clothes, and so on, so the jobs that need to be done simply are split up and everyone does their part. Nope, they still refuse.\n\nI have been asking for the last several days for them to vaccum the rug in the living room and sweep the kitchen floor. They could each do one thing. Realize, they are teenagers. They both have been refusing, while declaring that they will only clean things that they are exclusively responsible for causing.\n\nSO, effective already, I have made them up a bill. The bill includes all costs from the electricity they use (why should we work to pay for electricity that someone other than us will use) to the water to the light bulbs in their rooms to the internet, to the price of their computers, to even the piano. They are now banned from everything until they pay for it. I will pay minimum wage. They have to earn enough money to purchase their computers back, for $500 a piece each. But they cannot just go straight for that because they need to pay for their own laundry detergent and electricity and water first. And they sure as heck will be paying for rides in the car to get to their activities. Don't worry, I only expect them to pay me minimum wage to drive them there.\n\nAnd that great dessert my husband made for tonight..only if they have the money to buy it from us. \n\nI figure it should not even take 24 hrs before they fold and decide sweeping one floor once out of an entire day was a good deal.

Our son crawls over to his booster seat (on the floor so he can get in by himself, he's a little delayed so he's not walking quite yet)  and we watch a bit of a tv show together. When he's done he plays nearby while we finish eating, then it's either more play time if it's early enough or bath time. \n\nThat's the ideal scenario anyway. Sometimes our son is too loud for us to watch a show, sometimes other stuff just throws off our routine. I know there are some families where the parents don't eat till after the kids are in bed. So I was curious what dinner looks like in other houses with toddlers.\n\nEdit: Wow, thank you so much everyone! This has become quite the topic. I've been reading every response even if I haven't responded to all of them. I appreciate everyone's comments, thanks for participating in this conversation.",

He hits my child on purpose and the smile on his face when he laughs and smiles about it gives me chills. When he was younger he use to bite his siblings and niece's and nephew's.  He's grown out of that stage but now he scratches, punches, etc. \n\nToday I'm writing cause it concerns me of what he actually did last night and I'm concerned for my child's health. I just had woken up to make my child a bottle of milk (she has SPD and still is on bottles. As I was pouring her a bottle of milk I poured myself a glass as well and when I took a drink it tasted awful, like pure rubbing alcohol. At first I thought it was the glassed I poured it in but then I smelled the jug of milk and noticed there was a bottle of rubbing alcohol on the kitchen counter that was empty. I got panicked, spilled it all down the drain and started searching up what would happen if it was drank (I'm in panic mode now) I'm not sure if the bottle I made her previously was contaminated or not but she has SPD so I'm hoping and praying that it wasn't cause she would know. I have no proof he did it but I just know in my heart he did. He's a little sadistic shit of kid. \n\nAnyway should I take my child to the E.R. So far she's acting fine in her sleep but I'm not sure. She had a fever earlier but I think that was cause to her teeth (she's been complaining her teeth hurt) has a dentist appointment tomorrow. Once again I don't know if the milk had been contaminated earlier or just 4-5 hours ago. \n\nAlso, my brother and his wife are temporarily staying with us and because they had a conflict with my other brother they were staying with about their kids. So I feel like if I bring this up they'll be devastated but their kid is just too bad",

It started last Friday and they plan on continuing throughout the rest of the spring.\n\nI talked to the school about it last week and they said they haven't seen anything and there is nothing they can do. My daughter, however, was very upset because she said she was slapped multiple times in the butt on Friday. She loves school, but is nervous about going tomorrow because she doesn't want her butt to be slapped. This happens in the hallways while the kids are changing classes and on the bus. My daughter only takes the bus in the morning, but she said she has been slapped multiple times by walking in the hallways and on the bus in the mornings. \n\nMy daughter has proof of people talking about it on social media. Will that mean anything if she screenshots it and brings it to the principal in the morning? I don't like that my daughter has to be fearful of this. My older two sons are both pretty pissed about it as well, but they are in high school so there isn't much they can do about it. ",

I stood in a luke warm shower holding her and crying because she was so weak she could hardly lift her head and there was nothing I could do about it.\n\nLuckily she's on the road to recovery now but this could of all been avoided if people would quit believing the anti-vax bullshit and realize that the most vulnerable population is suffering because of their choice.\n\nFuck you if you believe that vaccination do more harm than good, I've seen first hand what that way of thinking brings and I will eternally be supporting vaccinations for all who can.\n\nThanks for reading, sorry for the profanity.\n\n**Edit: Thank you for all the well wishes for our daughter, she's finally starting to get back to her normal self again but we are currently in quarantine until Thursday.

            "selftext": "My 5 year old daughter recently started going to a new school. I've always packed her lunch and it's never been a problem. However at her new school there are \"nutrition guidelines\" for brought from home lunches. They must include one serving of meat, one serving of dairy, on serving of grains etc. \n\nMy daughter is vegan and has been since birth, so obviously I'm not going to send her to school with meat and dairy. She eats very healthy and I pay extra attention to making sure she gets the proper nutrients. For the past couple weeks she is continually coming home with \"your lunch needs improvement !\" notes. Which are notes given to students who's lunches don't meet the guidelines with the missing food group highlighted. So my daughter keeps bringing home notes with the \"dairy\" and \"meat\" sections highlighted. I wrote on one of them that we are vegan and I will not be packing meat or dairy in her lunch. \nThe teacher wrote back: \n\n\"The nutritional guidelines are mandatory and decided by the district. We ask that you please respect them. Thank you!\"\n\nSo at this point I'm rather annoyed and I emailed the principal explaining the situation, today I finally got a response that said: \n\n\"Thank you for contacting me. \nThe nutritional guidelines for school lunches are set in place by the district and must be followed. What you feed your student at home is your business. However, when at school certain nutritional needs must be met. We understand certain students may have very specific dietary needs that make this difficult. In your case we ask that you please send your child with a vegan dairy substitute as well a vegan meat substitute each day. It is important that students eat a healthy balanced lunch each day to help them focus and learn. If these rules are not followed it may result in disciplinary action. Thank you for your time. \"\n\nNow if you aren't totally familiar with veganism you might think this is fine. Just send her with some vegan dairy and vegan meat right? The thing is vegan cheeses, yogurts, meats and other things are not something you want to be eating everyday. They are  more of an occasional food. I am just not willing to have my child eat vegan meat everyday, it would not be healthy. I don't know what to do at this point, do I email the principal back? What do I say? I'm honestly annoyed at this, my daughter eats a healthy lunch each day,  much more healthy then a student eating say, a bologna sandwich and a yogurt drink...and yet those things fit with the nutritional guidelines. What do I do? ",

            "selftext": "I just need to say this somewhere. I was in an abusive relationship with a narcissist hippy for 5 years. We had two children together. I finally left him one year ago after finding out he was sexually inappropriate with one of our children. One year of a hellish  $80,000 custody battle later, I gained full guardianship and complete decision making. I got my kids fully vaccinated, which is something he would never allow. I can't explain how happy I am. \n\nEdit: wow! I really didn't expect this post to get so much attention. Thank you so much for all of your support everyone. I've been overwhelmed with constantly smiling knowing that so many kind strangers have said such nice things about my situation.  \n\nI want to clarify that I do not hate hippies. I'm not sure why I chose the wording I did, it just seemed like the best description for my ex at the time. \n\nTo those of you in similar situations: feel free to message me whenever you need. I'm no lawyer, but I could give you some tips and advice that helped me get through this. I'll also just talk for support if you need it. \n\nAnd to those telling me that vaccinating my children was the wrong choice (which I expected honestly): Every decision I've made since I left that relationship has been to benefit me and my children. I recognize that there are risks to vaccines. For me, those risks were outweighed by the peace of mind knowing that my children won't have to suffer a vaccine preventable disease that may lead to death, or pass those on to other people's children. That would be a huge amount of guilt that I'm not prepared to live with. \n\nAgain just thank you everyone, thank you for your kind words, your stories, your jokes, and your support. It means a lot to me. \n\n",

            "selftext": "My sweet, overachieving 9 y/o daughter R has suddenly developed an atrocious attitude. She's become bossy and loud. She complains constantly that she needs new everything and deserves it for getting good grades. She's pissed off all her friends with her mean girl attitude and got temporarily suspended for spitting on a girl at school who was wearing the same headband as she was. I'm horrified because she's never acted this way in her life. We took away her phone and privileges but the attitude has only gotten worse. \n\n\nEvery year she goes to Disneyland with the same group of friends for a birthday. Her friend's mom gets a discount so she pays for the tickets and we pay her back. I was going to pull R from the trip for her behavior but my friend already bought the girls tickets, not knowing. It's not easily refundable. I'll have to pay for the ticket anyway, is it really worth it to prove a point? It seems ridiculous to me that she would go on a trip like this with the way she's behaved but that's a bit of money. Her dad thinks we should let her go and let her know she'll be punished afterward. \n\n\n**Edit:** She got caught using her cousin's phone to text again so she's definitely not going anywhere. The birthday girl is going to take someone else. After R was done throwing a tantrum she and I had a long talk. I had no idea so much was going on because she puts up a happy front. Her dad and I had a disagreement over her that I didn't realize she was still bothered about. She gets down on herself for every mistake at school, she's growing apart from her friends and she's way more insecure about her looks than I realized. She's also having mood swings that I think are definitely hormonal. I'm not excusing her but I was unaware of how much was going on inside her head.\n\n\n Regardless she's going to be spending her weekends with the old ladies at church, making pierogis and sweeping. I'm also looking at new activities she can do apart from her current friend group. We also decided she has to earn 100 dollars over the summer to donate to charity. I don't know what to do for the girl she spit on except make sure my daughter leaves her alone from now on, I don't want to single her out too much as they're still going to be in the same class when my daughter goes back.",

We researched a lot and although the name seemed awfully silly, it felt wrong to take his name from him. \n\nHis name is the name of a piece of furniture. For the sake of the question, I will use the first name Table. We actually decided to keep his entire name but we just rearranged things to include our surnames. His full name was Table Michael Harrison. My husband and I gave our son both of our last names and made Michael and Harrison both his middle names. Therefore, his name became Table Michael Harrison Smith-Jones. You still with me? \n\nHe started kindergarten last year and was getting made fun of for his name. I told him that he could use one of his middle names if he preferred that. He decided to use Harrison from that point forward. \n\nIt took a little while to get everyone on board, but he was in first grade this year and everyone now calls him Harrison. \n\nHe gets upset any time he sees his actual first name written down on forms. He gets upset when he has a substitute and she calls him Table. He really doesn't like his first name and he said it makes him think of bad things. \n\nHis 7th birthday is coming up and he asked if we could change his name to Harrison for his birthday present. We told him that we would think about it. Of course, that won't be his only present but it struck me as pretty serious that it was his birthday request. \n\nHe wants to get ride of Table completely and become Harrison Michael Smith-Jones. Would you let your kid do it. \n\nNote: None of the names are real. His first name is after a piece of furniture and the name he wants to use (his former last name, current second middle name) can be used as a first name. ",

I just feel like she's TOO comfortable and \"established\" when she's so young and isn't working hard enough in building a career in which she can fully support herself. She doesn't really date anyone as far as I know.. had emotional issues when younger but have been better up until now. Me and her mom never really had a problem with her at all, but honestly just think there's no future for her here in this small town and that's why we encourage her to move out the house!\n\ntl;dr: Mandatory summary/question! Ask daughter to move out. Her saying \"What do you want me to go and do? Fine if you want me out so bad, fine I'll leave and just become a prostitute or find a sugar daddy, easy.\" Was really shocking actually and we never expected that of her. Honestly don't know what to say anymore.",

            "selftext": "My 14 year-old son has been saving up for the Xbox One. Last week a classmate offered to sell him his used one saying that he is turning 16 soon and is trying to save up to buy a car. My wife and I were fine with this and it was a good deal.\n\nA few days after he bought it his grandmother gifted him the newer Xbox model as a late birthday gift.  So, he no longer needed the one he bought from the classmate.\n\nNow, the reason he had decided to buy an Xbox in the first place was because he used to play Xbox in the rec room at our church, but the console there recently stopped working.  He decided that he wanted to give the one he purchased from his classmate to the church rec room.  We were proud of his generosity. \n\nHowever, Wednesday morning his classmate's mother called my office and said that she and her husband had purchased the Xbox originally and her son was not allowed to sell it, so we need to trade back.  I explained that my son no longer has it so we won't be able to do that. She was very upset and said that not only was her son not allowed to sell it, but he sold it far under value.  She asked us to pay additional money to match the going rate on eBay/Craigslist.  \n\nTo be honest, I am not interested in doing anything extra. My son didn't take advantage of the other boy in any way; the boy simply offered a good deal because he wanted money quickly and he wanted more than he could get by trading it in at a video game store.\n\nI explained that while it was a good price, in my opinion it wasn't unfairly good.  Furthermore, that's the kind of the risk you take when you give teenagers expensive things - they might break them or lose them, or in this case, sell them.  In my eyes my son did nothing wrong and was responsible about the transaction.\n\nShe said that if we aren't willing to address it privately she and her husband would go to the school about this.  Now, I don't think the school would actually do anything about it, but who knows.\n\nAnyone else go through something like this?  I want to be understanding but I don't think anything bad actually happened.",

I have loving feelings inside me for each of them but a boiling pot of rage-full hate as well. I regret having children and therefore regret getting married. One kid was enough but now there are two. I haven't had more than an hour of pleasant interaction with my wife since the second kid came along. Before that it was maybe an hour a week with the first kid. Before that it was maybe half the week as married people. \n\nWe've done all the therapy and it has and hasn't helped. I'm a better person and father but it hasn't cured the resentment that my own life is over and I live for everyone else. I'm always only putting other people first and getting shit on when I don't. I hate it. I fucking hate it. I'm so miserable I cry almost everyday. I've thought about medication but then what kind of life am I living?\n\nI want out but I hate the thought of abandoning any one of them. I don't want to screw up my kids or make my wife's life any harder. I just also don't want to have any of this anymore. I miss sleep. I miss quiet. I miss planning for vacation. I miss spending money on fun things. I miss a clean house. I can't for the life of me find my happy place.  \n\nI thought it would get better as they got older. It has a little. It's nice to see the older one discover the world but it's fucking exhausting. So many things to explain and it's not going to end. My responsibility not to fuck them up is only going to increase as they make their way in the world. I don't want that. I don't want to have to shape them into people. I'm crying now just thinking about the amount of work and effort I'm going to have to put in just so they turn out all right. They're going to have so many trivial experiences that mean so much to them and I'm going to have to help them ride it out and give a shit when I fucking don't. \n\nI don't know what to do. If you have been through this or have any advice I'd appreciate it. I don't really need any commentary on myself (I've got therapy for that) or judgement (I have a wife for that), but if you're like me, or know someone like me, or have any helpful advice on getting through this or what the future may hold, I'll take it. Thanks and have a wonderful holiday\n\ntl;dr: I love each of my family members but hate the responsibility and day-to-day of having a family and don't know how to find my happy place. \n\nEdit: Thank you for all of your thoughts and advice. I'm working to reply to everyone. \n\nEdit 2: This has been locked so I'm not going to be able to respond to everyone. I want to say thank you again for the support, advice, and perspective. I really do appreciate it. I wish you all well",

            "selftext": "Welcome to my December hell. On Tuesday night, while I was out of town, my wife held a gingerbread house and wine party for her boss and some of her work colleagues at our house. \n\nSomehow, after everyone was three chardonnays in, the conversation turned to the differences between Christmas in Georgia (where we live now) and Pennsylvania (where we moved from 2 years ago). At this point, my wife bleeps up badly, praising the South, trashing the North. Then my wife mentions that the only one of the family who truly misses the old place is our middle kid (7th grade), which leads my wife's boss to say that he must be \"fucking retarded\" for doing so (my wife claims she's refilling wine glasses when this happens). Then, just to make everything even worse, my wife mentions that there was an option to return 6 months ago that she didn't put in for. It's twelve minutes and thirty nine seconds of pure, gloaty, triumphalist poison in which everyone joins in. And how do I know this? Because middle kid is overhearing the whole conversation from upstairs and recording it.\n\nAt this point, I need to say this. The move has been an epic disaster for the middle kid, who had nothing to gain from it and everything to lose; and then on top of that pretty much every single thing that could go wrong once we got here has happened. This is mostly our fault.  He hates when we talk poorly about the old home and has asked us specifically and repeatedly not to do it (\"the least you can do is be respectful\"). We also told him that we only moved because it was necessary to save Mom's career (which he now knows isn't true). Those 12:39 have been absolutely shattering to him. He's not talking to anyone right now, and I really can't blame him.\n\nSo having heard what he's heard, he goes apeshit. Everyone's finished their arts and crafts and have moved to the living room. Middle baseball bats the gingerbread houses, storms into the living room, calls my wife and my wife's friends colossal a-holes, and then tells them all to get the fork out of the house. Then he takes off out into the cold, shattering all the wine bottles and heaving a brick through my wife's car windshield for good measure.\n\nWhich leaves me with a colossal mess to try to pick up the pieces from:\n\na) I'm most concerned about trying to save face with middle kid. What my wife and her coworkers did was completely and utterly appalling. My wife knows absolutely not to go where she did, and she went there with gusto.  I'm supposed to punish him for this, but have already decided that whatever he gets is half a slap on the wrist. This is entirely my wife's fault.\n\nOn a bigger level, I'm wholly unsure how to undo the massive levels of betrayal he's got to be feeling. He now knows he was completely sold out to make this work. It's the holidays, which makes this all even worse on so many levels.\n\nb) At the same time, my wife's boss is screaming for an apology in the next two weeks, else my wife doesn't get her annual pay raise. My son flat out won't do a unilateral apology, and having heard the tape, she doesn't deserve one. I have neither a carrot nor stick big enough to get there, and I really don't want to lie my ass off with promises to get it. Yet somehow I'm going to have to get him to barf out \"I'm sorry.\" rather than \"Fork you very much.\" the next time he sees her.",

The 14 year-old is one of my daughter's closest friends, in fact.\n\nShe has been invited to a baby shower for one of the girls, and has been asked to be involved in the one being thrown for her close friend. Apparently this girl's mother asked our daughter to help decorate, come up with and run baby shower games, etc.  Another close friend (the third part of their \"trio\") was also asked. My daughter did not see it as a big deal, and agreed. \n\nMy wife and I have been nervous about how this will affect our daughter.  My wife feels that attending baby showers, playing party games, etc., will glamorize and normalize teen pregnancy. I don't necessarily disagree, but I also don't want to prevent her from taking part because I don't want to give the impression that we think it's alright to abandon someone we care about because they are going through something difficult.\n\nLast night she told my wife that her friend gets to have two people in the delivery room, and in addition to her own mother, she has asked my daughter to join her. She asked my wife if we would allow it, and my wife said she doesn't think so (we don't even know if the hospital would allow it, for that matter, which would be an easy way out). After my wife and I talked about it today she said she wonders if seeing the \"miracle of childbirth\" might actually instill in our daughter the seriousness of the situation and make her think seriously about the implications of sex, but I simply don't think that she is emotionally prepared for it. \n\nSex has always been a topic of open discussion in our house (though much more so between her and my wife than between her and myself).  We believe that she is well-educated, and we have made all resources (e.g. birth control) available to be responsible.\n\nHowever, not only is this coming a couple of years earlier than we expected, we also never envisioned her being involved in the process in ways that might \"normalize\" it.\n\nWhat now?",

            "selftext": "My 4 year old daughter has a favorite color. I bet your kid does too, maybe you do too. \n\nWhile waiting at the pediatrician this week my kid stated to another kid that her favorite color was blue. The other child replied that blue can't be her favorite color, because she's a girl and that girls like purple or pink. \n\nI'm a strong believer in letting kids be kids and that if they need to argue they should argue among themselves and find a solution because... let's be realistic, I won't always be around and I'd rather them know how to solve problems without me. \n\nSo my daughter keeps telling the other kid that nope, she's a girl and she likes blue, not purple and not pink. The other kid can't understand that, he says only boys like blue. After going back and forth, the mom of the other kid joins in and tells me daughter \"for Halloween, were you a superhero or a princess? Isn't it much more fun to be a princess?\" And wow. No. \n\nMy daughter replied that she was captain America for Halloween and that she doesn't like princesses. The mom told her she didn't believe her. The pediatrician, whose door was open and over heard the whole discussion came to greet my daughter and told her \"Woah! Captain America for Halloween? Is it because his costume is blue?\" My kid nodded yes and the pediatrician continued \"We have something in common, I too love blue. I think it's a great color for girls or for boys.\" He then called the other kid in and that was it.\n\nHowever, it really marked my kid. She questioned me later as to why blue couldn't be her favorite color and why the other kid thought that. I'm sure she will be ok. I explained the big lines to her but I can feel that she's annoyed. favorite colors are a big deal for a 4 year old... Anyway, for all you parents out there who let your kids be kids and have their own personally preferences, good job, keep it up! You might feel like you're just doing what's expected of you but you're actually helping your child to be accepting and understanding of others. ",

So I finished what I was doing and then set and thought for a little bit how I wanted to handle this. My first reaction was to completely in enrage upon him and tell him he was punished and just getting very mad. But I realized that he is just curious and I was a young boy as well. So I sat down and talked with him and told him that I understand he is curious but there are ways to learn about sex and ways to not learn about sex and that p*** was not a way to learn about sex. I encouraged him to come and talk to me if he had questions. I then set up some parental controls on the iPad with web filtering. Do you think I handled it properly?",

            "selftext": "I'm turning 36 soon and have one planned and wanted child who is almost 1.  Naturally the pressure is on from friends and family (and my aging eggs) on when and if a 2nd is coming.  What a friend said the other day was \"I've heard of people saying they regret having kids but I've never heard anybody say they regret having more than one child assuming they were cool with having one in the first place.\"\n\nSo I'm curious if anybody feels regret at having more than one.  I always knew I'd regret my life when I'm old if I never attempted to have at least one.  Beyond that, I'm just not sure.  We have an easy baby who sleeps well and eats well.  I'm sure I won't get lucky twice and have another angel baby.  Both my husband and I are not baby people, but we understand that this phase doesn't last long and basically can't wait for our kid to grow up and turn into a person.  But we've now settled into a nice routine.  Most importantly, we still have time to do our own things.  We both work and one child makes balancing a professional life manageable.  On weekends, it's easy to switch off when I go to the gym or run errands or my husband goes to play his sports.  We like to travel and have a few trips planned this winter with our son.  I can't imagine taking car seats and gear for 2 children on a trip.  We also will take an intl trip just the 2 of us in the spring when grandma will watch our son for a week.  Naturally trips like those will be much harder if not impossible if we have 2.  As sprightly as my mother is, I would not want to subject her to two young children for a week.  I just know my husband and I would be less happy with 2 young kids for a good 5 years, maybe longer.  But I see the appeal of having 2 adult children when I'm in my 50s-60s.  Is it worth it to take away the little free time that we have now for possible long term gain of having 2 children to nag on the phone when I'm retired?\n\nAs a side note, I know lots of people have another child to give their first a companion.  That is not a consideration of mine because I feel like it's not my job to give my child a companion nor it is a guarantee they will get along.  If we have a second, it's because we want to for our family and not for his benefit.  I'm just trying to figure out if it's worth ruining my current situation for possible gain in the far off future.  Or am I going to regret ruining the good thing we have going with our little clan of 3?\n\n",

            "selftext": "Everyone in my house  has a severe case of food poisoning. Barfing and diarrhea (except the one person who didn't eat True Story\u2122 organic ham from Costco). Wife is out of commission...I thought she was dead laying on the bathroom floor when I came home and found her there. I have twin girls age 7....here is what I've learned so far tonight...\n\nTo get your kids prepared:\n\n1. Prepare for midnight barfing and diarrhea: put a bucket (as large as you can find, as they will have bad aim) next to the child's bed (and for everyone else sick in the house).\n1. Put another bucket in each bathroom in-front of the toilet. This will come in handy when they have a diarrhea attack and barf at the same time. I neglected to do this and my daughter barfed all over the floor while sitting on the toilet (if you have a long  journey to the nearest toilet consider putting a bucket halfway -- *not necessary if you have dogs*). If you don't have lots of buckets, use indoor garbage cans (don't bother with a bag). If you don't have that, use the Halloween baskets like I did (this may or may not have an added benefit of associating illness with halloween candy). As long as its plastic and will hold chunky liquid, it should work -- the bigger the better. If the Halloween bucket has a small opening on top, its not good. Their aim won't be that good. Use a salad bowl instead.\n1. Be sure to tell them its imperative that they don't shit or puke in the bed. I can clean up that stuff from a wood floor (my dogs love it!), but if its the bedding its going to be a lot more work. I told my kids to try to make it to the bathroom, but if they only make it to the hallway that's fine. Just avoid the bed at all costs!\n1. Who cares if its passed their bedtime, get them in their PJs, and let them snuggle up with a blanket on the couch until they fall asleep. It will be easy to put them to bed. There will be no resistance. My kids will refuse to go to sleep if they are not feeling well, so why fight it?\n1. Praise them on what a great job they did when they throw up in the hallway, they didn't puke or shit the bed, this is primary concern and if its avoided they should be rewarded.\n1. Don't encourage self pity...this will backfire eventually. I get it, being sick sucks, but encouraging them to whine and whimper all day will drive you absolutely bat shit crazy in the end.\n1. If they barf or shit, you can take the rug, clothes, etc out back and spray it down with a hose -- get the washing machine going with lots of detergent + bleach first, high-power. You gotta get those chunks off first though. It's either that or throw it away, but that's another $50-100 bucks I would rather spend on something else....like roses if my wife lives through the night.\n1. Lock the dogs up or just keep them outside or in the garage. Mine will try to eat the shit and puke if it ends up on the floor.\n1. If your daughters have long hair, *be sure to put it back in a bun or pony tail* otherwise they will lean over and puke into the bucket and get it all over their hair, which will then mean taking a shower. I didn't do this the first time...had to bath them again. I found a few videos on youtube on how to do this. (rubber bands are not good unless your child enjoys their hair being pulled out by the roots, string is better).\n1. ....brb, someone is throwing up...\n1. ...bucket saved the day, no mess...rinsed the bucket in the shower, good to go!\n1. Make sure your shower has one of those extensions on the shower head, its much easier to clean, or just use a hose outside. Don't bother disinfecting as you'll be doing it again in 30 minutes.\n1. If you have multiple people sick, make sure each bathroom has an extra bucket in it and each person has one by their bed -- incase you missed it, this will save the day when they are having a diarrhea attack followed by a barfing attack. Also leave the seat up, so they can plop down easy in an emergency.\n1. Don't leave the house. You're fucked, forget stepping out for a bite to eat, order a pizza if you're hungry.\n1. Make sure they drink water once they are done puking (even better if you can get some lipton sweet lemon iced tea in the can, this makes the puke not as bad tasting down and up), it helps avoiding dry heaves. don't let them eat food but water will at least give them something to throw up.\n1. Have a damp washcloth ready to go so they can wipe their face off. When finished, go wash it off and get it ready for round 8.\n1. Do not under any circumstances let them sleep in your bed. Unless you want to change it in the middle of the night and wake up your dying/sick spouse.\n1. Open the windows and doors. It'll start to smell like puke in the house...and may eventually lead to *you* puking. Just get some air flow going, give 'em an extra blanket if they are cold.\n1. Leave lights on in the hall/bathroom so they can get to it easy and aren't scared of the dark.\n1. Have a change of PJs and clean towels ready to go. At the very least know where to find them, otherwise you'll have to wake up the wife because your clueless ass has no idea where these things are...you'll have to check every drawer.\n1. My kids always want to use getting sick as an excuse not to go to school the next day. I say \"let's play it by ear\" I won't want them at school if they are going to throw up, but if they are 100% in the morning, they damn well better be getting ready for school.\n1. Don't take it personally when little cunts down vote your well intended Pro Tip.\n1. As the dad, just stay up as late as you can. It's pretty common for me to stay up until 2-3am anyway, but it's going to be much easier to respond when someone gets an attack if you hear it immediately rather than being woken up. I already called in sick at work  for tomorrow, so I can just sleep in if I stay up until 4am. My wife hopefully will be able to take over at 6am when she usually wakes up.\n1. Also, after you hose off the puke from the rugs/clothing, and set the wash to go. Be sure you actually put the clothes *IN* the washing machine. I ran the damn thing with only soap/water for 20 minutes before my wife asked why the dirty clothes were on the garage floor.\n1. More down voting? you people have no sense of humor\n1. Report food poisoning on your state's health web site (if you can find the damn form). warning: all government sites were built in the late 90s. Do not attempt to find it on your mobile phone...unless you enjoy squinting and pinch-zooming to read.\n1. Sit in their room with them while they fall back asleep. I turn on classical music (amazon prime has some free mp3s) or put on the Vin Scully (i hate the dodgers but this man is a legend...my kids fall right asleep as soon as they hear his voice). If the dodgers are not at home or the game is over, find Vin Scully broadcasts on youtube. Has the added benefit of being part of history. Also Jon Miller is good too if you can't bring yourself to watch the dodgers.\n1. Unless you want an angry sick, half dead wife yelling at you, its important that you are on your A-game when it comes to running interference. The last thing I want them to do is to go in and wake up their mother. Everyone will suffer if they get passed you, especially you.\n1. Don't let the dog sleep on your child's bed. If it decides to go take another shit outside, you may wind up with a crying kid who needs to be comforted back to sleep again when it jumps off the bed and wakes her up.\n1. Keep telling your kids that they will feel better in the morning, as soon as its out of their system -- this is how your body fights food borne ISIS. Puking is good for them...It also makes them feel better, because one of mine thought this might actually be the end for her.\n1. Don't bother with porn tonight...you'll get interrupted (guaranteed). Install Kodi/Exodus and watch whatever the hell you want for free.\n1. Be sure to check the puke for blood. If you see blood call 9-1-1. BONUS: DO NOT ACCEPT AN AMBULANCE (unless you've got $2500 to burn).\n1. If you hear coughing coming from the back bedroom, bolt in there immediately. Remember: A-game.\n1. Its important to comfort your wife while simultaneously avoiding making her talk (and trying not to plan a memorial in your head and how you'll raise the kids alone *just in case*)...I find asking questions like \"What's for dinner?\" just makes her angry.\n1. Realize you overlooked one important detail. The elderly sickly woman whom you do not recognize just yelled from the back of the house that she *will definitely not* be up at 6am and you'll have to take the kid who isn't sick to school in 2 hours. 2 hour power nap baby!\n1. I've decided to forego sleeping at all tonight. Going to bed now would be like leaving in the bottom of the 9th of a tie game. It simply no longer makes any sense.\n1. 4:17am I AM AMPED UP FOR SOME REASON!!! IS THIS WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO BE AN OLYMPIAN? I FEEL LIKE I COULD PAINT THE HOUSE TOMORROW IN UNDER 2 MINUTES!! 2 MORE HOURS UNTIL FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL...I'M GOING TO GET THE PREMIER PARKING SPOT!!!\n1. i'm starting to come down off that weird high that I experienced a little bit ago. 1 more hour until dawn....must....stay....awake...\n1. I'm starting to get hungry, i haven't eaten a thing in 14 hours. Wondering  if diner-on-wheels delivers McDonald's sausage mcmuffins this early in the morning (I'm avoiding any organic ham until further notice due to its packaging stating there are no preservatives used). Still can't leave house for nourishment as someone might still die.\n1. After scanning government web sites for the past 2 hours and 45 minutes I found the form (I had to use greasemonkey to automatically inject any .gov site I visited with bootstrap so I don't suffer any brain trauma looking at hundreds of poorly designed government web sites).\n1. The high powered special ops precision flashlights I bought on amazon (4-pack for $20) came in handy when I had to go look at the ham that i threw in the garbage to find out what brand it was in order to report food poisoning. If it weren't for the million candle power beam I may have accidentally touched some of the dogshit that was covering it. It's important that I report this to the health dept. I may be at ground zero for some kind of food borne ISIS super virus that the CDC isn't telling anyone about yet.\n1. Its 5:09am now. Still no sounds of birds chirping. I hope they didn't catch the food borne ISIS super virus. Nothing. No sign of life. Except I hear someone's cat getting raped...so that's a good sign. Cats are immune.\n1. I'm starting to understand the benefit of owning the front-loading washer and dryer that don't require you to bend over. Also freezers on top? what idiot came up with that? Was there an explosion of midget household appliance inventors in the 50s I wasn't aware of? I never use the freezer which is easy to access but I bend over to look in the fridge all the damn time. I think I know what I'm buying the wife for something other than her birthday or Christmas....or valentines day....or our anniversary....or mother's day. Next 4th of July we are going to MAKE OUR REFRIGERATOR GREAT AGAIN!. Its a year away, but I'm not allowed to buy her something like this for the normal gift-giving holidays.\n1. 5:48am -- my cat just came in from the cold...he seems ok, so it wasn't him that got raped. Although there's no conclusive evidence that he *isn't* the rapist.\n1. No puking for the past 2 hours. Starting to get a little loopie though. I am trying to recall how to get to the kid's school. I have no idea where the new classroom is....and my stomach is starting to gurgle. Don't know if I've been infected with the super virus or just hungry.\n1. 9:29am I'm back from dropping the kid off at her first day of school She was so happy. Kids really are fun to watch. When I introduced myself to the teacher I forgot my own name. I didn't think to mention that my other kid was not there. I completely forgot I had twins. This must be how parents of singletons feel everyday. Weird.\n1. I received what I can only assume were signs from God on my way home from school. Either that or I'm going slightly insane.\n",

            "selftext": "Hey all, I'm Ed and my family's got a bit of a problem. I'm not sure if this is the right place for this post but I'm not sure where else to put it. To make it less confusing I added names. Daughter is Elizabeth and wife is Marie.\n\n\nMy 17 y/o daughter is 3 weeks pregnant with her 16 y/o boyfriend's baby. She is in no way, shape, or form ready to take care of a child. I think she does understand that she acted irresponsibly, as from what I understand they just got caught up in the heat of the moment and she realized immediately after what had just occurred.\n\n\nThe thing is, first of all, Elizabeth came to me rather than her mother and I know she is hurt, confused, and angry about that. This quote is from my wife, who is right next to me and typed it herself.\n\n\n**I don't see her getting pregnant as a mistake. She has taken the sexual education class at school and talked to both of us about it numerous times. She knows how it works and she knew what she was doing. Elizabeth has \"made mistakes\" before and gotten away with it. The cops who were at her friend's party were lenient when she was caught drinking alcohol. The teachers at school have cut her some slack for fudging papers. But on this \"mistake\", a human life was made, and I think that's a pretty big screw up if you ask me. She's claimed for months she's almost an adult, she did the adult act of sex, so I think it's time she face the adult consequences of her actions and maybe next time she'll think twice before being so irresponsible.**\n\n\nSo basically, my wife isn't going to allow Elizabeth to get the abortion she feels is best for herself and the baby. I've tried convincing her that this isn't the right thing to do and there's other ways to convey the consequences to our daughter but she just isn't listening. I even pointed out that most likely we'd end up being the ones primarily caring for the baby but even that didn't sway her.\n\n\nPlease, help me get through to my wife before my daughter ends up having a child she doesn't want and can't care for.\n\n\nEdit 1: I forgot to add, Elizabeth did tell her boyfriend and his parents and they have pretty much left it up to us - they basically said they don't what we do either way so it's not like they're gonna want to take care of it. It sounds awful but my wife asked me, \"You would rather her get an abortion than take care of the baby?\" And the answer is yes. I love kids, that's why I already have 4 of my own. Elizabeth is our youngest and it's not that I didn't love fathering young kids but I don't think I could care for infants anymore if I wanted to. Marie thinks that makes me a bad person but I'm looking forward to being a *grandparent* whenever one of my daughters are actually ready and willing to have a baby.\n\nEdit 2: We can't just go get an abortion because it's highly disrespectful to my wife to go behind her back and neither of us want to lose her. She has made it very clear that if this happens, we aren't her husband and daughter anymore. I need something that will loosen her up and see that this isn't such an evil awful thing but rather what's best for everyone involved.\n\n\n\n***TL;DR: My daughter is pregnant and my pro-lifer wife is adamantly against her getting an abortion as she feels this is the opportunity for daughter to \"face the consequences of her actions\". Daughter's boyfriend and his family want nothing to do with it.***\n\n\n**UPDATE**\nLast night (it's 4:30 am right now) I read almost all of the comments, discussed it with my daughter, then with my wife, then with all 3 of us together. The conclusion we have come to is that the best solution to this is for Elizabeth to have an abortion.\n\n\nWe did think of all possibilities, from adoption (and although a couple of you even offered to adopt the baby yourselves we aren't comfortable with that) to allowing another family member to take it in, to keeping it, and we always seemed to circle back around to abortion. \n\n\nWe don't wish to go with adoption because, even though we may have full control over who the baby goes with, I truly don't think my daughter could handle the emotional turmoil that comes with carrying a child for 9 months only to give birth to it and watch it leave. I don't think she could handle it, sitting in school or working, knowing something that she made was out there being taken care of and raised in a way that she may not find suitable.\n\n\nThis decision wasn't made lightly. We've all thought and considered all the possibilities but it's honestly what is best for my daughter and the baby. Elizabeth is aware she was irresponsible but this baby isn't the suitable punishment. She is young, maybe a little dumb with her actions, but this is still her life and she knows she isn't ready for this. She's also starting her junior year of highschool in 2 weeks, which I could make a whole other post listening the problems and potential disasters that come with that. She is en-route to a good college with scholarships. She has dreams and plans that this inconvenient, accidental pregnancy just can't fit into.\n\nAnd as for my wife...she's extremely unhappy about the decision and left to go to her mother's house after the decision was finalized. Obviously neither of us are thrilled that she's so angry but that will have to be dealt with later. I'm calling the doctor's\n\nIf anyone has questions or concerns feel free to comment them\n",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone, \nI'll be cross-posting this in /relationships as I'm not sure which sub is more appropriate. \n\nI would like in advance to apologize for the long post but I think some background information is needed so you can assess the situation.\n\nMy wife and I have two kids. The oldest is turning 4 soon and the youngest is 7 months old. \n\nMy wife is a very strong beliver in the *attachment parenting* theory of raising children. \nSince our first child was born she has been co-sleeping with us. And ever since our sex life has been going down hill. \n\nNow since our youngest child was born he has also been sleeping with us in a queen sized bed. But after two months of very poor sleep, I decided I couldn't follow that arrangement anymore so I went to sleep on a sofabed in the next room. \n\nSo since our kids were born my wife has been sleeping with them and now I sleep alone. \n\nAs you could imagine, you can't really have sex with two kids on the bed. \nWe have gone weeks and even months without having any sex. \nSo my wife says that we should have sex in the sofabed where I sleep after she puts the children to sleep. \nThis to me sounds like making an appointment to have sex. Spontaneity isn't something you can have if you have to set up a time in advanced. I also miss cuddling with her and sleeping in a proper bed.\n\nAnd to be fair, my wife has complained that because I smoked pot after coming back from work or that because I drank beer on the weekend  (when we have the most available time) we were not having enough sex. \nWell, I've cleaned up my act and I stopped smoking pot and drinking any alcohol cold turkey. I've been eating healthy and exercising daily for the past 5 months, I lost 25 lbs and I'm in the best physical shape I have ever been in my life, but the sex situation has not improved. \n\nI feel like us sleeping in different rooms and beds has been the biggest hurdle to get back to the point we were before having kids. \n\nWe have a crib and a child's bed where each of the children could sleep separately but as I said she's into attachment parenting so if the children cry  (which I suppose they will when adapting to a new sleeping arrangement) is something that she wouldn't tolerate. \n\nI also I understand the 7 month old might need to be breastfed in the middle of the night so she says it's more convenient just to have him nearby in bed than having to get up to breastfeed him. But even if I were to suggest I could bottlefeed him mother's milk (which we have frozen) she would oppose as attachment parenting is about creating a secure attachment with the child and the act of breastfeeding supposedly strengthens that bond. \n\nAnyway, I'm almost at my wits, it's been quite a while without sex and I don't know what to tell her or do. \nWe have a lot of fights because of this. \n\nI feel that attachment parenting might feel like you're doing the best for the kids, but if it also ends up destroying the marriage and we separate what good would that do for them? \n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\ntl;dr **how do you improve marital sex life when one parent is a strong believer in attachment parenting, sleeps with the children in one bed, and the other parent sleeps separately in another room?**",

            "selftext": "My husband and I have always disagreed about whether to spank our kids. When our oldest was a baby, it was all hypothetical, and he (somewhat reluctantly) agreed with my perspective that we should not spank. My reasoning is that there is no other situation where it is appropriate to hit someone in order to obtain their compliance/obedience, so why is it okay to do so with a child? Both of us were spanked as kids, with different results-- he was unfazed, but I became fearful of my mom. So naturally, he is not as opposed to an occasional spank. \n\nNow that our daughter is almost 3, she's really testing us. She also has a new little brother who is 3 months old. Her behavior was INSANE when we first brought him home, but she's mostly returned to normal at this point. At this point, I think her increase of sassiness and defiance is a natural part of being her age rather than a reaction to her brother. We want to address it and teach her to be respectful, obedient, etc but disagree on the method in which to do so.\n\nA couple months ago, she started trying to run away from us in public, so I agreed that we could give her a smack on the hand if she did something very dangerous, like running from us or running towards the street. We have each done so once or twice, and it seems to have made an impression on her. She hasn't tried to run in maybe a month, which is great.\n\nNow my husband wants to spank her as a part of regular discipline, not just the dangerous situations. In fact, he \"popped\" her yesterday and told me about it afterwards, which upset me of course. He apologized for doing so without talking to me first but he said that he thinks we need to start spanking her. She is a sweet, funny, and extremely intelligent girl, but these days she is constantly pushing limits, directly disobeying, negotiating, being sassy/rude, and all kinds of behaviors that are not okay. I know it's normal but we do need to address them somehow before things get out of hand.\n\nShe's very energetic, and it's within the realm of possibility that she has ADHD-- I know she's too young for a diagnosis, nor do I want one at this age, but my husband has ADHD himself and she's wayyyy more energetic and wild compared to peers of her own age. So just out of curiosity I googled \"ADHD and spanking\" and came across this article: \n\nhttp://health.usnews.com/health-news/blogs/on-parenting/2008/06/09/one-view-a-spanking-might-beat-ritalin\n\nI know this is only one person's opinion, but now I'm confused. Maybe spanking is what she needs. I'm just not sure. If spanking her now will help her learn to control herself and avoid behavior problems in the future, maybe we should do it. I just can't get over the feeling that it's wrong to use physical discipline/hitting simply because she's my child. \n\nAm I overthinking this? I know there are studies about the detriments of spanking, but I've also heard that they typically study extreme cases of abuse and explosive, unpredictable discipline rather than controlled and rational spanking, so I don't know how relevant all of that is either. HELP\n\n**TL;DR-- Husband thinks it's time to start spanking our very strong willed 3-year-old. I have always been opposed to spanking but I'm reluctantly considering it.**",

            "selftext": "My wife asked me yesterday if she could take our 11 week old son (our first kid) on an extended four day weekend to his grandparents beach house two hours away. They'd leave Wednesday, I'd be expected to join them Friday. I had previously let her take him on a similar three day weekend around 6 weeks old and it turned out I I hated being apart from the baby. Reflecting on the prior experience with the three day weekend, I said no. \n\nUnfortunately, this caused my wife to erupt and sparked a huge argument. She is now accusing me of being controlling and manipulative and even abusive, because she does not feel it is acceptable for me to tell her she can't do something. I tried to clarify that I don't really think I can actually prohibit her from taking him away for two days but that it is my preference she does not. \n\nI work about 11 hours a day  I see my baby about ten minutes or less in the morning and about thirty minutes at night. Her argument is that she is \"stuck\" in our house all the time I am at the office and she just wants a chance to go to the beach and get a change of scenery and since she is suffering for 11-12 hours a day alone with baby, and I am only losing out a couple hours or seeing him, what's the big deal?\n\nTo her point, i replied that though I don't know how hard it is to be a breastfeeding mom, I am trying hard to support her and my only argument here is that I just want to see my son (and wife) when I come home. \n\nShe also says her parents should be able to see him.  I don't disagree.  They normally love three hours away but their beach house is only two hours away, so visiting at the beach is closer than their house. As a compromise I told her her folks can come here. This would eliminate the loneliness and get her some free time during the day. They're on a two week vacation to a beach house they own and go to every single weekend -- and they can get here in two hours.   I feel this solution helps everyone and i don't know why new first time grandparents wouldn't want to spend their vacation time this way if they claim that they want to see the baby.  Her and her folks see this offer of a four day beach weekend as a genius solution to my wife's loneliness and daily doldrums and think I am being completely bizarre to take issue with this notion. \n\nSince baby was born I have done nearly 95% of the chores, groceries, dishes, cooking, yard work, laundry, etc -- on top of my hugely stressful professional job.  I have not slacked and I am not going out socially.  I think it is fair that I get to ask she does not take him away like this but nothing I say can show her my viewpoint. She just sees it as an attempt to control her.  I don't think I'm doing that. I can't be sure but I think I'm one of the \"good guys\". I'm trying to be a great dad and husband. \n\nAm I overreacting to her request?  Is it normal that I don't want to be away from my son at this stage of his development?\n\nThank you all for any advice. ",

Some of these same people have had their children become bright red and/or blister from being outside thus summer.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? I realize some sunscreens are better for you and your skin than others. Some of these parents compare sunscreens to be on the same level as \"harmful\" vaccinations.\n\nAm I the only one constantly meeting these people this summer?",

My house was messy due to kids playing and since I am not too overly anal about the toys being over the floor I clean up when they are in bed. \nMy friend who has no children says 'I cant wait until i am a stay at home mum, I am going to have so much time of my hands, my house will be spotless, my kids will be well-behaved and I can binge watch Netflix' \nNow when I tried to explain that being a stay at home mum requires more work than a 9-5 job her response was (hold on to your horses mums &amp; dads) 'I had a week of work sick, the house was always clean and dinner was always cooked, so I  know what it is like'.\nAre you freaking kidding me!!!! If I had a week without any kids and was home my house would be clean too. \n\nBeing a stay at home mum is hard, you don't get to stop at 5pm and go home. Its a 24/7 job. It is also rewarding dont get me wrong but some days you wish you could crawl up into the fetal position with a bottle of wine and cry.\nwhen my toddler is asleep I do the things I am unable to do when she is awake. \nNetflix during the day is reserved for shows that she wants to watch, which is usually Brave on repeat or the entire wiggles season.\nWhen I clean the house when she is awake she walks behind me just to mess it up again as 'I want my toy there'\n\nWhen you become a parent and are the full time carer of that child your needs are Nil, my me time is the 5 minutes I get on the toilet which entails of a screaming child on the other end of the door, acting like her leg is being cut off with a rusty saw. \nMy showers are mostly with my toddler as she doesn't like baths and its easier to shower her with me. \nEven when she is in bed asleep you are still on the clock as any minute she can wake up screaming, but lets face it, it is always when you doze off that they wake up and they want to 'play' and takes a minimum of 2 hours to get back to sleep.\n\nI love my kids and wouldn't change being a stay at home mum, I just wish some acknowledged that it is harder that it is.

My daughter, whom I will call Karen, and I have a very Gilmore Girls-like relationship. We are very much bestfriends. I know it sounds weird to think that a 10 year old can be your bestfriend but she is. I didn't have Karen young, but we do have a lot in common like toy collecting, love animated/family movies and shows, love the same sort of music, arts and crafts, etc. Since my husband worked a lot when she was younger (not so much now), I spent more time with my kid, and I raised her with help from my stepson.\n\nAnyway, my daughter does have friends at school, and she spends time with them. I don't have many friends my own age, and the other mothers at school basically shun me. When I go to pick up Karen from school, they stand around, and gossip or talk about Quantico while I sit on a bench and read.\n\nWell, Karen's teacher called me and my husband in for a conference recently. She said she was concerned because, during a project, she named me as her bestfriend. Her teacher said that was abnormal, and that she has noticed that I don't talk to the other mothers much when I am around. She claims that this isn't healthy for Karen and that if I don't separate myself from her more, she will be forced to call Child Protective Services for an investigation.\n\nNeedless to say, my husband and I were shocked by this. I was also irritated by it. I don't think Karen is in any sort of abusive situation. I don't control her actions. I encourage her to make friends. We spend time together, sure, and we are pretty much bestfriends but Karen has other friends. I don't spent every waking hour with her.\n\nMy husband has suggested that I stop doing things with Karen to placate her teacher. I don't know... I started to distance myself from her these past few days, but it's obvious that it's affecting Karen and I. Karen's been spending more time at her friends' houses after school while I've been catching up on shows by myself. I went to see Captain America: Civil War with my stepson, but not her (she went with my sister and her kids). It's been tough, and Karen seems withdrawn.\n\nShould we continue to stay apart or just fight against what her teacher wants? What if her teacher does call CPS? ",

            "selftext": "TOP TEN OBSERVATIONS FROM A DAY IN KINDERGARTEN\n\nMy daughter\u2019s school participates in a program called WATCH D.O.G.S, which encourages dads to volunteer one day a year in their kid\u2019s school. Part of it is to bond with your kid and see what their day is like, the other part is to be a positive male role model for other students who don\u2019t have a lot of that in their lives, especially in elementary schools where 99% of the staff are typically female. These are my top ten thoughts and observations:\n\n1. The day started with a fire drill. Followed by a \u201clock down drill,\u201d which we didn\u2019t have when I was in school. All four classes piled into a single classroom and had to be absolutely quiet and still while the lights were off and the doors were locked. Scary to think about, but necessary in today\u2019s pre-Trump world.\n\n2. The \u201cstar student of the week\u201d brought a tablet for show and tell. Everyone got excited. He pulled out what looked to be one of those cheap LeapFrog devices. Kids started peppering him with questions\u2026\u201dcan you play Angry Birds or Crossy Road?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cCan you FaceTime?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d I felt bad for him\u2026.he was excited to show off his favorite toy and immediately got railroaded by the iPad posse. \n\n3. I spent most of my classroom time playing Chutes and Ladders with rotations of kids. They also had a card game called Line Up that\u2019s sort of like solitaire. My educational contribution was telling them \u201cthose upside down hearts are called spades\u2026.those clovers are called clubs. Tell your mommy you want to go Vegas for spring break.\"\n\n4. 10:45 AM \u2014 time to force feed myself lunch. I rarely finish my coffee before 11, much less have lunch. Made the rest of the day seem extra long. Also the kid sitting next to us didn't have a spoon for his pudding and was TERRIFIED to ask for one. SEINFELD REFERENCE #1: It was like asking The Soup Nazi for bread. YOU DON\u2019T HAVE A SPOON? NO PUDDING FOR YOU. NEXT!!! \n\n5. I\u2019m so glad I have girls. Boys would randomly do karate chops, push each other and try to stir up trouble. Also about half of them were wearing Star Wars shirts. I asked a couple what their favorite Star Wars movie is and they all answered that they\u2019re \u201cnot allowed to see the movies but watch the cartoons.\u201d Interesting. I told them that when they\u2019re older to skip the prequels and prepare for Slave Leia to make them feel funny inside. And not to get too attached to Han Solo.\n\n6. Was fascinating to see the gender differences in action. The teacher divided them up to turn geometric shapes into animals. The girls worked together, sharing ideas and encouragement. The boys turned into cavemen, arguing and fighting, grunting and growling. \n\n7. To paraphrase Jerry Seinfeld (reference #2) recess was like \u201crunning a blender without a top.\u201d Or a prison break. Pick your metaphor. One of the boys ripped my sunglasses off and refused to give them back. 33 years old and I\u2019m still getting bullied. I was going to tell him the truth about Santa, Tooth Fairy and Darth Vader if he didn\u2019t give them back. \u202a#\u200erevenge\u202c\n\n8. Post-recess, an urgent meeting was called for the entire grade. Apparently several of our \u201ckindergarten friends\u201d were picking up trash on the playground and putting it in their mouths. This was a deadly serious meeting, in which I had to bite my lip. Leave it to a teacher to turn a negative into a positive -- she\u2019s bringing work gloves and trash bags. \u201cIf you want to pick up trash, you can help clean up your playground instead of making your mouth dirty.\u201d Also, hide and seek and tag have been banned until further notice because \u201cseveral of our friends have been pushed and gotten hurt.\" #Yolo\n\n9. I participated in most of PE. Jumping jacks, squats, etc. Gym teacher said I was one of the few dads who\u2019s been able to touch their toes. #Winning I did, however, have to sit out yoga. Hard to do downward dog and candle pose in jeans.\n\n10. Teachers are really good actors. They run their classrooms like drill sergeants. I don\u2019t want to say mean...but definitely very strict. And they have to be to keep control. But then they would turn to me to chat and would be super sweet. It was a switch they could flip on and off. Never crossed my mind that teachers are playing characters. And after spending a day in their shoes, I have the utmost respect for who anyone who dedicates their lives to molding young minds....especially kindergarteners! \n\nThen we came home. And I immediately took a nap.\n\n\nNOTE: \"pre-Trump world\" seems to be getting a lot of attention in the comment cesspool below. Some context: I originally posted this on Facebook on March 2, the day after super Tuesday. \"Pre-Trump World\" was referencing the election results of the night before. When, after winning most (if not all?) of the Super Tuesday states, he was finally being taken seriously. It was the first time he was seen as a legit candidate for the nomination.\n\nSo March 1, day of my experience in kindergarten = \"pre-Trump world\"\n\nI meant no political statement by it. It was simply to represent a point in time. Although I agree it could be construed, tongue-in-cheekily, that Trump acts like he is going to fix everything, including the need for lockdown drills. But that wasn't my initial intent.",

First it was the Dr. Sears vaccine book and a standard MD pediatrician who hesitantly agreed to allow us to use the Sears schedule, then she found a special doctor who offered to (wink wink, nudge nudge) write a medical exemption from vaccination. \n\nNow she insists our child must go see a holistic (I.e homeopathic, naturopathic, chiropractic, whatever-opathic) doc. The infant mortality rate is so high, autism is rampant, childhood disease is rampant, everyone is walking around sick; she is utterly terrified. Our kid is doing great and has had zero issues from conception until now. \n\nI'm at my wits end and just want normal, science based, vaccinated medical care for our 4 month old. We are on the brink of divorce over this and we both want what we think (and in my case, what medical science thinks) is best for our kid.\n\nAdvice?\n\nEdits:\n\nSo far my 4 month old has received the following vaccines:\n\nDTAP - 2 doses\n\nMy wife has refused the following:\n\nRV - he won't get it and it's not that serious. Her antivaxx friend's son caught this and was vomiting nonstop for a week.\nPC - PC infection isn't that bad.\nHib - wants to space this out\nHepB - he isn't exposed to Hep B. Fair enough. \n\nShe has agreed that he can also receive the Hib next month. He will be three months behind on that. \n\nBeyond that, she wants to delay MMR to 3 years (despite evidence that delaying MMR doubles rate of febrile seizure). She wants to delay or refuse Polio, varicella, influenza, HepB and HepA. She wants to refuse boosters on DTAP after the second or third dose, and most of the boosters are questionable in her mind. \n\nWe do live in a state that requires vaccination for admission to public school, and does not allow philosophical exemptions. \n\nWe currently have no plan and the support of no physician (our pediatrician told us to catch him up ASAP) which is what concerns me the most.

            "selftext": "Nine years ago today my son Brendan was stillborn on his due date. I had made several decisions, out of ignorance and arrogance, that partly contributed to his death. \n\nI thought I knew more than obstetricians. I didn't want a hospital birth with interventions. I wanted control. So I got a doula. She convinced me a hospital birth would *not* give me control, that I *would* get an epidural, and a c-section would be likely. \n\nI know now this is all bullshit. Back then I just wanted what was best for my baby. I'd already had a miscarriage so I was really invested in \"doing everything right\". I didn't drink caffeine, took no unsafe drugs, didn't drink, didn't gain too much weight, exercised every day (but not too hard!). I was convinced this baby would be born OK.\n\nI decided to go with a birth center staffed by midwives, in my 7th month. They accepted me even though I was over 35, had never had a live birth, and had an auto-immune disorder (ulcerative colitis).\n\nAround 30 weeks, I began measuring small. But I was gaining a pound a week so they said everything was fine. by 34 weeks I was measuring *four weeks* behind. All they needed to do was refer me to hospital for an ultrasound. But they didn't.\n\nThe day before his due date, my son died in utero. Lack of amniotic fluid caused his umbilical cord to get blocked, and there were three blood clots inside. He fought - I felt it inside me but just thought he was unusually active for a spell - then he went quiet.\n\nIf Brendan had had a \"real\" doctor, chances are they would've caught the decline in amniotic fluid, induced early, and he'd be here today. Nine years old.\n\nIt took three more pregnancies but I finally had a live birth, a son who is now 6. He had the same issues with low amniotic fluid starting around 30 weeks but because I was now high-risk, he was monitored every other day and we induced at 37 weeks. He was born in a hospital with an epidural and he is totally normal, healthy, and probably my only real reason for living aside from my wonderful supportive husband. \n\nThere is a picture of me holding Brendan while my husband looks down at him. I am staring at the camera with this look of complete and utter rage in my eyes. That is the moment the hate began. I hate the woo-woo \"natural birth\" movement, I hate my doula, I hate my midwife and I really really really hate myself.\n\nOK, if you've made it this far thank you, I know this is hard.\n\nTL;DR I made bad decisions made on bad advice and my baby died. I hate myself and I miss him every day. How do I live with this? ",

Everything was neatly arranged and spread out in a vulgar display of purchasing power. The photos cropped up one after another in a childish game of \"Oh yeah? Well look what my kid got!\" We didn't go along with this shameful competition, and merely shared a photo of our son trying his first Peep. Long ago, we agreed to keep holidays and birthdays simple and dignified.\n\nIt wasn't like this when my wife and I were kids. We would get a basket of candy and maybe a small toy or plush bunny, and our parents took photos of grateful kids happily examining their goodies, not still-lifes of a gaudy array of consumer goods.\n\nAnyone else sick of all the showing off?

            "selftext": "So a bit of backstory 1st. I am a single father with a 16 year old daughter. When my daughter was 5 years old, her mother was killed. We have since then moved to one of the biggest cities in the USA, and sometimes I worry about her safety.\n\nAbout 3 years ago, A friend from my work suggested that I enroll her in a self defence class. After some reserch, and discussion with Lacy, it was decided that she would attend a Krav Maga class in the city.\n\nMy daughter loves the class, and it has helped her feel safer coming home from school, when she is out with friends, and really any time she is alone. I think the class has also helped her with her self esteem.\n\nA few days ago, there was an incident in school. She got into an arguement with a classmate, and the girl attacked her. witnesses and the school faculty both tell me that the girl in question is the one who initiated the fight, but my daughter is the one who ended it. \n\nThe girl ended up with a broken nose, an orbital fracture, and a dislocated shoulder. This is from getting put in some kind of armlock and getting put face 1st through a desk.\n\nWhen I met with the principle, and my daughter, when they told me she was being suspended, my daughter said that she was defending herself, and stopping her agressor swiftly and efficiently. That didnt help her situation.\n\nThe school basically told me that putting her in Krav makes me a horrible parent, and I should be ashamed.\n\nSo, I havent even decided if i should punish her for defending herself. This whole thing has me wondering if I really am a bad parent.\n\nEDIT. This is what happened as explained to me by my daughter\n\n\n**Her class was supposed to be watching a movie,(Lincoln). During the movie a girl who has been bullying her for a while started throwing things at her. She told the girl to stop. The teacher shushed them. The girl started throwing things again. She told her to stop again, this time more loudly.\nThe girl got up, and pushed her in the face, saying \"or what, are you gonna get your mom to haunt me?\". At this point My daughter stood up, because she knew the girl would start punching soon. My daughter said she backed away, and told the girl to just leave her alone.\nAt this point the teacher told them both to get back to their seats, or they were gonna get sent to the office.\nThe girl then tried to slap/punch her, she moved out of the way and pushed the girl back, she said \"Stop!, Im warning you\". Then the girl charged her, my daughter got hit once in the face. The next time the girl swung at her, she grabbed her arm and twisted it around to immobilize her. at this point the class was pandemonium. the girl still didnt stop, she tried to grab at my daughters hair, So she slammed her into a near by desk. The girl went down, she grabbed her face, with her one good arm, she was bleeding alot. My daughter said at this point she was crying a little, she was trying not to, but she couldnt help it.**",

            "selftext": "When I was 19, I got a girl pregnant, let's call her Jane, and our daughter, let's call her Emily, was born.  We tried to make it work as a couple, but it didn't work out.  Since then, I've had limited time with Emily.  \n\nFirst, her mother didn't stick to the custody agreement.  If it was my day to have Emily, Jane would often make up excuses like Emily was sick and the doctor told her to stay in bed.  Or there was some family event going on and everyone in her family wanted Emily to be there, or she was going to a sleep-over that weekend, etc.  I would get to have her maybe 2 weekends a month and the odd day here or there.\n\nNow, Emily is 13 and it's a struggle to get her to come over.  She'll scream and cry and either her mother will tell me to leave or I'll just get sick of it and give up.  It's only gotten better in the past year because one of her friends moved in down the street from me.  So she'll come with when I pick her up, but will disappear to her friend's house until her curfew.  When she is here, she just stays in her room.  \n\nEmily has always been cold towards me, but lately she's become just plain mean.  Her and her friend were watching a wedding on TV and I was in the room and out of nowhere she said, \"When I get married, Bill is going to give me away.\"  (Bill is her stepfather.)  Yeah, I constantly get compared to that guy.  He's very well-to-do, and I'm just a blue collar guy.  She mocks my intelligence and calls me a loser because I didn't finish college.  I would bring up the fact that I had to drop out to support her and her mother, but I don't think she needs to know that.  Basically, everything I do and everything under my roof is crap, and everything over at her house is awesome.\n\nThe worst was at Christmas this year.  This was only like the third time I was able to have her on Christmas.  We had a big family reunion.  I don't think I've ever been more embarrassed.  Every gift she got was crap.  \"I already have one of these.  This shirt coat is gross.  What am I going to do with this?\"  My 80 year old grandma, Emily's great grandma, spent an entire year making afghans for all of her great grand children.  Emily opened her's up and said, \"Really, a blanket?\"  \n\nShe spend the rest of Christmas break and her mother's and that's fine with me.  In fact, I want her to spend the rest of her life there.  I don't care to ever see her again.  At this stage, what's the point?  It's not like I'm abandoning her.  As she's said many times, Bill has been more a father to her than I could ever be.  And I just can't do it anymore.  I can't take the fighting.  I can't take her putting me down at every turn.  \n\nI really don't know what to do to save our relationship.  Actually, when I think about it, we've never really had a relationship.  I'm just the guy she was forced to go see for a few days a month, and the babysitter when her mother wanted time alone.  So I don't see a point in struggling with her anymore.\n\nI'm going to ask Bill if he wants to formally adopt her.  I don't know what's involved in that process, but I'm hoping he wants to.  \n\nIf he doesn't, then I guess she'll just be another bill I have to pay off each month, like the utilities or car insurance.  Can you get in trouble if you don't take your child on your custody days?  I don't really care I guess, because I'm done with her.  \n\nEither way, I want to make it clear that she is no longer welcome in my home.  I guess this makes me an awful person, but I think in the long run, we will both be better off.\n\nSorry for the rant.   \n\nEDIT-\nI just want to add a few things and clarify a few points.  And I want to say thank you to everyone who has responded. \n\n1.  Jane and I were never married.  She moved in with me after we found out she was pregnant.  Not that it's a big deal, but I've seen a few posts referring to her as my ex-wife.  I just wanted to clear that up.  We lived together for about 2 years and I came home from work one day and they were gone.  At that point, it was clear we weren't compatible, but I never expected her to just leave like that.\n\n2.  More about Jane.  She has made it perfectly clear that she has no interest in Emily and I having a relationship.  Punishments I make at my house don't transfer over to their home.  If Emily breaks curfew and I ground her, nothing happens when she goes back to her parents.  Yes, I tell Jane about it.  She couldn't care less.  \n\n3.  The counselling thing.  Yes, I could try to take her to a therapist while I have her, but she would just sit there and not say anything for an hour.  And again, talking to her mother about this would do no good.\n\nEdit #2.\nIn regards to punishment again, Emily doesn't care.  Let's say she breaks curfew or whatever.  Okay, so I ground her.  I take away her phone and everything.  To her, it's nothing because she knows she just has to ride out the weekend and she'll go back home and everything will be fine and it will be another two weeks before she has to deal with me.  What am I supposed to do?\n    ",

            "selftext": "Edit: TL;DR- Teacher made my son share his new personal pen set with other children in his class. The other kids have wrecked his pens despite him not wanting them to use them in the first place? Am I wrong for getting mad at the staff for this? \n\n=-----------------=-------------------=---------------------=\n\n\nToday my son (J) was picked up from holiday club (out of school playgroup) in tears. \nWe let him take his brand new box of felt tips from Christmas to holiday group with him because he wanted to draw while he was there, and he claims he didn't like the pens they supplied. Fair enough, so we put them in a little pencil case and dropped him off. \n\nApparently during the day some other kids wanted to play with his pens too, and he said that they couldn't, because they were *His* pens,  but that they could draw with him instead just using the club's art supplys instead of his own from home. \n\nWell, these other kids went crying to of the 'teachers' (Technically childminders) that J wasn't letting them use his pens, and the childminder went over to J and told him that he had to share his pens with anyone that wanted to use them, and that if he objected she would confiscate them. He didn't want her to take away his pens and reluctantly let the others borrow them too. \n\n\nI  looked in the pencil case to ensure he wasn't over reacting. From a 40 box of pens. Theres 27 left, and half are missing lids and most don't even have their nibs in place. :( \n\nNow. Don't get me wrong, these weren't exactly supreme copics markers or anything, they were just crayola felt tips bought in a sale for \u00a310. But it's the principal of that the teacher made him let the other kids use his own pens, which I don't think is right. We pay them to look after our children and to provide fun activities during the holidays while we work.  \n\nAm I over reacting to be angry at this? I mean, if it was the childminder's toys then obviously he should and would share them with everyone else, but these were his own pens that were destroyed by the other kids, and the minder just let it happen! \n\nMy husband just got off the phone to the minder and she basically told me that if he didn't want his pens too be used by the other kids he shouldn't have brought them. She does make a point but urgh. I just don't know if I'm doing right here by getting annoyed. \n\nWould you be annoyed? How would you deal with this. It's probably absolutely nothing, but this isn't the first issue we've had with this club but it's the only one for miles and can't afford to pull him out :( \n\n\nAdvice? How much Sharing is too much? Should every child get to play with every other toys?\n\n\n\n\"##############\"=-------------__\n\nEdit: \n\n\nJust to clarify some things I missed out earlier \n\n-The kids who borrowed the pens were aged 6/7 (the overall group age range is 3-10) \n\n- many of the other kids bring their own things from home, and as far as I'm aware are not expected to share if they don't want to \n-The group consists of about 13 kids on an average day between three on duty staff members, whom work on a rota between about 7 staff members. \n\n-I've had 'issues' with this particular childminder before, for example J forgot his coat on a group visit to the park on a swing and the teacher refused to return the 100yard walk to pick it up, I only found out when I picked him up without a coat and asked where it had gone. \n\n-The other issue was not letting J go to the toilet when he needed to during 'quite time' (kind of a nap time /reading time for the older kids who don't need to nap) and making him hold it uncomfortably for half an hour. other kids however are allowed to go as many times as they want, with no real explanation as to why J wasn't. This was the same individual childminder in all three incidents, and the only reason she gave me was 'he might wake up the other kids'. Which is valid but not really fair to have a 4 year old hold a full bladder for half an hour. \n\n\nIt's about 6 edits later and the formatting is still rubbish. You'll have to bear with me, I'm on mobile. \n ",

            "selftext": "***UPDATE***\n\nSo first off I want to say thank you to everyone who commented here whether you told me that I am an idiot drug addict or if you told me it'll all blow over so take another puff. I appreciated all the feedback! Secondly I also want to make a few things clear because I didn't go into detail about it when I posted. I packed up my bowl and lighters and gave them to my best friend to hold for me for the time being. Will they come back to the house eventually? Prolly. I wasn't ever doubting that CPS could take my kid away from me, I just felt it wouldn't escalate to something like that. Like most of the commenters said I had a conversation with my daughter. I was open and honest and asked her what she was most worried and upset about. She told me that she didn't want me to die or go to prison. I told her that neither of those things would ever happen and that my #1 priority would always be keeping myself, her, our pets, and home safe. Luckily we have been watching a PBS documentary about prohibition so she is pretty familiar with the concept. I used that as my example. Told her how states are attempting to legalize it. I told her that, like alcohol, it isn't okay for kids to use. And its an adult choice that you are allowed to make. I did fess up and say that it is NOT legal in our state but a lot of people are working to make it legal. She asked why (for both) and I did try to explain the best i could. I told her you cant overdose on MJ and that when I did use it was very little and it helped me sleep and relax. I told her that it was wrong of me to do it when I know that it is illegal and I made a bad decision in that way. I talked about how DARE in the classroom lumps all drugs together and it sounds very scary. I assured her that it isn't as scary as her class made it sound and I did apologize for upsetting and scaring her when that is the last thing I ever want to do. I also made sure to let her know that snooping thru a parents belonging is WRONG. And not okay. I told her that this time there is no punishment for it but adults have things and do things that kids aren't able to understand and there are reasons why certain things aren't laying around the house. She seemed very understanding and like it clicked that I wasn't going to drop dead on her. I think she was scared because our area has had numerous (I'm talking about 15) heroin overdose deaths in the last 3 months. (we live in a town of 2500!) She really thought I was going to die. Any. Minute. She knows that it is illegal and wrong and I reiterated that I wasn't making excuses of why it is right for me to do it. I know I broke the law and that is not okay. I honestly feel so much closer to her after this. We had a talk for about 2 hours tonight and I got her insight into a lot of other topics during this conversation as well. She told me that she felt sorry that she freaked out and that she said things to hurt my feelings and I again apologized to her for making her feel scared and upset. All in all I appreciate everyones input and thank you all again for taking time to help me OR judge me, whatever the case may have been! THANKS REDDIT!\n\nOriginal Post:\nThis will probably get me blasted from a lot of people, but I smoke pot. I smoke pot after my daughter (10) is in bed. I get high and watch netflix before I myself go to bed. It helps me relax. It helps me sleep, and it helps me clear my mind. I don't smoke all day everyday. I smoke at night only when my kid is in bed. I keep an old camera box in my underwear drawer and that is where i put my bowl and my stash. She must have been snooping as i am not sure why she was in my underwear drawer and completely freaked out. She was crying and yelling, and of course she is in D.A.R.E. this year and has been taught that marijuana is pretty much on the same level as meth or heroin. She literally said to me, \"how do you think a kid should feel when they find out there mom is a drug addict?!\" I have no idea what to do. Shes at school now and I need to know what to say. We are in an illegal marijuana state (meaning recreational and medical marijuana is still banned.) I don't want to encourage the use of majiuana but i also want her to know I'm not a drug addict. We have a house, I pay all the bills, and she wants for nothing. I feel ashamed and embarassed and I've now let my little princess see that I am not wonder woman... She says she no longer trusts me. What do I do here guys?! Any help would be appreciated...",

I wake up and treat the house like a job, and I'm employee of the month. \n\nThere's a stigma about stay at home dads. I've heard it all, especially from family. \"You're the man of the house. You need a job.\" Straight up, you're right. And I've just landed myself the sweetest gig on the planet. Rocking out all day with my little girl. I've made a living my whole life and for the first time I feel like I'm actually living. Sure, I don't get a paycheck, but I get to spend stupid amounts of time with my princess. \n\nThe wife has accepted a full time position. She had cabin fever something silly. I knew that she was ready to get back out there and earn and she couldn't be happier. We've basically switched roles. And it's radical. I do the fuck out these dishes. I suit up and kill the laundry monster every morning. I flipped that pantry on its head and instituted a system that ensures we don't go without. And I get to do it all my way. Shit, I'm a manager out here.\n\nHow does the wife feel? You've never seen a woman so turned on by a man scrubbing kitchen floors. She says \"They can keep their sweaty football players, mechanics, and models. I'm all about that apron.\" lol And she's happy. She has a newfound confidence, waking each day and dressing to impress. She feels like a member of the community again. Not just an employee to a \"three year old terrorist\" she says. \n\nI know that most guys would rather go out and get the money. I was the same way, even as I accepted my new role. But I quickly realized that life is short and I love my family. I set my stupid man shit on the shelf and had a tea party while it collected dust. I'm a dad. And I'm good at it. \n\nSo, to the dads out working jobs and the dads at home working just as hard. Remember that time=love. Time spent earning or time spent raising is time for your family. Whatever you're doing, do your best and own it.",

            "selftext": "Sorry it's been so long. It's been a rough one. Original thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/3oukfe/took_our_daughter_to_the_hospital_and_now_they/)\n\nI'm gonna tell the whole story and then I'll address you guys' concerns  from the first thread if the story itself doesn't explain them.\n\nYesterday at 1:30pm I picked up our daughter from my wife's parent's house. They are her caregivers while my wife and I are at work. She acted normal the rest of the day and we put her to bed with no problems at 8:30. At 8:25, a friend of my wife (we'll say Amanda) came over to watch a movie with us. \n\nBaby woke up at 10:30 crying (which was weird) and when I picked her up she immediately started rubbing her face on my chest back and forth as if she had a perpetual itch. When I would set her down, she would go into a downward dog position and scoot her face across the floor (this was REALLY weird, she chooses not to crawl anymore as she has mastered walking/running). We thought maybe it was a headache/ear infection or something, so we gave her some children's acetaminophen. \n\nMy wife went out with Amanda to party while I tried to put the baby to sleep, because while we recognized the symptoms as weird, we didn't think they were serious. I tried every normal thing, rocking her, feeding her (she wouldn't eat), etc, and she kept doing the same weird things. \n\nI tried to put her in the crib to let her cry it out, which seemed to work... she would get quiet only to cry 20 min later. This happened twice. I texted my wife to come home because it was 1:30am and I had to wake up at 4 to go to work. She came home, I fell asleep, my wife tried to console her to no avail and then rushed to the hospital. \n\nI got to work at 5 and immediately had someone cover me. I get to the hospital to find out they've taken blood and ran a CAT scan. They were waiting for her to pee so they could get a urine sample. Once she did, they tested it and we waited.\n\nA cop walked in the room and I immediately got uncomfortable and somewhat aggressive toward him (I *really* don't like cops). \"Why are you in here\" \"Why do you need my ID\", etc. He only said \"I'm just here to check your baby's well-being\" He stayed in the room and sometime later the pediatrician came in and did some vitals checks (temp, ear, mouth, etc) and then said the drug screen showed \"meth\" (\"meth\" is the word she used). My wife broke down and started freaking out, assuming they would take our baby away. I denied the allegation several times, and after she left the room I googled what medications might cause a false positive. CPS was called.\n\nWhen CPS got there we told her basically what I've typed here and they gave us a drug test. My wife's came back negative, and the CPS worker kept looking at mine and saying \"it's trying\" (I think she *really* wanted to find drugs in my system), but it came back negative as well. They immediately changed their tone and started asking us about Amanda, my wife's parents, etc. They asked me if I would show them our apartment and I said yes, so we drove over there, they came in, took some pictures and said \"wow there's nothing, we're completely baffled\" I said \"Imagine how I feel!\" They said they'd talk to their supervisor to find out what to do next (apparently they'd never encountered drug-free parents with a meth-baby). \n\nI went back to the hospital and they moved us to the pediatric ward (with comfier chairs!). On our way, CPS called me and said our local police wanted to do a dog search in our apartment. I *very* reluctantly agreed (I know, I know, 4th amendment, blah blah don't talk to cops without a lawyer; but what would have happened I'm guessing is they would have taken my baby while they waited for a judge to sign a warrant, just to find nothing, which I was sure they would). I head over there to find the cops waiting. They first start reading a cell phone search consent form (they got pretty far before realizing their mistake). They went back to the car to get the right form, and ended up filling that one out incorrectly too (fucking incompetent assholes). They searched our apartment and found nothing. They told me after \"It must have gotten in her system somehow. Be suspicious of everybody\" No thanks, I think I'll keep my optimism. \n\nI went back to the hospital and my wife and I waited around, they pulled blood a couple more times in the next 6 hours. We had some family come in so we could maybe get some sleep in. No more accusations were thrown, but it looks like there actually was some narcotic in my child. The nurses did what they could to reduce symptoms. \n\nWe are home now and my baby seems mostly back to normal.\n\nNow to answer concerns:\n\n**Meth house:** We did rent our place but we've been here over a year with no problems. Plus, I think the drug dog would have found something.\n\n**Suspicious House Guests:** Amanda was the only guest in the last week, and turns out she works with kids where regular drug tests are done. I was suspicious at first, but I think we can rule her out. Her, myself, my wife, and my wife's parents are giving hair follicle samples tomorrow\n\n**Re-test/lawyer up:** I did immediately ask for a re-test, but like I said, they ended up re-testing throughout the day. We are poor and cannot afford a lawyer or even have the time to deal with one (we're both full time). turns out it wasn't necessary.\n\n**Family drugs**: The only drug regularly taken in this house is my wife's birth control. They stay in her purse and our baby could not get into them if she tried. The only other drugs we have are cold/flu, and these are locked in our bathroom.\n\n**Tainted Formula:** I can't imagine this would be the culprit, but we threw it out anyway\n\n**Wife sneaking drugs behind my back:** Wow, just wow\n\n**Not a false-positive:** a few people in the original thread suggested that, given her symptoms, it might not have been a false-positive. as I said, it looks like my baby *actually did* get some narcotic in her system. No one can figure out how. My ideas are: community washers/dryers we use, former meth house idea, shared ventilation with other apartments\n\n**Try \\/r\\/legaladvice:** I was freaking out and just chose the first subreddit that came to mind. turns out I didn't need legal advice anyway.\n\nThank you, everyone, for the support. \n\nEdit: I'm gonna sleep now. I'll try to answer any questions tomorrow.",

            "selftext": "I am really in a tough position right now and would really like some support...I have come here because I feel very uncomfortable discussing this with anyone I know personally. I have an 18 year old daughter. She is extremely intelligent, imaginative, and unique. She excels at whatever she chooses to do and she is the absolute sweetest daughter I could ask for. She was very mature as a child, but it seems as she is getting older she is not \"growing up\"! I encourage her to go out and be independent but she has no interest. Here are the things that worry me:\n\n1. She does not have any friends (nor does she have any interest to!) and likes to spend time either alone or with me\n\n2. She is very afraid of being home alone or in the dark\n\n3. She spends most of her free time playing (yes playing! As in the activity children partake in....for example: coloring, playing with stuffed animals, playing house, talking to imaginary friends, reading picture books, watching young children's cartoons)\n\n4. She buys all her clothes in the children s aisle, and does not want to look \"grown up\" even though she is a very pretty girl. In fact she has always refused to shop anywhere but the children's isle\n\n5. She is dreads going to college and is putting off applying anywhere..she does not want to go to college so she can stay home and continue her life as it is (she does not need to worry about money....fortunately for her we have a very good situation monetarily)\n\n6. She drinks out of sippy cups and likes using her old childhood plastic dishes..\n\n7. She does not like to do anything grown up...she won't watch grown up movies because she thinks they are not appropriate for her. She has never done any rebellious teenage stuff, she has no interest in having a boyfriend or anything of the sort\n\n8. She does not go anywhere by herself...I go with her to all of her appointments, and she acts like a helpless 10 year old by herself\n\nI have tried to bring this up with her before, but she just looks so hurt and tries to tell me that shes just different and she is really happy being like this.  She tells me that she never wants to grow up and is scared of the \"real world\" because it would never accept her how she is.\n\nThe hard part for me is how sweet she is...she is just really a genuine girl without a mean bone in her body. She is kind to everyone and just happens to act like a whimsical 10 year old instead of her age I just worry for her....what should I do? Her father is no longer in the picture so I am alone with this.",

            "selftext": "Although this is my first post on /r/parenting, I've been reading posts on the site for a while. During that time, I've read a lot of posts from parents of newborns and toddlers which have reminded me of my own experiences during those extremely precious years. Those posts have also shone a light on the disappointment I feel at how my own kid has turned out. My son is 24. He has never had a job and barely lifts a finger at home. He has made it abundantly clear that he doesn't want to do anything with his life except sit on his ass all day playing stupid, pointless video games. He's a hermit and has a deathly, pale pallor because he spends so much time holed up in his room, not getting any sunlight. He has no mental or physical disablement, so he has no excuses for being the way he is. He also doesn't smoke, drink or take any drugs. He is just extremely lazy. Other family members stopped asking about him a long time ago, presumably because they are trying to protect my feelings. He has steadfastly refused to do anything to improve his life despite strenuous effort and encouragement on my part. This has been the status quo for a while now. That's the gist of the situation, but there is more that I would like to get off my chest.\n\nWhen my son was born, and in the years that followed, I wasn't really thinking about what the future would look like for him 20 years down the line. I was focusing on enjoying every single moment I spent with him. He was very much a happy, smiling baby. He hit all of his milestones very early. I knew that one day he would have to grow up and find his place in the big, bad world as an adult. I am sure that most parents understand that is what is supposed to happen. If I had known he would turn out the way he has, I honestly don't know if I would have continued with the pregnancy. Also, I once read a post on /r/parenting that said you can't shape your kids, you can only equip them. I myself tried to do both of those things to the best of my ability, yet this is what I ended up with. An outright failure. I've seen plenty of stories on reddit and elsewhere from parents whose kids have completely gone off the rails. They often mention illicit drug use, underage drinking, sex, trouble with the police and related misdemeanors. These stories all seem to share a common ending - the kids in question are now thriving, have good jobs, families of their own and are functioning as successful members of society. I often wonder what happens to the ones who don't have happy endings. Do the parents just stay in silence and never tell anyone?\n\nI don't know what it would take for any of that to happen with my kid. I can't send him off to one of those wilderness camps for unruly teenagers, because he's an adult. He probably wouldn't go unless he was forced to anyway. Does a person need to hit rock bottom before they change? I don't know what it would take at this point. I worry that one day he will eventually wake up and realise he has to change, but it will be too late. I'd also like to ask you all - when this kind of situation arises, is it always the parent's fault, without exception?",

            "selftext": "Tldr: has anyone else faced a situation where a spouse is doing something stupid and dangerous but believes he is being helpful? \n\nI have a weird problem. My husband is completely cowed by his mother. She is emotionally abusive and my husband can't stand up to her. As is always the case with her type of crazy, my MIL hates everyone my husband dates. One of the ways she expresses that hatred is by criticizing me and insisting that my husband do things her way. \n\nMy husband mostly ignored her until our daughter was born. Then something about being an insecure, sleep deprived new parent triggered a massive mommy rebound. \n\nAnd my MIL, of all the things to question me on, has decided that I am \"over feeding\" our newborn. Because, she claims, I had a rough childhood and so I want to overstuff my daughter. And she thinks my daughter will get fat. \n\nDid I mention my daughter is two months old? \n\nI cannot explain the rage this triggers in me. My MIL is criticizing my family, my personality, my ability to parent my child... AND SHE WANTS MY NEWBORN TO DIET. \n\nI want her dead. I want my husband to go to counseling. Neither of these things are going to happen immediately. (Although she is 70 so fingers crossed - sorry not sorry). \n\nIn the meantime, I had the pediatrician's office give us written instructions with the amounts my daughter needs to eat. That worked for a while. But this week my husband talked to his mother again. Now he's getting right back into his old ways. \n\nI tried to take over the feedings (we breast feed and pump but also have to supplement because, shocker, my daughter wasnt gaining weight during the time I was letting my husband feed her unsupervised). But my husband gets upset. \n\nOther than believing his IDIOT of a mother, he is a wonderful father. \n\nObviously his mother is never allowed near our daughter without me. And obviously we need counseling. \n\nBut how would you be respectful of your husbands childhood trauma here? He isn't trying to be a bad guy. He's just unable to give his mother the skepticism she deserves. And his mother is unable to gain a clue or the ability to behave herself in my house. \n\nBoth of them think they're right. And they're both willing to feed my daughter 10 ounces a day or \"whatever she wants....\" Mysteriously, my daughter is starving  whenever I feed her. \n\nI feel like my MIL is at least well-intentioned toward my daughter - she obviously wants my husband to divorce me, but she also honestly believes her moronic advice is the best. Because she's a moron. \n\nSo no one is being mean, but their collective stupidity is endangering my daughter. And that makes me VERY mean. The harder I push the more nervous my husband gets, and then of course he turns to his mother for advice... And it's a vicious circle because the woman is just dumb. She gives bad advice (she also wanted desperately to give my newborn plain water, and told me I was being \"neglectful\" by letting my 8 day old sleep the recommended 16 hours a day). She won't change and she can't be trusted.\n\nTldr: Has anyone else faced a situation where a spouse is doing something totally stupid and dangerous, but  thinks he/she is being helpful? ",

I wonder if Topham put down his fistful of scones long enough to threaten their families.\n\n\nAlso, Sodor has a really weird economy. I'm strongly reminded of North Korea. \"Special, important visitors\" get to see what Topham wants them to see.

My wife is the only one who can comfort her when she wakes up and get her back to sleep (believe me, I've tired to soothe the kid numerous times). As a result of being up constantly, working full time, and all the other household chores, my wife is extremely exhausted. I'm trying to do all I can to help. Whenever I ask her what I can help with, I get 'I don't know'. She has to have everything perfect in the house. She wants Toys picked up and put away, while I'm like can't we just leave them on the floor. She is irritable and stressed out all the time. I don't know what to do to make the situation any better. It is putting a strain on our marriage. I suggested letting our daughter 'Cry it out' in hopes that she would start sleeping through the night. This was met with an angry 'NO'.

I am glad he called me, I don't think he would have called me if I hadn't have made this arrangement but now I don't know what to do.\n\n\nHis friends are nice kids (maybe not as nice as I thought) but are always polite and courteous. My son told me he was sleeping at a friends (Dave) house with his girlfriend Amber and was  going to a house party with them. What happened as far as I understand is that they decided to try heroin at this house party.. They then decided to leave with the dealer. They ended up at a horrible house with the dealer. He was ranting and raving and they were really scared and didn't know how to get out of the situation. They had more drugs here (Luke won't tell me what, he says he doesn't know). But Luke says they made him feel almost paralysed. The dealer was hitting on Amber and they were all terrified. Luke texted me his location and asked me to come get them. I did. When I got them Amber couldn't walk and I had to carry her. \n\n\nThey slept it off at my house and all seem very thankful and scared straight. They were all vomiting when I got them.  But I feel like I have a obligation to tell their parents.. This surely wouldn't be the first time they have tried drugs. And knowing that this happened I will definitely be more watchful of Luke. I worry if I don't tell their parents they won't be able to help their children make the right choices. but I also promised Luke. I worry that if I break his trust he won't call me again if he needs help and something worse will happen. He is very thankful to me and we had a big talk about how drugs are bad and he was open and honest with his past drug use. He said he never wants to do drugs again after this last experience. I honestly believe him.\n\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n\nUpdate here \n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/3j58jx/update_i_went_and_picked_my_son_and_his_friends/",

Distance?  \n\nI used to leave my toddler in the car at the gas station to run inside to throw money on the pump.

            "selftext": "Edit2/update:  ****We got help today.  Pediatrician, National advice-only hotline, then child protective services, brief call to suspect only to tell her to cease all attempts to see us or contact us, and also went to police. Sincerely, thank you all for your comments and prayers.  It remains to be seen what the bureaucracy will do.  There is no physical evidence (exam revealed no tearing, bruising, etc.) and with the only accuser being age 2, all agencies consulted have made statements reflecting how little they will be able to do.  CPS said since I am preventing (abuser's) further access to the children, the case does not meet their guidelines for further action.  So all depends on law enforcement (they will refer to a special child unit that uses dolls and playtime to interview victims) and, of course, God. We will NEVER leave a child alone with this person for a second, not even in the next room.  We will call a local nonprofit counseling agency tomorrow morning.***\n\nI suspect my mom of repeatedly molesting my infant daughters.  It is entirely possible that I am crazy (it runs in the family) so I could be mistaken.  My list of suspicions is below. My questions are: Who do I call and what happens if I do?  Will my kids be taken away? Will my mom (my kids' only living grandparent) go to jail?  Would that make it better or worse for my kids, considering everyone would find out? What if she is innocent and my suspicious mind is about to ruin our family relationships?  Details:\n\n1) Today in the bathroom my 2 year old told my wife that her vagina \"hurts.\" She said, \"Grandma hurt me.\" My wife asked \"how?\" and my daughter answered by holding up a pointing finger, as if to say she was hurt in the vagina with a finger. My wife says she did not prompt her, but only asked, \"What's the matter?\"\n2) My 7 year old daughter was in the room and freaked the hell out, screaming, \"No she didn't!! I was there the whole time! She fell! She hurt her vagina when she fell!\" What the heck kind of reaction is that?  My instinct is that she was told to lie.\n3) We have frequently noticed that when grandma babysits, there will be diaper rash. Sometimes the vaginal area is red, raw, irritated-looking. On my older daughter, when she was a baby, one time her vagina opening was large, like someone had reamed it out with a finger or two.  My wife and I convinced ourselves we were crazy or mistaken and told no one.\n4) Older daughter lies about every little thing, even very trivial matters.\n5) Older daughter's emotions are always on edge. She cries, screams at us, and does not seem to act her age. Lies, sneaks and hides food, cries every single day between 2 and 5 times. Tantrums at age 7. Slams doors like a teenager.\n6) Older daughter once got very upset when we explained the private nature of her body and asked if anyone at school, Sunday school, or in the family had ever hurt her or touched her in a way that made her feel bad. She lost it and said that if we talked about that, then someone would come and take her away and make her live in a different house.\n7) For past 7 years we have dealt with our suspicions by telling ourselves that it is totally unbelievable that a woman would do that, that an elderly 67 year old woman would do that, that my mom would do that to anyone, especially to her own grandkids.  Considered moving out of state and not giving anyone our new address. Decided instead to prevent one-on-one time.  Grandma has exhibited a pattern of seeking out one-on-one time, volunteering for diaper duty and rushing away with the baby so that we have to follow her. She complains that we do not come over or let her babysit often enough. She repeatedly demands to be on the school's list of \"authorized to pick up child\" for the older one (she is not on the list).\n8) I walked in on an odd scene: grandma watching TV in bed, laying down, giving my then-5-year-old daughter a bouncey horsey ride directly on grandmother's crotch, while both laughed. If this was innocent, why did mom practically throw my daughter off of her when she saw me walk in?  On that weekend, mom asked to have my daughter spend the night in her room. She whined and manipulated and pleaded, making me say no four times.\n9) Our 2 year old has been crying a lot lately.  She eats almost nothing now and likes to find quiet corners where she can be alone. At mealtime she goes behind her bed and cries loudly for 10 minutes and won't answer any questions. That is why my wife asked her what was the matter today, because she seems to cry \"all day.\"\n10) Mom and I have never been emotionally close, but I have 10 good reasons to suspect that she is a closeted lesbian who had many female \"friends\" including a years long romantic and sexual relationship with her own first cousin. I am not equating homosexuality to pedophilia, merely noting that it is logical to me that my mom would be sexually interested in females.\n11) Another family member has told me a 2nd hand rumor that my mom was abused by my uncle when they were kids.  Supposedly my uncle repeatedly violated both his sisters, and my mom held down the little one so he could. And the little one cried and screamed for her mama, who never came and must have known and allowed it. I take that with a grain of salt because the story was told by the little one (my aunt) when she was 50 and in a mental health facility against her will.\n12) My 7 yr old has stated that no one loves her, no one likes her or listens to her, that it would be easier to be dead, and that she cannot wait to get out of here when she turns 18.\n\nWhat should I do?\nA) Confront mom? Maybe she is innocent and will convince me?\nB) Call the police?\nC) Call child protective services?\nD) Cut off all contact with mom?\n\nEdit: Thanks for all comments. Would also like to hear from anyone who has dealt with police or CPS on something similar.  Just read my state agency's website and am freaked out. They may determine that we \"failed to protect\" her. Also concerned a doctor may want an invasive exam, further injuring/traumatizing, while we standby by and tell the child to allow it. Damn. Feel like moving across the country and trying to forget.\n\nEdit2/update:  please see top of this original post for the conclusion. Thanks again, so so much!!",

Excited from day 1, always visiting with presents, happy to send time with her and hand her back etc. My daughter thinks the world of her and they're very close. \n\nSister is an attorney and making very good $$$$$. Extravagent spending on my daughter is nothing new, she does all her school work on an aunty gifted macbook, carries one of those overpriced Herschel bags thanks to Aunty, saw One Direction on a VIP package thanks to Aunty etc etc. \n\nBut now comes this. \n\nMy sister got my daughter in that 'Eurovision Song Contest' thing. They're both fucking obsessed with it. The 'Eurovision Weekend Sleepover at Aunty X's' has been a thing for a decade and they're both obsessed with it. \n\nMy sister finally got time off in May to go to the damn concert thing after trying for 'six fucking years' in her own words. Her friend who was always going to go with her is pregnant is not able to go. \n\nSister called me tonight and excitedly explains she's finally got 10 days off in May to go to this song thing in Sweden and that she'll spend a couple of days in London and a couple of days in Copenhagen before going off to Sweden for it.....and can she take my daughter with her. \n\nI pause and sister quickly interjects with 'oh don't worry about money, I've got it, it's fine, think of it as an early 18th birthday present' (Daughter's 18th will a few weeks later) but it's not that. It's something my sister can easily afford. \n\nI'm a bit reluctant to have my daughter out of school for 7 school days in May during the Australian school year when my daughter is going to be in year 12 (senior year here) and towards the end of a school semester. \n\nI told my sister I'll get back to her with it. \n\nI expected my wife to say the same thing about schooling, but she said how out daughter has never been overseas before and she'll have an amazing time and it's a once in a lifetime chance. I said not really because the singing thing happens every year, but when I texted my sister she said there's not guarantee she'll get the time off again and someone like Russia or Ukraine could host the 2016 version and that my daughter has always wanted to go to Sweden anyway.\n\nNow me and my wife are completely divided. I think the school year needs to be her priority, not running off to watch some song contest towards the end of term, wife thinks we should let my sister take her. We have no need to be concerned about anything happened through my sister's negligence, she's pretty responsible, the only thing that might happen is she'll probably spoil her a bit too much with souvenirs. \n\n**tldr: My sister wants to take my 17 year old daughter from Australia to Europe for 10 days next May for Eurovision.

Let's keep the comments civil.\n\nWe have two small kids, one is 3 and one is 7 months.\n\nI know being a sahm is tough.  the kids are hard to deal with sometimes, but that's not the issue.  My wife has family in town: her parents, two sisters and two brothers.  Every single day she goes over to one of their houses mid morning and hangs out there until I get out at 5.\n\nI work two jobs.  One part time at home and one retail job.  Total weekly hours are around 60.  I usually work 5-5 or 6-5 and needless to say, I'm tired when I get home.  And I know with kids at young ages, the house will never be immaculate and I don't need it to be.  But when there are toast crusts sitting on the counter for 3 days, I get a little irked.  Or when there's no laundry done and I have to do it, I get irked.  Its not that I don't want to help around the house.  I do dishes and change diapers daily, among other things, but I feel like its her job to do that stuff while I'm at work and instead of doing it, she's off having fun with her brothers and sisters.  I'm glad she's having fun and enjoying life, but I'm busting my ass everyday to provide for our family and I'd appreciate it if she chipped in a little more.  I cook dinner nearly every night.\n\nShe's very sensitive.  If I try to offer constructive criticism, she takes it in the worst way and feels like I'm knocking her.  I just want to gently and tactfully ask her to do more around the house.  She's been a sahm mom for 3 years now and we've always kinda had this routine.  Just the past year I picked up the second job because we couldn't make our bills.  So it's partly my fault for letting us get into this routine.\n\nI know she needs social interaction, but there's gotta be a way to balance it all.\n\nCan anyone offer some advice?  How can I tactfully ask her to stay at home more and do work around the house instead of going out and having fun at her sibling's houses?  Please keep on mind she's very sensitive.\n\nI'm starting to get resentful of her.  She's off having fun and goofing around with her siblings while I'm busting my ass for 12 hour days to keep the bills paid.",

            "selftext": "Two (1,5?) weeks ago my kids (2 year old daughter and 3 year old son) went hiking. We followed a path that went very deep into a forest and we came across a little beach type of place. It's really small and there were maybe 10 people there. From 8 am to 2 pm there is a lifeguard (although he labels himself as security) there since it belongs to the city's regional parks and otherwise it is unsupervised. \n\nObviously we had just come from hiking and I didn't have the kids swimsuits, so when they asked me if they could go into the water, I said that I'd see. When we got closer and I saw that it didn't go deeper than my 2 year old's stomach for a good 6 meters, I told myself I'd pull up my pants and go 2-3 meters in and watch the kids from there. So I agreed to let them in and told them to remove their shirts and pants, to only keep their undies and to jump in! Which they gladly did. \n\nThey were playing in the water for about 3 minutes when the life guard comes by and asks me if my daughter has a top. I told him quickly that this wasn't planned, that her swimsuit does have a top but that I didn't have it with me. He replied something about it not being a nudist or topless beach and that she needed a top, so that maybe I could put her shirt on?\n\nI wasn't entirely sure that he was kidding or not... I mean, he was really young looking (16-18?) and he was dressed with baggy shorts and a long t-shirt (definitely not ready to jump in the water if someone drowns) and I don't know... I thought it might have been a joke. So I asked him \"really?\" He said, yes, really... So I got worked up and told him \"what does my daughter's chest have that my son doesn't?\" So he said \"well.. uh, you know... Women have breasts...\" To which I replied \"Yes, women do, once they reach puberty, right now she's just a little girl with nipples, everyone has nipples, boy or girl.\" He looked at me and just said \"Okay, she cannot stay in the beach like that.\" \n\nAt that point I was really pissed, probably to the point where I couldn't even watch them properly in the water, so I told them that we're going to get going. After a bit of \"but mommmmyyy I want to playyy\" we got dressed and going. \n\nI didn't go back for a while since there is also another beach nearby (but further and much busier) but then we went hiking yesterday and the kids asked if we could stop by the beach. I mean, this time around I decided to plan ahead and to bring their  swimwear (both have shorts and a t-shit- surf style) as well as mine. \n\nWe got there, the kids had their swimwear on already and they just took off their shoes and socks and jumped into the beach. I was taking off my dress when the same lifeguard came by. He said that he had spoken to his manager and that we weren't allowed on the beach, that they take child pornography very seriously. Again, I thought he was kidding. Like, seriously, what.the.hell? So I told him \"You better be kidding.\" And he says \"Please don't make me call for back up.\" Now, there were like 5 people at the beach, they were all staring and even the kids weren't even in the water and just wondering why mommy was getting upset. My 3 year old even asked \"Mommy, do we have to go again?\" And it just made me feel really upset, and I asked him, in a calming voice, \"Can I please have the number of your manager and his name?\" He said he didn't have it on him and I told him that I'd go ahead and wait while he called him. So I got undressed and went into the water to watch the kids.\n\nWhat he ended up doing was to call the other \"security people (3)(who are also 16-18 looking- obviously summer jobs)\" and they told me that I had to leave or that they would have to escort me out of the park. \n\nMy kiddos didn't need that type of stress, I didn't want to argue, so I politely asked for the manager's number again, and one of the guys said \"I am the manager, and I just asked you to leave.\" So we got dressed and we left. \n\nToday, 24 hours later, I am definitely upset. We are in July, it's nice outside, that beach is at 25 minutes from out house, it's not busy and yet, I cannot go there for really stupid reasons. I feel like I cannot reason with them and except writing to the newspaper or some type of media, I have no other idea what to do. \n\nMy husband says to just go there after 2 pm (and we have gone as a family later at night where no one is around) but I think it's completely unfair that we just can't go whenever we please. HAs anyone been in this situation that could offer any advice? Should I just let it go and go to the other beach that is 60 minutes away or try to reason with someone? I obviously don't think I've done anything wrong that got me and the kids \"banned.\" I just feel like  I pissed off the life guard and that he's just getting back at me. \n\n----------------------------------\n\n**Edit 1:** Kids are napping and I decided to contact the city's council since I really can't find the number of the park's direction. I'm on hold. \n\n**Edit 2:** Okay, I called! I got transferred to this sweet lady who took my call very seriously and who was super professional about it. \n\nShe was in total disbelieve and just couldn't believe that they would have asked a mom and her two kids to leave because of that. She asked me over and over if \"I had any alcohol with me, if my daughter was twenty, not two, and if I was topless myself.\" She also kept apologizing and said \"I'm so sorry, this is just crazy, I don't see why it wouldn't be allowed and I don't see why you'd lie.\" She put me on hold (for a good 10 minutes) and when she came back she apologized for what had happened, she says that if everything did indeed happen like I say it did (they obviously want to question the security guards about it) that there was absolutely no reason for me to leave. \n\nShe said that the \"security guards\" are actually volunteers who are required by school to volunteer and that they don't actually have any power of asking people to leave or to \"dress up.\" So that if I wanted to I could just go back and give them their number (the city's number) or to contact the local police and ask them to send an officer over non-urgently and not to be bothered by them. She gave me the case number too in case I need it and she promised that she'd call me back to update me after they get a hold of the life guards and tell me what was going to happen. She ended the conversation by saying that she was a grandmother of a 4 year old who goes to to beach topless and never thought of it as offensive. \n\n-------------------------\n\nYou guys are great by the way. However, I do wish to say that I don't plan on hurting, harming, fighting, yelling and doing any other type of damage to anyone, specially not teenagers. I also don't really plan on suing them, or harass them. So while your advice is really appreciate it, those are things I just will not do. ",

            "selftext": "A few weeks back my 7yo son, while being a goofball at school, touches a girl between the legs. The girl freaks out, and the school escalates everything to 11. The police are called as the incident is automatically flagged as a sexual assault since the genitals are involved. Children's Aid is called. My son is given a one day suspension.\n\nToday, my son gets in a little spat with a different girl. Crayons are thrown in class. In the hallway, she grabs him, chokes him, and knees him in the groin. It was enough to send my son to the ground in tears. My wife gets called to come take our son home for fighting in school. My wife asks if the police and CAS have been called because of the school's policy on sexual assault (any contact with the genitals - as told to us by the principal a few weeks ago).\n\nThe principal says NO, because the attack wasn't sexual in nature. NEITHER WAS WHAT OUR SON DID A FEW WEEKS AGO! My wife ripped into the principal in the office and forced his hand. The principal called the police. Then my wife asks about the automatic one-day suspension. The principal is all wishy-washy and says he has to talk to the other parents first. My wife communicates this to me.\n\nI call the school and rip into the principal for his double standard. He had no problem calling the police and suspending my son in a heartbeat, but a girl knees my son in the groin and he has to talk to the other parents first?\n\nThank god the school year is over this week!\n\n[/RANT]\n\nEDIT: In regards to when my son touched the other girl. There was absolutely nothing sexual or malicious about it. It was a \"goofball\" moment. Goofing around, getting too silly, not thinking. What he did was very inappropriate, but it was in absolutely no way malicious.  I took what he did very seriously. We have had multiple conversations before and after about appropriate and inappropriate touching. He understands what he did was wrong.",

Second, there is no mechanism by which an overpriced plastic jewelry is going to fix their mouth pain. It's pseudoscience, it's nonsense, it's the  placebo effect for tired parents. My child's life is not worth it, stop pushing it on me like you have a cure-all.   \n\nI wouldn't give her homeopathic medicine, I wouldn't take her to a chiropractor, why would I make her wear a magical necklace? Jesus fucking Christ. \n\nhttp://www.whattoexpect.com/first-year/ask-heidi/amber-teething-necklaces.aspx \n\nFor more info about the necklaces, visit https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/amber-waves-of-woo/ \n\nEdit: My comments on chiropractic and acupuncture have drawn some ire, but please understand how hypocritical you sound: \"Haha, yeah those amber necklaces are dumb, but acupuncture cured my back pain!\". That's some crazy cognitive dissonance. \n\nMany of you have little or no understating of what either acupuncture or chiropractic even is, but you'll defend it since it purports to do \"something\". Please browse over to https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/ to understand what they are and read the studies that have placed both firmly in the pseudoscience category. It is pre-scientific quackery that has been tamed by time and tacit mainstream acceptance to become  an \"alternative medicine\".\n\nEdit: Regarding chiropractic care : nobody has yet told me what exactly is being \"adjusted\" in their poor child. Whatever it is, there is no evidence to support it, and these \"adjustments\" can be incredibly dangerous. \n\nhttps://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/pediatric-chiropractic-care-scientifically-indefensible/\n\n\" Spinal manipulation has the potential to injure the spine of a child. A systematic review of 13 studies published up to June 2004 uncovered 14 significant manipulation-related injuries in children up to18 years of age, 9 of which were serious (e.g., subarachnoidal hemorrhage, paraplegia) and 2 of which were fatal (one child died from a brain hemorrhage and another from dislocation of the atlas following neck manipulation). Ten of the injuries were attributed to manipulation done by chiropractors, 1 to manipulation by a physiotherapist, and 1 to manipulation by a medical doctor; 2 injuries were caused by unspecified providers of manipulation. In 20 cases of harm caused by delayed diagnosis as a result of using manipulation, 7 involved a delayed diagnosis of cancer; 2 children died because of delayed treatment for meningitis.5\u00a0The incidence of spinal injuries in children is reported to be 2 to 5% of all spine injuries.21\"\n\nThere is no defensible or identifiable reason for a child to seek chiropractic care.

            "selftext": "I'm 34, my husband is 36, we've been married 6 years, together 11, and have 1 child - our 9 year old daughter.  I'm caucasian, my husband is Native American.\n\nAs our daughter matures, and believe me, I hate myself for saying this, please don't lambast me, it just is a logical fact, she's very physically unattractive.  She got the worst traits of both my husband and I.  His wide set eyes and strong nose, most of his facial bone structure, actually, my stocky build and curly hair, her skin tone is pretty much right between mine and his.  \n\nNeither my husband or I are models, but I think we're average looking to slightly above.  Like most people.  We have some favorable features and unfavorable features, also like anyone.  Some may find us unattractive, some may not, but it just is what it is.\n\nBut our daughter, though physically normal, honestly *looks* like she has some sort of disability.  So much so we had her tested.  She doesn't.  One doctor, who was filling in for our regular doctor when DD fell and her arm, when explaining to us how to help her wear a splint for what was, thankfully, just a moderate sprain, said \"When a child has Down's syndrome....\"\n\nShe doesn't *have* Down's syndrome.\n\nAnother tried to refer us to a craniofacial specialist because she thought our daughter had Apert Syndrome.  \n\nWe tell our daughter she's beautiful, because she IS beautiful.  She's funny, generous, compassionate - she's the kid that's always rescuing stray kittens and putting bugs back on leaves.  We were out for ice cream once and a boy she didn't even know dropped his cone and started crying.  His parents yelled at him and said that was it, they didn't have money for another one.  When my daughter got her cone, she walked over and handed it to this boy.  She has her moments, like any 9 year old, but she has a kind heart like nothing I've ever seen in a child so young, and phenomenal insight and empathy for others.  We love her dearly, and she IS a beautiful person.  I wouldn't want any other child, even if I could have the most physically beautiful child on earth.\n\nBut the facts are still what they are.  She's not attractive.  Of course we don't ever, EVER even allude to this.  We try to help her make the most of what she has, constructively.  We let her choose her own clothing for the most part, but it's \"Which shirt do you like better?  This one, or this one?\" and try to choose colors and cuts that flatter her body and complexion.  We aren't strict about it, she of course has a few things that I cringe when she puts them on, like any child, but we try to dress her well and right for her age and body.  \n\nI generally style her hair, because she has my hair exactly.  Over the years I've learned what works best.  But she's now to the age that she wants to wear the styles her friends wear, and do her hair herself, with very mixed results.  \n\nAnd, as she gets older, kids have begun to notice her looks.  Some have made rude comments.  A couple kids in the park have asked \"Why does that girl look that way?\" to their parents.  \n\nI feel beyond awful that I feel this way.  But, because she is such a wonderful person inside, it hurts me the more that her peers won't see past her physical appearance.  And, may god strike me dead for saying this, I'd almost rather she DID have a disability or chromosomal disorder.  Then there would be an explanation for the way she looks other than just \"bad genetic luck\".  \n\nI confided in a good friend and she told me that she might grow into her looks.  I guess that's possible.  I hope she will.  \n\nBut, I just don't know how first, handle my feelings about the fact that my child isn't physically attractive.  It's hard to reconcile with how much I love her, and what a wonderful person she is.  I wish I could look at her and see physical beauty too, but I just... can't.  I cry about it, a lot.  She just has such a wonderful heart and personality, it was like god (define that how you will) could only let her have one type of beauty.  And I'd rather have her be a good hearted person more than anything else.  But life will be hard for her and she doesn't deserve that.  I just don't know how to NOT feel guilty that I don't think my own child is adorable and gorgeous.\n\nAnd two, how can I help her look HER best?  How do I answer the \"am I pretty mommy?\" questions?  \n\nJust... please don't hate me.  I hate myself enough as it is.  I just want to help my daughter grow to be a healthy, happy young woman, and not let her appearance get in the way of letting the world know what a wonderful person she is.     ",

However, after much research, thought and deliberation, I have changed my mind. I think my baby will be perfect the way he is and we don't need to fold to some religious practice that we don't even believe in, or do it so that he can keep his foreskin clean (we can teach him basic hygiene skills!), or because that's the way other people do it, or a variety of other unnecessary reasons, in my opinion. It's not my right to make this decision about my son's body, but I would wholeheartedly support him if he chose to do it later in life, when he was capable of making such a choice. I shared this viewpoint with my husband a few months ago, and while he was reluctant at first, he agreed with me because he could see that I knew more about it than him, I felt strongly enough and what I said made sense. I thought the issue was resolved. Now, he's telling me, without doing any research of his own, that no matter what he learns about circumcision, he will advocate for it because it's \"normal to him.\" I am pretty upset about this because I feel that he is going into this with a closed mind - I asked him to please research what I had found out before making his choice, and he said it wouldn't matter what he read, he is not going to change his mind.

            "selftext": "I'm faced with this very problem and just don't have the answers. I refuse to let one of my in laws be around our 5 month old because of her morphine addiction. She was recently diagnosed with cancer that she won't likely survive and I'm getting the feeling everyone is expecting me to lift my ban against her. What are your experiences with these things?\n\nEdit: I'm so sorry, the aunt was diagnosed, my kids is very healthy. \nEdit 2: I am not the Mom. I'm Dad. \n\nEdit 3: to clarify some common response I see, I'm not an addict hating asshole. I don't want the relative loaded on anything around my kid. I've told her, and the rest of the in laws this. Not one person supports me. None. I moved on my stance a smidge to keep from ostracizing myself from family functions and asked her to please stay clean at our gatherings and I'd drop it. She agreed. She admits she has a problem. The very next gathering 2 weeks later, she was so fucked up she could barely talk. Not uncommon, seen it plenty before. She's overdosed about 6 times in the 4 years I've known her. She's in her 60s. I recently learned that she used to have a really violent temper, grabbing kitchen knives and diving after people over a counter. I'm a father to my first child in my 30s. I understand I'm being mother hen like. It's my first kid. I want the best everything for my kid. So that's sort of where I'm coming from. I'm glad some of you are calling me an asshole, i came here for honest opinion and I'm glad that's what I'm getting. Thank you. \n\nI also told this person if they simply don't abuse drugs only when they know we're going to be around, I'd never bring it up. This person was literally stoned the very next visit. I continue to offer help and visitation with the only stipulation being she stays sober. Historically she runs off to a bathroom and does whatever, comes back out wasted. I'm done with it.  \n\nHoly hell I'm trying to keep up with the replies but I'm on kid duty so I'm doing my best during naps. \n",

            "selftext": "I'll go ahead and preface this and say that I can 100% guarantee this is going to be a polarizing post at best, hence the throwaway account. I'm keeping the details as light as possible because of the nature of what happened. This is going to be a really long post, so I apologize.\n\nWe've struggled a lot with my teenage daughter. Yeah yeah, I know everyone does, but we've been having problems since she was 6 or 7. Her psychologist thinks she is ADHD w/ODD, but ADHD medicine had no affect on her or even created episodes worse than what I am about to describe. Her psychiatrist thinks because of the reaction to the medicine and episodes of depression and cutting she's bipolar. Who knows. Every time we give her a responsibility or a privilege, she takes it past the boundaries we set and yells when we explain to her it's the rules. For example: we let her walk home from school, she took it upon herself to make huge deviations on the way home and ended up picking up used cigarette butts off the ground to smoke. We gave her a phone, she would often do inappropriate things and lose her phone for a while, ultimately culminating in her sending nudes to an older guy which led to her losing her phone privileges.\n\nShe is a good kid most of the time, but she keeps herself isolated from the rest of the family and doesn't respond to affection and regularly tells us how much she hates being around us. We've tried everything in parenting books, advice from friends, advice from psychologists, and she responds to nothing, but we look like shitty parents because she fails in school (she literally has F's in everything right now) and is defiant to everything. We love her to death but we have no clue what to do with her.\n\nThat's enough background, on to the incident. I knew her grades were bad and I've been riding her ass since 2nd or 3rd grade about doing homework. I try to help her but she doesn't like that. She complains and gets upset if we try to make her do her homework downstairs. Knowing she was failing, I told her two or three times to do her homework. About an hour or two later, she decided to take a 30 minute shower instead. So when she got out, I came into her room and told her to do her homework. About 10 minutes later she decided it was time to blow dry her hair, so I came into her room again and told her to do her homework and began to lecture her about her grades because at this point I was losing patience and getting a tad irritated that she was ignoring me. During the lecture she turned the blow dryer on again so that the noise drowned me out. I got angry and took the blowdryer from her and told her I did not appreciate her trying to drown me out, and told her to go downstairs to do her homework so I could help her. She said \"I don't like you guys, I hate being around you guys, I don't want to do my homework with you\" More words were exchanged, and at some point she got upset and said \"This is bullshit, you're acting like a bitch.\" I told took her TV power cord for being disrespectful, and she started cursing more, so I told her she wasn't going to the upcoming school dance because of her grades and her constant disrespect for us, and I'm not wasting my money buying a dress for someone that says they hate me. She started yelling more, and I yelled back that we really did not appreciate the abuse she heaps on us (her parents) and her little sister (she treats her pretty bad too) and that she's too smart to have F's, then closed her door.\n\nHer mother came upstairs to see what the commotion was about as I was putting up the things I had taken from her. According to her mother, my daughter opened the door, looked at her for a few seconds, and tossed a fairly heavy box at her face. I was coming out of the room and all I heard is a thud of something hitting someone, then as I reached the door I saw my wife bent over crying with blood pouring from her face. Let me just say that my daughter is not a weak girl. She is a wrestler and is very lean and strong (last measurement was about 54% muscle), so when she throws something like that it has some serious force behind it.\n\nSo here is where you guys are about to take a sharp turn on your opinion of me in this story. I am not proud of it, and it's been quite a while and I'm still having problems dealing with this because this is just not me, hence why I'm posting here to try to find some way to reconcile. Something about seeing my wife bleeding and crying sent me into rage mode, and I guess the adrenaline dump caused things to get fuzzy because my memory of the event is a blur. Our doors are very close together (like on corner from each other at the end of the hallway), so I quickly rounded the corner and punched her in the face. I didn't have time to evaluate what was going on, but I was under the assumption that she may be attacking her mom so all I knew is that I needed to protect my wife. I didn't know what was coming next, but I have had to disarm her while she was holding an 8\" chef's knife before, not sure if she was going to attack me or herself, so I guess in my lizard brain I wasn't about to take the chance of someone bigger and stronger and trained to fight attacking my wife. Obviously this stopped whatever was going on, tears were shed everywhere, and I apologized in the morning (at which point my daughter told me she meant to attack me instead of her mom).\n\nI don't know, that's about it. What I did was horrible and I can't help but feel guilty (obviously). There's no excuse for it. I should not have responded to violence from my child with violence. She breaks my heart constantly and I have no clue how to deal with her anymore. Every time she cuts herself or talks about wanting to die I wonder where I failed as a parent. Every time I get a call from a teacher or principal because she acted out or because she's failing, I can feel them assuming I don\u2019t try my best to shape her into a good person, and that I don\u2019t care if she doesn\u2019t do her homework. I know that those parents exist but I\u2019m not a parent uninvolved in my children\u2019s lives and I\u2019m always pushing them to be their best. I\u2019m not sure what to do anymore because I\u2019ve been doing this for a long time now.\n\nHell, how am I even going to talk to her psychologist about this? \"Yeah my daughter threw a box at my wife and I punched her in the face. No clue why my daughter has so may problems.\" It sounds like it's the norm for me to hit her and I've not hit a person since I was a little kid and didn't know any better. I'm worried they will call CPS because of this. I'm not a bad or violent person, but I just went into instant \"protect my wife\" mode.\n\nI don't know exactly what advice I'm looking for from you guys. I expect to be admonished for my reaction, and that's warranted. I just want my daughter to be part of our family and to apply herself, but I don't know if that's ever going to happen.",

I have a 5yr old with such an awful disrespectful additude  that if she was an adult, I'd ask her to leave and never come back... and a checked-out, self-absorbed workaholic of a husband. I'm spent. \n\nI have spent every single day of my life since I was pregnant with my first, six years roughly, in service to my family. I try to discipline my eldest and my husband gives in when I'm not looking. I try to escape for some \"me\" time ( I'm  talking 10 minutes showering after a week of not having a chance ooooh-ahhh!) and my husband becomes passive aggressive about having to watch the kids. Then the baby screams and everyone gives up and it's on me to make everyone satiated. Constantly.\n\nMy husband isn't helping. He genuinely thinks about work 24/7. \n\nI am slipping away emotionally. Yes we've tried counseling and sure it works and then the stasis returns.\n\nMy five year old drifts day in and out in her hovel of snot-nosed dissention, my husband goes away on business, comes home and his eyes glaze over, the baby refuses to rest and is up four times every-single-effing-night. Everyone is driving me to maddness. I have zero opportunity to even read a page in a book or get a drink with out \"Mommy can I have some? \" or \"Hey, Honey can you (insert request)\".\n\nI snapped today and yelled at the baby. My sweet baby girl looked horrified. It confirmed what I've been suspicious of for a long time:I'm a piece of shit. That's why if been invisible for so long. That's why I have no friends, no education, no hope for anything besides endless, thankless unyielding servitude.\n\nI'm beginning to wonder what this is all for. I don't what to be in a role of unrecognised self-sacrifice any longer. We have money, I could just leave and force them all to finally see the role I played in their life. Hell, they'd all have to suddenly feed themselves and venture down the stairs to the mysterious land where their clothes become clean.\n\nI can't be this person anymore. I never used to be this pathetic, angry and lonely. I'm reduced to begging a baby to nap so that I can sweep the cheerios up and sneak a few minutes to myself.\n\nI want to abandon my family and start over.\n\nEdit : Thank you all for your meaningful input. I'm at my rock-bottom as I'm sure many of you have observed. Having some normal, sane people say \"I felt/feel like that too\" is amazingly cathartic. There's so many encouraging comments. I'm going to work though this somehow. I will update how our conversation goes this evening.\n\nUpdate: The support I've gotten here today is amazing. All your kindness and advice  has been devoured and taken in. The conversation with my husband went off like a bomb. I cried a lot. He looked  scared. We fought a bit and I laid it out. We're getting some child care. He needs to be involved or I'm dragging both of us back to therapy. Also, I'm going to start throwing shit away. The less crap that I have to pick up, clean and keep  tidy, the better. Lastly, I'm going back to school. Period. He's going to have to bend and help me make that work. I'm  seriously considering some solo therapy, too.",

            "selftext": "With the recent outbreak of measles in CA, I did a little investigating and found that 35% of my daughter's kindergarten classmates are not vaccinated for MMR.  We go to a public Los Angeles Unified School and there are state laws that allow parents to submit a \"Personal Exemption\" to avoid vaccinating their kids.  The school is required to admit them if they have an Exemption.\n\nMy question for the reddit community:  What can I do?  I can't move my kid to a different school.  I can't afford private school (although many of those have even worse vaccination rates).  But I am concerned about my kids (and others) health safety.\n\nAre there any suggestions that I, as an individual parent, could offer to the teachers/principal to encourage parents to vaccinate?  I know the chances of my child contracting measles is small but its now much greater since misinformed parents have stopped vaccinating.\n\nThanks Reddit!\n\nEDIT: FIXED PUNCTUATION!",

            "selftext": "I feel stunned just writing this. I can't even begin to think how differently my day could be going if it wasn't for a half-second glance by my wife, followed by a desperate lunge.\n\nWe have a 15 month old daughter. About six months ago we bought a bookshelf designed to hold children's books with the covers facing out. So it's very flat and has a narrow footprint. Of course we were worried about it falling over but when we first tried to drill holes in the wall to secure it we realised there was stone or metal under the drywall and our flimsy drill couldn't penetrate. We meant to get a hammer drill, but didn't. Our daughter at the time was so little that she wasn't going anywhere on her own.\n\nBut time passed, the shelf filled up with books, and she got bigger and stronger and more curious.\nIt got to a point where we were like 'OK we really need to secure that' but never seemed to get around to it. Of course we would watch her and try to be in the room with her, but she didn't really seem interested in pulling/climbing the shelf so we kind of started to feel at ease about it. Big mistake obviously.\n\nThis morning we were both scrambling trying to groggily get ready for work, and our daughter was kind of toddling from room to room, following us or whatever. We had a moment's peace because she went into her room (she sometimes likes to sit on the floor and read her books quietly). I was in the bathroom brushing my teeth when I heard my wife literally yell 'OH MY GOD NO'.\n\nI figured our daughter had got into her mom's makeup or something, so sauntered out of the bathroom to look.\nShe'd tried to climb the bookshelf and pulled it away from the wall far enough that it began falling.\n\nMy wife had just happened to be walking past and glanced in just in the split-second between when it started to fall and, well...\n\nShe had lunged out and stopped it falling, but if she hadn't... we hefted it afterwards to feel the weight of it full of books.\n\nIt could have cracked our daughter's skull. It could have killed her. \n\nThe only thing that saved her was sheer luck, and if something had happened we would literally only have ourselves to blame.\n\nIf I had read about this in the newspaper, I would have thought those parents were negligent and stupid, but now I know that in the constant chaos that is parenting (with two working parents), things can sometimes fall through the cracks. Especially when you're all a bit sleep deprived and frazzled.\n\nSo that's my story. I feel terrible about it and I can't even comprehend how close we came to disaster. I can't even begin to imagine how we would live with ourselves if we'd let something happen like that.\n\nSo please. Help me get through the day here. Have any of you had any close calls/moments of negligence?",

My wife on the other hand tends to wear me out 2x as much as the kids do. Me and her have really different outlooks on life. Me being very laid-back and never one to hurry or invent work, and her being very much a busybody, always looking for some task to be occupied with. \n\nIn the past this was never really an issue, but now with the boys it's become a source of friction. She rarely ever lets me complete some task without giving me some sort of \"help\". She complains she has to do everything herself, which really just means that she's pissed off that I don't do everything in the way and at the moment she wants it done.\n\nI feel many days like I live with my parents again with someone breathing down my neck all the time. It's really getting on my nerves. Even sometimes to the point where we hardly talk during the day. I know that having small kids puts a lot of demand on a relationship, but also know that some level of mutual respect and space is pretty crucial in dealing with that stress.\n\nI guess my question is, do women (sorry for the generalization) tend to chill the fuck out a bit once kids are older? Can I expect to have to deal with this shit for the rest of my life? The thought of being one of these beaten-down men with a nagging wife of 40 years makes me want to gouge out my fucking eyes, and I'd rather be single than that.\n\nThanks Redditors.",

            "selftext": "So, my daughter is a special case and my wife and I are at our wits end trying to figure out what is different about our daughter and how to get her the help she needs. Our daughter is 9 years old, we have a 2 year old son, and are currently trying for another one. My wife and I have a healthy relationship, have a loving household, eat well and exercise, and are all around healthy in just about every way. When it comes to our daughter, something is just...off about her and other people readily notice this. People that first meet her are drawn in to her personality but after getting to know her, they realize she\u2019s a broken human being inside.\n\nAt around 4 years old, our daughter, would suddenly go into these trance-like tantrums that would last hours. For example, say she was playing with a ball and was asked to put the ball away to come eat dinner. If she didn\u2019t want to, she would get angry and refuse. You could be nice, try to persuade her, bribe her, or do any other trick to get her to change her mind but she would become fixated on fighting with the cover of playing with the ball. If we were to take the ball from her, she would immediately become fixated on hurting anyone near her (scratching, throwing things, biting, etc) and would repeat the phrase \u201cGive me my ball!\u201d for hours until her episode ended and never say anything else other than that phrase (or \u201cGive me [insert item]\u201d or \u201cLet me do [insert activity]\u201d). You could try and talk with her, but all she would do is repeat the phrase while screaming and crying while also trying to seriously hurt you. It was seriously like she was in a trance because you couldn\u2019t communicate with her while she was having an episode. They were unlike any tantrums we\u2019ve ever experienced and the staff at her daycare, then school, had ever witnessed.\n\nOur daughter is a compulsive liar. If you ask her if she did something like brush her teeth, without hesitating she will give you the answer you want instead of the truth (always no since she has very poor hygiene and my wife and I have to monitor her to ensure she bathes properly and brushes her teeth, even at 9 years old). One of her chores was to walk the dog when she got home from school in order to establish a routine for her, but she would take the dog out into the hallway and wait for 10-15 minutes, then come back in as if she actually walked him. She quickly lost that chore when I caught her abusing the dog by repeatedly yanking the leash so hard it knocked him off his feet after we once again caught her in the lie and she was mad at the dog for whining about having to go pee.\n\nShe constantly breaks things for no real reason other than she wanted to break them. I will randomly find things broken around the house and know how it happened. The other day, the vinyl lining on the new cabinets were peeling and I knew she did it (she lied at first, then copped to it). She breaks her brother\u2019s toys, her mother\u2019s jewelry, just about anything lying around. She does not care about anyone else\u2019s things other than her own. If you break one of her toys, though, she blows up. She also does weird things to our 2 year old\u2019s toys. We recently found out she was peeing in a bucket and soaking up the urine in her brother\u2019s water-squirting bath toys \u201cjust because.\u201d He enjoyed those toys and she didn\u2019t like that, so she ruined it.\n\nShe is extremely manipulative. She had the school counselor wrapped around her finger from K-3rd grade, but this year the counselor finally admitted to herself that she was being played and put her foot down. This girl even manipulated her previous therapist into believing I was emotionally abusing her and had CPS investigate us for child abuse. The CPS agent did the investigation and concluded that our daughter was lying and that our household is not abusive at all. We don\u2019t spank our kids, nor do we mistreat them (even after all she\u2019s put us through). After realizing that she could inflict real stress and damage to our family by using CPS, our daughter began repeatedly threatening to call CPS on us to say we were abusing her. She had some bruises on her arms from a side effect from her Prozac and she lied and told the school that I caused the bruises. Well, another CPS investigation was conducted and the same agent soon realized my daughter was once again lying to everyone.\n\nHer grandfather, who she was close with, recently passed away and the first thing out of our daughter\u2019s mouth was, \u201cWho gets his iPad?\u201d She has no empathy for anyone and can not connect with anyone. She has no friends at school, is never invited to any parties or activities, and has been ostracized by her peers for her behavior. She constantly acts out in school and is a bully. When she was in 1st grade, she forced another little girl to squat over the bathroom floor drain and urinate in front of her just because she if she could make another kid do it. The little girl was traumatized but the school hid this incident from us for months for reasons we are unsure of.\n\nWe started taking our daughter to therapy when she was 5. However, after spending months with a therapist and getting nowhere and the therapists not providing any insight into what was wrong with her, we would try a new therapist and hope that maybe the next one will be the one to break through to her. Nope, they all kept telling us different things: that she has ADHD, that she is just depressed, that she has a generic mood disorder, etc. We took her to a neurologist who did blood work and an EEG at a therapist\u2019s recommendation and got nowhere. She\u2019s been on Prozac, Adderall, Intuniv, Lexapro, and vitamins and nothing has changed. She\u2019s had five different therapists and each one has diagnosed her with different things. They all love taking our money but none of them have shown any interest in really helping her.\n\nWhere the heck do we go for help? What do we do? Therapy isn\u2019t helping, medication isn\u2019t helping, nothing we do at home helps. My wife and I are both afraid this little girl will grow up to be a serial killer if she keeps this up. We can\u2019t connect with her, she doesn\u2019t have any attachment to any other people, she mistreat animals, she destroys property for the fun of it, and we have to keep her away from her little brother because she will hit him just to see him cry. This girl has become so bad that we dread having her in the house with us because she\u2019s either going to break something, hurt someone, or cause problems. We\u2019ve resorted to video recording all of her episodes to protect us in case she reports us to CPS again. Where do we go from here? Please help us.\n\nTL;DR: Our daughter lacks empathy, loves destroying things, mistreats animals and other kids, and has violent episodes. Years of therapy and medication haven\u2019t made any progress and she is getting worse as she gets older. Where do we go for help?\n",

            "selftext": "Last night I was getting ready to take the son out for a walk. I put him in the stroller on the front porch like I always do, and held the stroller with one hand while I turned to close the door with the other. Never had any issues with this before. \n\nHe leaned forward, which made the stroller pivot on the back wheel and the front wheel went forward, going of the one step on the porch, which twisted the handle in my hand and went out of my grip. I tried to sort of lunge for it, but didn't get it. The whole stroller tipped forward and he basically went face first into the concrete walkway. \n\nI immediately dropped the keys and got him out and picked him up. He had a scrape on his forehead and cheek and his lips were already starting to swell and his gums were bloddy, but all his teeth were still there and not loose. Looks like the stroller took most of the blow but he still definitely hit the side of his face on the ground. I was crying myself and held him and rocked him and was trying to sing to him and calm him down, which he eventually did.\n\nWife had been out and so I called her and she rushed home. Now, if he had been 5 years old or something and he'd fallen into the pavement playing, I'd have washed him off, put some ice on it, and told him to be more careful. But my son is still under a year old and I didn't know exactly how hard he hit or how to check for a concussion in babies. \n\nWe brought him to the ER and waited a really long time, and when the NP came back, she was basically like \"...he's fine. As long as he's acting normal (beyond being upset that he's in pain) and not vomiting and focusing on things and so forth, just keep the abrasions clean and put some neosporin on them if you want and he'll be fine\". \n\nI'm really really angry at myself. I know I should have put the stroller down on the grass or something and then put him in it, but I'd never had an issue before. I can just see the thing tipping over in my mind every time I close my eyes.\n\nAnd honestly, beyond my own guilt and being upset he's hurt, possibly the worst thing is that I have no idea when my wife is going to forgive me. I can tell she blames me (rightfully so), but it's giving me some building anxiety knowing that she won't trust me for whoe knows how long.\n\nI guess I'm posting this because I feel so guilty and I just had to write about it, and I was hoping maybe someone would have some similar story about how their kid got hurt and it was their fault and everything turned out okay and your spouse didn't hate you forever.\n\nIf you want to tell me I am, in fact, a piece of shit bad parent then I guess that's okay too. This is reddit so I fully expect at least a few of those. \n\nJust kind of needed to get it all off my chest and /r/offmychest is probably not filled with parents who would have any sort of understanding.  \n\nedit: thank you everyone for your kind words. It's immensely helpful to know I'm not the only one (I mean, I guess I kind of knew I wasn't, but it felt like it) and to know your kids all seemed to come out fine from similar or even worse-seeming injuries.

At a PTA meeting they decided to illustrate this point by asking every parent of a child with food allergies to raise their hand; nobody raised their hand. They banned a lunch staple from school grounds because somebody MIGHT be allergic to it, though none are.  \n\nNow, there are teal pumpkins for people that are handing out things other than candy on *Halloween* for goodness' sake. If your kids have food allergies, I feel for you, but I feel it is your responsibility to ensure they don't consume the foods they are allergic to, not the entire world's. If my daughter has a friend who has an allergy, my wife and I will be sure to put away all items containing the offending element. But to require that kind of behavior from the whole world is just silly.  \n\nI had a friend that had a peanut allergy growing up, and on Halloween she just knew not to pick the candy that had peanuts in them. At lunch, she knew not to eat my PB&amp;J. Why are kids today any different?\n\nEdit: to clarify, it's not really the fact that nuts aren't allowed, or the fact that there are teal pumpkins, or the fact that my kid isn't allowed to bring anything sugary to school.

She's not as close as she used to be (I am not either, admittedly), our sex life is buried below the shitter BC we both stay so dam tired (or busy with work in my case), and I fucking hate all of this. \n\nParents of reddit: have you ever made a serious career move, taken a large (20%ish?) pay cut, or any other major lifestyle change in hopes to see your kid more?\n\nI can't decide if this is merely impatience with my job, or a true belief that I'm going to be married to my company for the next 20 years. Whatever it is, I want to see my kid and my wife more and am seriously considering making a change from my current job/industry to something completely different in hopes that I can make that happen.\n\nThanks for letting me vent.",
