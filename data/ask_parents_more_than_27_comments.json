I brought it up to my mom asking what she uses it for, since we are saving for a car, and I wanted these lessons. \n\nShe revealed that she's been giving it to my older brother (late 20s, broke at the moment) to help his situation (who i believe is in debt to my dad) and she also said target :/ \n\nBut my main question is should I be rightfully a little upset about this? Isn't that what child support is for? or is it just extra money to help pay the bills and other things?",

How do you chose a diaper brand? Are you brand loyal, would you go to a different store for a specific brand? Have you ever tried cloth diapers? Do you have any complaints about diapers in general?\n\nOne non-diaper related question: Do you use other compostable or eco-friendly single-use products?\n\nThanks in advance!",

So it's hard for me to understand this phenomenon.\n\nWhen I've googled for articles about this, it's almost entirely about strategies for getting the kid to eat, or to eat healthier, or to eat more. It's VERY rare for someone to say they just let the kid be hungry, and stick to that; and if someone suggests it, they say it very meekly, as if afraid they will be attacked for it.\n\nHas anyone here, or anyone you know, actually done that? What happens if that is a parent's strategy for getting a kid to eat? It's hard for me to believe that a kid would waste away to nothing rather than eat what was available. Kids in poor countries eat if there's food available for them, so there ARE places where if you don't eat what's available, you just don't eat.\n\nWhat's the story about what happens if a parent is strict about this?",

I was so worried for her, and seemed to be more worried than her own mother. \n\nIf you were the mom in this situation what would you have done?",

This makes no sense to me. They go on holidays for 20 days and leave me home alone, my boyfriend is the only one by my side when I'm alone and they decide to go explore the world without their kids for almost a month. And I can't even be trusted to have sex in their house because it's disrespectful? I feel like I don't deserve it. I feel like it's not my home. If we're not supposed to have sex in the house, we have to find somewhere else to do it. I just feel like parents are really selfish and only think of themselves. If you know your daughter and her boyfriend are in a long lasting relationship, love each other, support each other and are there for each other all the time, and you also know your daughter is highly responsible, why not let them have sex in your house? But yet they have loud sex with me in the house. It just makes no sense to me, parents please give me your respectful opinions",

            "selftext": "My parents, especially my dad, are extremely conservative. I\u2019m planning on have children within the next couple years, and one of my main concerns is how my parenting beliefs are going to clash with theirs right from the get go. For example, I don\u2019t believe in enforcing strict gender roles on my kids (basically I would just let them decide for themselves what toys/clothes they like, so a boy who wants a doll will not be prohibited from that). I have a 2 year old niece and everytime she is around my father he tries to brainwash her. Last week she tried to apply toy-makeup to him (not even real, just pieces of plastic) and he refused and told her that \u201cboys don\u2019t wear that, that\u2019s for \u201cfa*****\u201d. I was once coloring with her and one of the cartoon characters I made was black, and he looked at the drawing and said, \u201chuh, what criminal are you drawing in front of her?\u201d He makes extremely concerning sexist comments, including maintaining virginity that traumatized me and my idea of self worth as a kid. I kindly ask him to not instill hatred for others in my niece, but unfortunately her mother holds similar beliefs so I can only do so much. He laughs when I say that and says I\u2019m the one being hateful by criticizing him for enforcing \u201cthe Christian way and what\u2019s right.\u201d I deeply fear for how things are going to go when I have my own children. I am the only progressive in my family so I always end up looking like the insane one, since they all share similar beliefs. I can\u2019t even begin to imagine what would be said around them if I let them babysit. He would lose his mind if he sees my son with a doll. And who knows, maybe my son won\u2019t be interested in stereotypically \u201cgirl\u201d things, but having had experience in working with children I find that they are interested in all toys regardless of gender when they\u2019re not shamed for doing so. \n\nAnyone else going through this? How have you handled it? Or, if not yet, how would you handle it?",

He stated that he may be wasting his time with me because \u201cyou will never want kids\u201d to which I told him I can\u2019t say that I won\u2019t ever want kids, after all, everyone my entire life has always told me \u201cyou\u2019ll want them someday.\u201d But really, I don\u2019t want kids anymore than I did when I was twelve years old, the thought and feelings associated with motherhood still gives me a kind of uneasy feeling in my stomach and I am worried that my feelings won\u2019t change. So, although I am open to the idea, I\u2019m skeptical my feelings will change. Although my boyfriend has told me that he\u2019s not dead set on kids either I do feel he\u2019s leaning more to the side of wanting to have them given his alarming amount of concern that I currently don\u2019t want any. I\u2019m worried I\u2019m destined to break the heart of my current boyfriend and travel the less beaten path of never having kids.\n\nI don\u2019t really understand why I don\u2019t, and never have, had any warm fuzzy feelings surrounding the idea of being a mother. I\u2019m certain though, that it didn\u2019t help that my own mother seemed absolutely miserable raising me and my siblings (particularly me because I was \u201cborn difficult.\u201d) she cried and/or got angry and frustrated almost daily my entire childhood. She often screamed at me or grabbed me by my neck or hair when I was a kid and escalated to hitting and slapping while sitting on top of my body when I turned into a teenager. She tried really hard to be a good mom but she always got frustrated and failed and went into spiraling guilt and shame. I often felt like it was my fault she was so miserable. I feel she really did try but sometimes I wondered if it was slightly more important to her that she at least simply appear to be a good mom to the outside world because she could always keep it together in public but never behind closed doors. I feel like parenthood smothered her.\n\nRegardless, even for example a mentally stable mother, the day to day activities of a dedicated mother seem miserable and life sucking: cleaning feces, making a tiny and rather ungrateful human clean up after themselves, parent teacher meetings, SNOT so much SNOT. Screaming, crying, breaking my nice sh^t. Dealing with guilt from judge mental parents. I mean, I guess having a kid might be bearable if they were at least well behaved or grateful but most kids don\u2019t seem to be.\n\nAnyway, change my mind, or reaffirm my beliefs, I\u2019d really like to hear uncensored perspectives from you friendly strangers with or without kids of your own. And trust me I really do want to WANT to have kids because that\u2019s the more socially acceptable path to travel but I just can\u2019t see a whole lot of great things about being a parent other than the occasional feel good moments of making my kid happy.",

            "selftext": "Okay, so we adopted our daughter as a baby through foster care. My husband and I are below average in the looks department. We love each other and we're really happy together, best friends and all that, but we know neither of us is going to be strutting down the runway anytime soon. We have a biological son who looks like us. We think he's adorable, but objectively, he's an average looking kid. He doesn't get much attention in public, and we thought that was normal. \n\nBut our daughter. She's legit a gorgeous child. Having her as a baby was completely different from my son. I got stopped on every aisle of the grocery store. Every outing, multiple people would stop and fawn over her. As a baby, it was fine. She didn't know, enjoyed the attention, etc. Big brother was a toddler and didn't care either. I took her to a popular photography studio to have six month photos taken and the asked to use her photos for promotional purposes. I thought, okay, cute baby but she'll hit that awkward toddler phase and some of this hubub will die down. \n\nNope. It got a billion times worse because we moved out of the US to a foreign country. Now she's like a little celebrity. We have attracted a small mob before. Every outing, complete strangers start recording her and taking her picture. Sometimes they ask, but usually they don't. I'm protective of my children, but I don't hold their hand constantly. I usually give my kids space to walk for themselves on escalators and such, because, well, they're 3 and 4 now and they can walk by themselves. But people freak out if I let her do anything. God forbid she falls. People come running. I get scolded for letting her do things on her own by older women. We had a stranger - a mother - take her away from us on the beach to go take pictures of her. I was in the surf with my son, maybe 8 feet away? She was playing in the sand with shells and her little bucket. This lady just came and picked her up off our beach blanket. My daughter started crying for me, and I came running, but the lady just took pictures with my kid screaming her head off until I literally grabbed her out of the lady's arms. It's happened other times, too. I've been told it's a common thing in this particular culture. She's been grabbed like 3 times now? Obviously we're quick to grab her back, and it's always mothers with their own children in tow, but it's upsetting. \n\nNow my once outgoing kid is understandably terrified of strangers. She has developed a sixth sense for someone trying to snap her picture and goes running to the stroller, or buries her face in a stuffed animal. Other mothers will come up and say (IN FRONT OF THEIR OWN DAUGHTERS) that she is the sort of child they wished they had. Wherever we go, she is called \"little doll,\" \"beauty,\" \"Barbie baby.\" She gets angry and tells me that's not her name. \n\nI am, of course, being more protective. I stay within arm's reach now. At first I was very polite to people asking for her picture, but now I'm curt and say, \"No, she doesn't like it.\" But I don't know how to handle this. Is there anything different I can be doing? I keep both my kids in pretty cute clothes, but I've contemplated dressing her more plainly or pulling her hair back. My son has started to notice all the attention she gets, and has even started telling people \"That's my sister, she's shy. I'll talk to you.\" But they just ignore him. \n\nSo super hot moms who have gorgeous children, or grew up being treated the way my daughter is being treated, or siblings who looked very different from each other...what should I do? What can I do? I'm trying to praise her for being kind/smart/funny, and not emphasizing the looks. I'm doing my best to protect her in public and tell people to give her space, but I'm worried all the picture taking and recording and, for lack of a better description, kid cat-calling, is harming her and starting to change her personality. I feel bad for my son, who doesn't understand why everyone wants to talk to his sister but never to him. Any advice would be appreciated.",

Our sex life is awesome and I was just wondering if you feel like since it's changed because of having kids in the house?

We feel he struggles the most with the names itself. It seems like he just can't remember the names. He doesn't have problems when we ask to show the firemen color, grass color...  But from the moment we ask, show the pen that is blue... the guessing game starts. We now just use three colors to 'exercise' RGB. I ask red, he takes blue. We correct. I ask then blue, he takes green. We correct. I ask again red, he takes blue etc... After a while he starts getting it right but still with alot of errors. The next day I start with showing him the three colors and ask if he remembers a name of one of these colors. White? Sometimes he can't even go further if we give him the first letter. For clarification, we try to make it as fun as possible, no drilling every day because we feel he tries to 'escape' those moments. He 'knows' he isn't good at it and tries to escape 'the failure'. Needless to say he can name any construction vehicle :) Is this just not being ready or could there be more? At preschool they signaled this already last year around May.",

            "selftext": "Hello Redditors! \n\nI am in a long term relationship with my boyfriend and he has always insisted on having kids. However, I am truly on the fence about whether or not I want to be a mother. Kids in public have always gotten on my nerves, and I often resent how needy and spoiled that they appear to be. \n\nI also spend several hours per day folding ultra complex origami and studying mathematical textbooks on origami design. Not being able to spend ANY time doing that, a hobby that I love most, would be devastating for me. \n\nI do, however, love my boyfriend deeply and am mildly curious about what our kids would look like (we are an interracial couple). I can also see how having kids can be incredibly rewarding and fulfilling, watching them grow up and discover new things. \n\nBut then I read all of these posts on r/childfree about how awful parenting is, and how people don't have time for themselves anymore. I'm not sure how enjoyable it would be to go to the park with your kids only to watch them like a hawk and be concerned about their wellbeing. I also have some very severe food allergies that my children would likely inherit. Going to a restaurant is stressful enough on my own (worrying about peanut contamination), I can't imagine how scary/frustrating it would be to have an impulsive child with that same medical condition. \n\nAnyway, parents of reddit, is it worth it? Do you have any free time for hobbies/fun things??",

            "selftext": "Hi all.. new here, so bear with me if I\u2019m not doing something correctly. My husband and I (both 31) are expecting our first child in 10 short weeks. I took a week off work recently so we could have a \u201cbaby moon\u201d which turned into a long weekend visiting my family in NJ for our baby shower there (we live 6 hours away) and going down the shore for 3 days, as I could not get my husband to give me any input on anywhere he would like to go for our last vacation together. We have spent the last couple days of my last vacation without a baby trying to get the nursery started/finished. Last night we had friends over for dinner and my husband planned a short getaway to our favorite vacation spot (St. John, USVI) with the male friend. I questioned him doing this and he said \u201cdon\u2019t you think I deserve a vacation before I become a dad for the first time?\u201d Uhhhhh... that\u2019s what this past week was supposed to be. And you had no interest in helping me plan it.  But ok, fine, it\u2019s 3 days. We go every year and couldn\u2019t this year because of the risk of Zika, so I get his withdrawal. So I\u2019m just getting over that when he comes to bed and I see he\u2019s texting another friend about his bachelor party IN ARUBA. IN JANUARY. Our baby will be maybe 2 months old at this point, depending on when in January this trip is taking place. I expressed my dissatisfaction immediately and the response was a petty, childish \u201cfine, I\u2019ll just tell (friend) I can\u2019t go on his bachelor trip\u201d. I wanted to say Good! You shouldn\u2019t be leaving your wife and new born so soon anyway to go party it up with your bros in another f-ing country anyway! And the friend isn\u2019t getting married until JUNE. I\u2019m so frustrated. It\u2019s my first time being a mom, too, and you think it\u2019s ok to leave me when the baby is still so new to both of us? I can get over the short trip to StJ while I\u2019m still pregnant and I don\u2019t really *need* him, but I\u2019m going to NEED him in January. Am I wrong to tell him I don\u2019t want him to go? That his wife and new child should be his priority? Thanks in advance.",

            "selftext": "No matter where I live, it always seems like a stale, acrid odor develops over a short period of time. I don't know what it is that's causing it. I used to be much more of a slob, going without bathing for weeks at a time and making absolutely no effort to clean up after myself. I've since made bathing regularly habitual, and I make an effort to keep a clean living space. My apartment honestly looks no worse than the average person's living space. Yet, it still smells gross.\n\nI noticed today, as I was coming back into my apartment, that it smells even worse than usual. This would be bad enough by itself, except that my mother also came over not long after. She also noticed that it smelled horrid. She couldn't even stay in the building for very long. I've since opened the windows to let some fresh air in, but even by the standards of a stuffy living space, it has a remarkably rank smell.\n\nI've considered a number of solutions: a de-humidifier, an air purifier, maybe an air freshener, etc. When I suggested these things to my mother, she shot all of my ideas down and told me that it's because I'm lazy and irresponsible \u2013 I don't keep my apartment clean, my dishes are all dirty, I don't do laundry, I don't bathe often enough, I don't get out of the house regularly, and I never open the windows. She literally called me a slob, and told me that I need to grow up, to stop making excuses for myself, and to start acting my age (I'm 26).\n\nHere's the thing: with only one exception, none of what she said is true. I *do* open the windows every single day, usually all night long, for fresh air. I bathe *at least* once every second day, and preferably daily if I can. I don't have any garbage lying around that would cause anyone's living space to smell bad; if it's something that can rot, it goes out ASAP. My laundry was literally done yesterday evening, and nothing has gone for over a month without getting washed. Even the dishes in my sink (which don't number all that many, honestly) have at least been rinsed off with soap, so that no residue could form. Yet, it still smells awful. The only thing she accused me of that holds true is the fact that I lead a very sedentary lifestyle, and don't get outside often enough. This is 100% accurate. I have struggled with severe depression and anxiety for a very long time \u2013 before it was \"cool\" to have those things \u2013 and I haven't been able to work or attend school on years. It's hard for me to even muster the will to go anywhere for very long, and usually I'm desperate to get home as soon as possible.\n\nWhat could I be doing wrong? What are some solutions that I could consider for this problem?",

But I'm always paranoid that someone will see a snippet of this interesting and think I'm up to no good.\n\nShould I just ask the kids to give us space (seems rude to both then and my dog who loves the attention) or just soldier on with interacting with the kids and let three chips fall where they may.\n\nI'm a single guy in my 30s (no kids, yet) fwiw\n\n\nTl;Dr\n\nI'm afraid people will think I'm a pedophile for taking to kids in the park while walking my dog - am I too paranoid?

            "selftext": "Hi. My friend (21f) and her children (3yrs &amp; 7 months) live with myself and my girlfriend. (Both 23f).\nThey moved in with us to escape a pretty toxic situation. And 6 weeks ago, when they moved in, her fianc\u00e9 (&amp; children\u2019s father) came with them. About week 3 he decided it was all too much for him and he left for the opposite side of the country. So now, 3 weeks later here we are:\nShe is unemployed. \nShe has no money to her name.\nAnd hasn\u2019t been able to support her children the whole time she\u2019s been here. \nI could give her some slack and grace if she was trying or capable but...\n\nShe is a terrible parent. \nShe neglects the three year old to be with the baby. Who she doesn\u2019t play with but just constantly breastfeeds EVEN WHEN HE CLEARLY ISNT HUNGRY. He\u2019ll feed for like 3 mins and then go back to screaming and she just acts like he needs to eat? He\u2019s perfectly well fed. He\u2019s 7 months old. He wants to be stimulated! \nThe three year old was sick this weekend. This jobless woman didn\u2019t have so much as a thermometer to check the kids temp. AND THEN she told me she had children\u2019s Tylenol she had left in the car for a MONTH in AUGUST in TEXAS. And I\u2019m no doctor or rocket scientist but the bottle says to not leave in excessive heat for extended periods of time. So why would I give it to your kid??? I nurse this poor baby to a very low grade fever and put her to bed. I look at my friend and say \u201cI\u2019ve been rotating the Tylenol and ibuprofen she can have one at this tone and the other at this time if she wakes up in the night.\u201d This child woke up screaming at 2am and her mom didn\u2019t give her medicine because \u201cShe didn\u2019t want medicine\u201d \nOf course she doesn\u2019t want medicine!!!! It tastes gross and she\u2019s three!!! She is not old enough to make these kind of decisions for herself. So at 7am this sleepless child came into my room crying for me to take care of her.  Lo and behold she\u2019s fever free after two doses of medicine. \n\nThis woman is so careless and reckless and if someone else wasn\u2019t supervising, her kids would\u2019ve died. \nShe spent the whole night her kid was crying with a fever scrolling through tinder and laughing at people. And then posting all over Facebook about how hard it is to be a single mom when the only thing single about her is her relationship status! She hasn\u2019t had to do anything alone during her entire time as a mother. And currently? If she were alone she\u2019d be on the fucking streets because she\u2019s taken advantage of everyone that\u2019s ever cared for her and they no longer want anything to do with her. \nI\u2019ve talked to her about getting a job, about being more responsible, about taking the kids to the doctor, I\u2019ve given her all of the resources I have and know. I\u2019m seriously worried for the development of these children and what their lives will look like if I wasn\u2019t supporting them. But I\u2019m about to fucking snap and I don\u2019t know what to do any more. \nThis is mostly just a rant but if anyone has any ideas on how to get through to her I\u2019d really appreciate it.",

I\u2019m in constant pain and I have absolutely no joy left in life. \n\nI\u2019ve attempted suicide a few times, including early today, but I\u2019m always too scared to go through with it. However if I went to a clinic and was euthanised I\u2019d be fine.\n\nI know no parent probably wants their child to tell them they want to die, but I really have lost all hope and this is what want. \n\nWhat I\u2019m wondering is how I bring this up to them.

She has been in and out of the hospital for it. \nAll the white hair products don't work for my child's hair. It is too dry and tangles. We found Cantu and it was a miracle. I loved it and he was excited to get his hair done. \n\nUnfortunately, grandma can't be around my son because the scent in the hair products make her wheeze and she has to go for a breathing treatment. I am having trouble finding a product that both works well for his hair and has a mild scent. Does anyone know of any that I can try that  don't smell strong?",

All of the parents were falling over themselves excited to volunteer in the classroom \"to get to know each of the children in the classroom very well\".  The teacher and the aid were grinning ear to ear while gushing about how the hyper-involved parent community drives the early elementary learning at our public school. I'm so glad to be able to live in this affluent community, BUT I don't like the idea that random adults are going to \"getting to know\" him. EWWW!!!!! Back off!  I want my child to learn independence. I want to give him the dignity of autonomy in educational pursuits without my hovercraft presence, especially in the classroom. I  also don't think other peoples' children are any of my business. If my child becomes natural friends with children in his class or we choose to become involved in social organizations, then the get-to-know-you with families makes sense. Otherwise, it really bugs me that all of these people are going to have free access to be with my child, influence his education, and (frankly) feed an insatiable gossip monster. \n\nMy question is: Am I  the only parent out here with this perspective?",

This was uncomfortable for her when she went back to school, she felt very self conscious of it. She has a late birthday so she is older than most of her classmates. This year she has sprouted body hair on her legs vagina and  under her arms, which causes body odor usually on the days she has gym. I must remind her to put deodorant on. She\u2019s always so squeamish when talking about the importance of wearing a bra and now periods. She freezes up like a deer in headlights. I\u2019d rather talk about it before it happens than after. My mother never spoke with me about it but I was 10 and happened to be younger than most of my peers. I want her to feel as comfortable as possible talking about it while also being able to understand the importance of taking care of herself while at school when it is on. I must admit I\u2019m nervous about it for her too.",

            "selftext": "I am not a parent, and figured a parents advice would probably be more helpful on this. \n\nI live in a fairly rural college town, and currently go to university here. The majority of the housing is leased by college students, but here and there you\u2019ll se a family living in one. The rent on college housing is quite a good deal cheaper so it\u2019s generally far lower income families living in them (like $1200 a month for a 3 bedroom with a front yard). The parents of the family living next to me are not good people. \n\nEveryday when I walk by them, they are smoking weed and drinking in front of their small children playing in the yard. The children look to be around 7-8 and the parents age could be anywhere from 35-65, they have heavy facial scarring I imagine is from drug use making it hard to tell (the town I live in has a massive meth and heroin problem). \n\nMost of what I consider bad tendencies, smoking weed and drinking in front of their kids, swearing at them, telling their kids or significant other in front of the kids to shut the fuck up, I simply ignore. It\u2019s their life not mine. Today however was the second day in a row I walked by their house and listened to the very drunk father (this is at 2 pm), tell his two crying boys that \u201cif you both don\u2019t shut the fuck up right now, I\u2019m gonna beat the shit out of you and you\u2019ll be out on the street. Is that what you want?\u201d\n\nIm genuinely concerned for the children. Is it wrong of me to anonymously call cps? I have no idea what their family is like aside from the things I see and hear walk-in by the house on my way to and from classes or walking to the grocery store. However, threats of physical violence, abandonment, openly drinking and doing drugs in front of their children, and near constant screaming matches between the parents make me very concerned for their children\u2019s well being. \n\nIs it unreasonable for me to call cps? At what point would you?",

Let me start off by saying I will not stop contact, it's her right to see him.\nI don't visit his house often as he drops her off, but occasionally I get to see his house, and always leave shocked at the state of it. It stinks, can't put my finger on what the smell is, but it's overwhelming as soon as you walk in. It's a house share, although my daughter has her own room and there are no other tenants at the moment, but anybody could move in at any moment and I wouldn't know about it. The toilet seat is broken and the toilet doesn't flush, it has no heating in the winter, and some of the windows don't close, dirty plates / cups everywhere and just a general mess. My biggest concern is that there is no lock on the back door and he has flippantly told me that she goes out in the back garden after he has gone to bed!! He told me he was running her a bath (I doubt it), and she disappeared out the back door stark naked and he found her 2 doors down in the neighbours living room!! I asked my daughter about it, she says the neighbour invited her in for a drink, the worst thing possible springs to mind but I don't even what to think about what could have happened! I haven't voiced concerns to him yet, as up until now I thought it was dirty, but essentially she was safe and happy, and we all live to different standards. But what should I do?!",

But as the days went on I noticed a huge change in my husband. He was more loving and attentive to her than he has ever been with me or our son. He has been surrendering hisself with her. Calling to check on her , asking to talk with her, constantly smiling at her, watching movies, and she is always surrounding herself around him. She's a good kid, but she is intolerant towards our son and thrives on my husband's and I's attention. Am I reading to much into this? I feel like I'm going crazy. How can I feel jealousy towards a child. She comes from parents that put their happiness first. I know I shouldn't be so sensitive about it but I can't help but feel uneasy.",

They're okay with spending all that money treating themselves, but they can't be bothered to get their kids at least a small treat too? I see this happening almost every time I go to our neighborhood convenience store, and it makes me feel bad. Also, my grandma has seen this when she used to work there and totally agrees with me. Is this a common problem everywhere, or could it just be a local culture where I'm from? I'd like to know other parents' thoughts on this topic.",

Chore chart stands though. It used to have even more chores. We must do our daily chore before we can ask for our phones, which are in their rooms at night. If we dont get all weekly chores done, or even forget to do our daily once, we arent allowed our phones or video games for a week. Depending on how upset they are, we might not be allowed to go out either. \n\nIt's apparently unreasonable to be upset over the fact that they are constantly talking shit about us, mumbling under their breath, or snapping about chores because they're not done to their standards. \n\nA new development: I called off of work because I have school on weekdays, work on weekends. Every single day I either have school or work for 8 hours. I'm 15, a sophomore, and am in all advanced classes. My math class is a senior course. So I took the day off, because that's a lot of stress with no days off to just relax. I'm now banned from video games and most likely can't go anywhere.",

Plus, if im being honest, I'm going to be walking her and my son to school every day in the PNW weather (3 mile round trip, we don't have a car to use) and I want to postpone that mess for as long as possible. Now that school is starting the pre-k classes in just a few weeks I keep reading these horror story articles about people who let their kids skip pre-k and then their kids couldn't read or write until second grade and how skipping pre-k followed them into college years. This sounds stupid probably, but to my sleep deprived mommy brain I swear it seems like I've doomed her to introverted stupidity for the rest of her life \ud83d\ude16\ud83d\ude30\ud83d\ude2d Can somebody please tell me their kid skipped pre-k and didn't start reverting back to infanthood?",

            "selftext": "I've looked a little bit and see that this is a fairly common question, but I was hoping to get some insight into what's best vs what's good, and some stuff that may or may not be particular to my situation.\n\nWe are a couple of middle aged people living in the DC area. This is our first child and she will be 3 months old when it was planned for her to go into daycare. Recently my wife has become incredibly insistent on one-on-one care until at least one year of age going so far as be willing to quit her new, hard-found job.\n\nPart of it is this article (https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/going-beyond-intelligence/201702/preschool-nanny-parental-care-daycare-what-s-best) she read, but even there it says that at the end of the day, it's homelife that is most important. And we both have issues with that article in that it doesn't tell you how much better or worse the outcome is or how much you can go above the 30 hour/week daycare number or how much you should stay below.\n\nA large part of this is finances. The interim daycare we found is incredibly expensive at around $2700/mo (and that we've already paid the first month for), but it dovetails into our later daycare plans which will be a more reasonable $1700/mo, which will hopefully be sooner than later, but it's unclear exactly when (waitlists...). We haven't yet looked into the cost of a nanny, but I'd imagine in our area it's going to be at least $3k/mo. A nanny-share could be cheaper but logistically challenging.\n\nAside from the financial aspect, the $2700 daycare is across the street from her workplace and the $1700 daycare is IN my workplace. We went with the $2700 daycare because they're both in the same franchise and use the same system. Transferring from one to the other would be, as far as I can tell, seamless. I'm not sure what my wife would want to do if the $1700 daycare had availibilty before one year of age.\n\nI agree that one-on-one is \"best\", but daycare, particularly the one we'd be sending her to, is still \"good\". There is always something better and it's not like nannies don't have their cons. For context, she also insisted on spending $1k+ on cordblood storage, which in my opinion was a waste of money that I couldn't stop her on. But my question is how much worse is daycare to the development and care of our child, particularly at 3 months old? Are there any (other) studies/numbers that can quantify this?\n\nOne particular issue she had with daycare is that in that facility, she would be taken care of in not only a 1:4 ratio, but also that she'd be in a room with 11 other children, which could be noisy and stressful. That seems acceptable to me, particularly when you couple it with some pros like having backups for caregivers, etc... \n\nPart of my issue is that her decision-making appears to me to be colored by irrationality. How much of her insistence could be attributed to something like separation anxiety, which I understand is common? For instance, before she was all about moving into the city and buying an expensive house, and her career. Now, she's willing to put it all on hold, indefinitely if needs be (but not all the way to age 18). Contributing to this could be the fact that I've been back to work for over a month now and she's at home taking care of our child all day. On this point, I certainly could be helping more with childcare and decisions, but I do try.\n\nAnyway, that seems like enough, but hopefully not too much. Thanks for any help you can provide!",

            "selftext": "My boyfriend has a full time nanny for his kids (6 and 15 y.o. twins). Is that normal? It strikes me as odd because his kids are in school/camp most of the time. He isn't filthy rich. The nanny is $50,000 per year. It seems really bizarre and wasteful to me.\n\nHe lives in a suburb right outside NYC in a really modest small house with his ex wife (they're separated and live in separate bedrooms).\n\nHis wife *works from home full time* as a lawyer. His wife supposedly doesn't really have much work to do, she reads blogs all day.\n\nHe claims his wife \"bosses the nanny around all day\" while the wife stands in their small hallway--as the wife works from home. He says the nanny isn't a maid, he says the nanny is really there for the kids. The nanny does laundry and light cleanup, but it seems bizarre and unnecessary. The nanny also manages their weekly cleaning person. Again, they aren't filthy rich and they live in a tiny modest house.\n\nIt feels so weird to me. So when the kids are away at camp/school during the day (all year long), the nanny chills with the wife at their small house. Emphasis on \"small\" because it's not like the wife can escape the nanny for privacy.\n\nThe nanny's hours are M-F 7am-5pm. But the kids are at school or camp all day long.\n\nIs this a thing?? Is this abnormal and should I be concerned? I'm weirded out because my boyfriend is weirdly obsessed with the nanny drama (she's always fighting with his ex wife at the house daily or getting into his family's drama). It seems so weird to me due to how the nanny hardly sees the kids...why does he keep her full time?\n\nHe isn't super rich. Is it some weird thing I supposedly have no concept of due to my limited boring upbringing? My parents used babysitters that were only a few years older than me up until I was 10.\n\nI'm not worried he's inappropriately into the nanny.",

            "selftext": "**The Gist**: *My daughter hasn't spoken to me since she left for college last year, and I'm starting to miss her. I don't want her to be out of my life, however, I also understand that I don't own her and that she's free to live her own life. I just want to know if I should try to get into contact with her, or if I should just let her have her space.*\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* My husband and I have had a visibly rocky marriage for the past couple years, so there is a feint air of aggression that lingers through the house at all hours. During the last year that she was here, she would just hole herself up in her room so that she wouldn't have to deal with all of the muted drama. I suspect that she doesn't want to be around my husband and I since there's a chance we could get into a fight, especially since my husband wouldn't allow me to visit her without him being present.\n* She's in town now, but I don't know how long she'll be here for. I only found out that she's here because she stayed with my husband's sister for a night, the woman only told me after my daughter left. It seems like she's been sleeping on whoever's couch that she can.\n* The last time we talked she told me that she was going to send me a letter (*she has a romanticized view of snail mail*), and on it there was supposed to be some important things she wanted to tell me, but that letter never came. Instead, static. She wouldn't even respond to my holiday texts, not even on Christmas!\n* We spent a lot of time together before she left, and it seemed like things were going well between us. Besides one incident, our relationship has been without a blemish.\n\nFeel free to ask for more information, I only provided what I believed to be most relevant. Any help with this situation would be much appreciated.",

On top of that I came from a family where my sister and I HATED each other for years until we left for college and had our own space, so I look at her certainty suspiciously because well, my family didn't turn out like that, and I'm worried what would happen if her image of raising kids was found out to be wrong after 2+ kids are present. \n\nI've come around to kids, but still am of the belief let's have one, and then see how it goes. There is a reasonable chance that I might make it through toddler phase and just be like....kids are great but I don't want to deal with toddlers again. To which her response is basically the only acceptable reasons to not have kids #2 are if my pregnancies are likely to be life threatanig.\n\nI just feel like she has this starry eyes view of kids that may come true but is far less certain than she thinks.

I get home around 5:30.\n\nOur little girl has no behavioral issues and seems to be developing nicely (crawling, standing, almost walking, talking, etc.).\n\nEvery few months I'll look up what we should be doing with her, and every time I've seen that you shouldn't have the TV on. I was just reading in more detail, and it says that even having the TV on in the background isn't good. Does anyone actually abide by that? After we get home, one of us cooks dinner while the other one plays with the baby, then we all eat dinner together at the table. Then we play for about an hour, go for a walk, then snack and play some more before bed. Go up to her room, read, put her to bed.\n\nWhen we're playing before and after the walk, we usually put the TV on (but off when we're eating dinner) - nothing that would be inappropriate for a child to watch, but a show on the DVR that we want to watch, or a sporting event. We also have pictures constantly scrolling on our TV and she loves to look at those.\n\nI won't feel bad about it either way, but just curious to see what other parents think about the TV being.",

They don't really do any social media, so, it's me asking (19 y/old brother.)\n\nSo, it's only the third day of her sophomore year, but she's already throwing huge 2-hour long temper tantrums, and my mom has had to physically drag her out of bed (which is difficult to even succeed at because she is almost the same size/taller then my mom) and do all of this while she has to go to work in a few hours.\n\nLast year she got so many tardys/absences we had a truancy officer show up to our house, so, letting her be is literally not an option.\n\nOur family has a history of anxiety/depression issues, and I know hormones and high school makes it even worse.  Last year, my parents got her a therapist to prescribe medication, but she is very anti-medication and basically stopped taking it as time went on (I know medication is what got me through high school, so should we try to convince her to get back on?)\n\nI know they are attempting to get her accommodations at school, but are not quite sure how to go about it.  They know how to get a meeting with the school, but I know people's needs are very individual to themselves.  But also, my sister doesn't even know what she herself wants, other than to not go.\n\nIn school she is very quiet, has trouble asking for things, and is very anxious about other people and the lunch room.  The amount/load of school work and homework is also something she struggles with. (She is in all regular classes.) She also has a bit of an issue with authority, calling her teachers and the school counselors things like b*tches when she's at home.  That's all I really know because it's hard to get her to even talk about the topic of school without her hysterically yelling \"I can't go!\"  \n\nThey've tried rewards, taking privileges away, and are in the process of trying to get another therapist (as we had moved last year for my dad's job)\n\nIt's a bit of a small town school, so they probably don't have much of a precedent for dealing with mental health issues, so any advice I could give to my parents would probably help.\n\n::\n\ntl;dr Dropping out is not a legal option yet, so what accommodations helped your teenager with anxiety feel better about going to school?",

She's a nice girl from the neighborhood and has proven to be a good babysitter since last year and as well as a good friend to our son. Few days ago while we were out on evening she decided to paint his face and hands for fun. This all seemed cute until my son told me she also painted eyes and a hat on his pubic area so his penis would look like the nose and said it was supposed to be pinocchio. My wife thought it was cute and funny but I don't know to me it seems inappropriate for her to do this. I later asked my wife if she felt it was inappropriate and she says I'm overreacting and brought up the fact that our sitter also helps him bathe and get changed into pajamas and that if I'm ok with that I should be ok with this too. I didnt wanna argue with her further do I decided to ask here. Do you guys think its appropriate and am I overreacting?",

We both have 50% custody 1 week on and 1 week off.\n\nMy daughter is turning 9 in a couple months and wanting more privacy which is good, she's been very specific with the clothes she wants to wear and hasn't been wearing any of her loose fitting/wavy shirts lately.  My daughters cousin wears training bras that my sister got her because she was \"budding\", they're both the same age. My daughter noticed this and my wife said she was also \"budding\". \n\nNonetheless, I took her to target and had her pick out 3 training bras. Today she's wearing her wavy/loose fitting shirts and feels more comfortable. She just went home to mom today. \n\nI have now gotten several messages from mom saying I shouldn't have done that since I'm a \"man\" and this was something for her to do and she would have done it when she thought the time was right. \n\nI told her I didn't think it was much of an issue since I'm pretty open with my daughter and have gotten her deodorant and whatever else she needs and I would rather have her not feel self conscious with what she wears. But she is still going on about how I shouldn't have done it since this is a \"Mother\" thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what do you other parents say? I mean this is 2019, I don't see anything wrong with a father helping out with this kind of stuff?",

Also that there are no consequences when he does steal something. \nIt upsets her because she doesn't want our daughter to think it's ok to steal and that she can get away with it.\n\nI've told her \"I think you are looking way to into this. If you're concerned about Swiper then that gives us the opportunity to explain that this kids show and that steal is never ok.\" Her response \" then you don't understand how impressionable kids are.\"  \nNot disagreeing with her on how impressionable kids are. It bothers me that she doesn't apply that same level of concern to the kids shows that she likes. \n\nI could use the logic she is trying to pull and pick out all the little things from the kids shows that she wants our daughter to watch. But im not sure if the message will get through. I know she'll will take it the wrong way. \n\nI feel like she is trying to do away with Dora because she doesn't like that show in general. She finds it really annoying. Also her dad was the first one to point out that he is against our daughter watching Dora. He doesn't like Swiper stealing things and there are no consequences afterwards.\nHe too finds the show very annoying.\n\nHow should I approach this if my wife continues to press the issue?",

We love her dearly however we\u2019ve only experienced the good parts where we meet her and spend a couple of hours together. Other than that we\u2019ve no experience really with children. \n\nFrom a biological function, if we do want kids then it\u2019s better to have one as soon as possible. \n\nWith regard to financials, both my wife and I are doing well in our jobs however I\u2019m not sure how the equation changes with one more being coming into existence. \n\nOnce couples become parents they always say it\u2019s worth it.

It isn't for any reason that involves them, I just really don't feel my birth name fits me at all, and my new name is very important to my sense of identity. I haven't gone by my birth name with my friends or online in years. If you're a parent, how would you react? Should I tell them seriously before it goes through, or just wait until they find out and then mention it offhandedly when they ask so it isn't a big deal? I won't be asking them to address me by my new name, so it isn't something they necessarily need to know, but they're going to find out eventually. tyvm",

We have talked about having kids at some point, and mostly about having a son. \n\nThe other day the topic was brought up about circumcision (weird I know lol) and I asked my boyfriend if he would want to circumcise our son if we had one, and he said yes. \n\nNow, I don't personally think its okay to circumcise my own kid. If I wouldn't do it to my daughter I wouldn't do it to my son. I told this to my boyfriend, to which he said that uncircumcised penises are harder to clean. Which I won't deny that isn't a bit true, but the same applies to vaginas and even circumcised penises.  You still have to put in effort to clean, and I don't think teaching my son to clean himself would be hard. And I said that if our son wanted to be circumcised when he's older hes free to, but I won't make that choice for him or mutilate him. \n\nMy boyfriend still thinks it would be better to circumcise our son, and I disagree. \nSo we wanted to get some insight from parents and see what might be best or if we can somehow compromise.",

Either your talking to a person who hates kids and never wants them and espouses all the terrible things about raising kids, or you have the exact opposite. You have people that put parenting in such a positive light it feels like they are hiding the reality because of some ulterior motive like I WANT GRANDKIDS, or I WANT TO JUSTIFY MY REGRETFULLY DESCISIONS OF HAVING KIDS. I am not saying everyone who does this has ulterior motives, but when things get spun so hard in one way or another it just looks like they have ulterior motive.\n\nFrom my perspective society says you will never understand parenthood and then does it's best to hide the realities of parenthood until it's imminent. Maybe I'm missing something but that's what it looks like.\n\nWhat is some stuff both good and bad that people should know about parenting, both good and bad, that would help them be better informed while making one of the most important descisions in their lives?",

I have a few more questions than what I put in the title though.\n\nMy mother has grounded me from this day (August 6, 2019 until May of 2020.) \n\nIt sounds like I did something extremely bad right? Like I committed a hate crime or stole hundreds of dollars.\n\nYesterday I had moved some Bath and Body Works Shower Gel from my laundry room to my bathroom. I decided that I was going to use it in my shower.\n\nWhen I started my shower, I decided not to use the gel because it was probably a bad idea. I then placed it inside my cabinet to put up later so it wouldn\u2019t get moist all over it.\n\nHowever, I forgot to put it back inside the laundry room bag because I got distracted and started cleaning up my bathroom and room before my parents got back home.\n\nThis morning for around 4 hours I had got screamed at, insulted, and grounded. Because of the soap. \n\nI apologized and told her I didn\u2019t use any and I forgot to put it back. She\u2019s been calling me a thief and screaming so loud to the point to where I have to cover my ears.\n\nI didn\u2019t try arguing with her. I kept asking why she was doing this. I even handed her my phone and didn\u2019t try to start anything.\n\nPARENTS! I have a few questions. \n\n1) Is this a reasonable punishment for me?\n\n2) If your TEENAGER did this, would you give the same punishment and act the same way?\n\n3) Do you know why she may be doing this? \n\n4) How should I try and fix this? What makes parents happy?\n\n\nMore info: \nI understand that maybe this could be reasonable if I have a bad habit of stealing. I do not steal though. I have occasionally used a dab of her face wash when I ran out. I haven\u2019t stolen from stores, or anything extremely bad. \n\nI wasn\u2019t trying to steal the soap though. I didn\u2019t use any and I forgot to put it back up. \n\nShe thinks I\u2019m stealing/have stole from stores, stole cash, and stole alcohol. All of which I HAVE not done.\n\nMy mom is not on drugs. She\u2019s the really typical suburban white entitled mom. I guess? \n\nThank you.",

Yesterday he was playing in a little tunnel and when he got to the bottom he just sat there playing with something on the ground. Another toddler on the other end of the tunnel looked like he wanted to go through and before I had a chance to do anything, this kid's nanny just walked over, picked up my son and moved him over a few feet. My son didn't mind, it happened so fast I don't think he really noticed but I was kind of taken aback that this woman felt totally fine picking up a baby she doesn't know. Does this seem out of line to anyone else? \nIt got me thinking about what's ok and not ok to do at the park. I've seen parents who won't let their kids share any toys at the park and others who feel like anything that's brought to the park is fair game. I know some parents will step in and scold other children when there's a conflict and others who think it's better to talk to the nanny/caretaker if there's a problem. What sort of park etiquette do you follow? How do you communicate your rules or preferences to others at the park or other public play areas if they do something you're not comfortable with?",

            "selftext": "Help!  I am looking for advice about whether to ask grandma to be nanny or to put LO into daycare.  This is our first and I will be going back to work fulltime when he is ~7 months old (\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f my employer!).\n\nMy mom is willing to nanny and this seems like a good option for his care.  The reason I\u2019m not sure is that she has always been WAY too emotionally dependent/needy toward me and my siblings (codependent I\u2019d say).  I feel like she is already starting to act this way toward our LO (first grandkid on both sides, poor kid).  I feel like she is trying to relive her \u2018mom days\u2019 and she keeps reminding me those were the best years of her life.  She doesn\u2019t have much else going on and has been more or less waiting for us to give her grandkids.  My 2 siblings and I all moved across the country probably largely due to her pressure on us for emotional connection.  I am now moving back so that we can have more family support (my inlaws are also there and are lovely).  I think if she is his nanny she will completely re-order her life around him in an unhealthy obsessive way.  \n\nI know he is just a baby so won\u2019t be too affected for at least a few years, so should I just ignore that it bothers me and kind of freaks me out as it is probably better for him to get such loving 1-1 care?  Or compromise and do it until he is a bit older then switch to daycare?  \n\nThe daycare is supposed to be great and both options are financially reasonable, so it just is about what would be best for LO and myself and partner.  Worried there may be some boundary issues with her kind of trying to be his mom (not necessarily not following our parenting choices, more like her trying to have his first word be \u201cnana\u201d and be the one he goes to for comfort, etc).\n\nAny advice or thoughts are welcome and much appreciated!!",

When many of them were questioned why they believed this, they usually replied with stating that because they were beaten as children and turned out okay, that it only seems right for them to beat their children for the mistakes they will make. \n\nI am disheartened that so many feel that this is the only way to punish their children, so I wanted to ask parents, or even the general public, what methods of discipline do you use (or methods your parents used if you have no children) that don\u2019t require physically punishing your children? \n\nHopefully these responses will give people some ideas of more constructive forms of discipline rather than immediately resorting to beating their kids.",

            "selftext": "I've been with my girlfriend for around 7 and a half months, and met her daughter a few weeks into the relationship.\n\nI currently have my own apartment, but we're planning to move in together near the end of this month, so I don't really stay there anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer ex has a weird job schedule and so we end up having her daughter 3-5 days out of the week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBecause it's summer, her grandparents or her dad usually has her during the day when we are at work, and we'll have her at night on nights that she stays with us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer daughter goes to bed around 8-8:30, and when it's time for bed, she always runs and jumps onto our bed and says she wants to sleep there that night. It's 100% of the time she actually tries to sleep in the same bed. My girlfriend doesn't always allow it, but there are exceptions. One being when she hasn't had her for a while, because she's been on vacation and she misses her, then she'll let her..and I don't really have any problem with that - I totally get it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy problem is that her daughter doesn't see it as an exception, and that it's just more of the norm. When my girlfriend and her ex split up, she moved into an apartment (then later bought a house), and her and her daughter would regularly sleep in the same bed. I think because of the circumstances surrounding their separation (she pretty much just walked out because it was beyond over), she feels immensely guilty and doesn't want to be seen as a bad parent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA night doesn't go by that her daughter doesn't try at least one tactic to get into bed with us - she \"had a bad dream\" or \"is afraid of the dark\" etc. Sometimes it'll be early AM (2-4 AM) where she'll come in our room and try to get into bed with us.. other times it will be a bit after we've put her down, she'll come in saying she can't sleep but I feel like it's almost always a way to try and get into bed with us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis whole situation feels really complex - maybe her daughter is dealing with feelings of me coming between them/taking her mom away from her, or that she thinks her mom's love for her can go away like it did with her dad - I don't really know. She lets her daughter get away with a lot and only cracks down when she's (her daughter) absolutely flipped her shit - her daughter doesn't have any manners (hits, chews loudly with mouth open, loudly licks/sucks fingers when eating, smacks us on the butt, farts and announces it,  etc) and her mom doesn't do anything about it. Is this just how kids act, and it's okay to let them do that because they'll grow out of it, or should she be doing more to curb these behaviors? I realize there are multiple things in this post.. but I'm just venting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks!",

She does however, LOVE to eat. \nWe try to be careful in choosing our words when we speak to her about it. My mother fat shamed me as a child, so I know what kind of emotional havoc it can have on such a young mind. \nWe speak to her about making healthy choices, which she\u2019s very good at. The problem we have is teaching her moderation, but it\u2019s something we work on daily. \nMy mother takes it upon herself to tell my daughter she\u2019s fat, she\u2019s getting fatter by the day (she\u2019s not), and other things like \u201cyou\u2019ll be as big as a house\u201d or \u201cno boys will like you!\u201d Keep in mind, she\u2019s TEN. \nAt this point I feel the only thing I can do is keep her away from my mother, but I\u2019m afraid the damage has been done. This started when she was around 8 years old and no amount of reasoning with my mother has helped. \nWe are on waiting lists for a few counselors, but adolescent psychotherapy is hard to find in our area. \nI just don\u2019t know what else to do. \nIf you made it this far, I appreciate you listening and any advice you may have.",

It was a typical nice family weekend. Then they go back to their mom's Sunday night and Monday morning I get a call from my youngest saying she only wants it to be me and the girls. This doesn't connect for me. I must be missing something here, they are rarely ever alone with her so I know how they interact.\n\nI'm at a loss on how to handle it.

            "selftext": "First of all, please excuse my english, I will use wordreference a lot so I am not sure it will be correctly written. It is my first post on reddit and I hope I will not make your eyes bleed ! \n\n  \nI have a 16 years old girl that I raised by myself, her mother died when she was a baby. But even if I never wanted a child, I fell in love at the moment I saw my daughter and globally I feel really good about my baby girl, she's an awesome child making my life easier. We always had a great relationship, a lot of complicity and I genuinely enjoy sharing moments with her.  \nI know I am not objective here, but I have to say it : my girl is the best, she works hard at school, has nice dreams (she wants to be veterinary since always), volunteers in an animal protecting society, and avoided dumb stuff (drugs, alcohol, bad boys) so far. What else could I ask ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut lately, I met a woman that I like for the first time in years and something changed. My girl is acting weirdly to me, I have this strange feeling that she is jealous and is trying to seduce me. Do not get me wrong, I am not talking about some sick fantasy here, it is more that she is acting like the woman of the house protecting her territory, and goes too far in it.\n\nFor example, my GF and I are on the couch and my girl comes between us, even pushes my GF sometimes (she makes some joke when doing that, but the result is all the same : she pushed my GF away). That would be a regular and even cute \"get off my daddy\" if she would not add some \"caress\" on my chest or my leg when cuddling. She even kisses and hugs me a lot more than before, especially when my GF is around.\n\nAnother example is the way she talks to me (like an adult or when she makes compliment on my looking, she did not do that before) and the fact that she wants to do her laundry herself. I know a girl needs some privacy, especially at that age, but why now ? Maybe it is a coincidence and has nothing to do with the new woman's arrival, I do not know...   \nShe also walks around in pants and small vest top, getting a lot of my neighbour's son attention by the way (he climbs on the garden's wall to watch in our house or looks through the window from the street). I told her to not come out of her room in pants, that she is quite a woman and has curves that society forbids to show, but she always answers \"it's only you and me here, when B\u00e9atrice \\[my GF\\]  is not around\". What can I answer to that ? I chose to simply forbid her to show herself barely naked, but she regularly needs to be called to order.\n\nMore serious : she recently searched in my PC (\"for fun and curiosity\" she said) and found out that I watched naked women's pictures and lesbian porn (I do not feel ashamed about this, I am a simple man, single for a long time, with needs and watching pictures of beautiful women is not extreme stuff at all in my opinion) and she got mad about it.   \nThe fact that she crossed the line and violated my privacy apart, I am worried about her reaction. She truly made a scene as if she was my wife, especially about the lesbian thing, questioning my fantasies and the age of the women I am attracted to (as if I was a pervert), and I believe she should have been embarrassed, not mad. Now I have to protect my computer and phone with a password.\n\nAnother thing, more vague, is that she does not have a boy/girlfriend. I know as a father I have a biased judgement, but I also know that she is a beautiful young girl (she looks a lot like her mother, who was the most beautiful woman I ever met).   \nShe has boys \"stalking\" her on social medias (I do not spy, I watch her public posts, I just want to make sure everything is alright), many ask her out and I a lot of other adults are making me compliments about her looking and behaviour. My cousin, a 30yo man, has recently made some salacious comments about her with the approval of other men around, all family members, fantastic... He did know I was hearing him.   \nSo, as weird my sources are, I know she is attractive to men and could have a BF or a GF, the question is \"should she already have one ?\". I asked her if she had a special someone, I even told her that she can love a girl or a transgender or anyone, I will love her all the same, but she just answered \"I did not find the good one\". Seems ok to me if I do not make the connection with all the other strange points.\n\nThe last thing that hoisted a red flag was a \"mms\" she sent me. We usually text a lot, even sharing some pictures of funny things, but she recently sent me a selfie of her in a dress she wanted. This was the first and only selfie (so far) that she sent to me. She used the \"can I buy it ?\" as a pretext I think, because she has her own money I give her and she can always buy what she wants, she never asked me the authorization to buy some clothes. Also, the picture was too much suggestive to my taste, taken from above and showing her cleavage. Plus, it was not an unusually dress for her, she was not worried about any provocative aspect so I still wonder why she wanted my agreement.  \nShe also adds a lot of hearts, \"kissing emojis\" and \"I love you\" to her texts now, while before she was even embarrassed when I told her \"I love you\", now she writes to me barely every day such nice messages. Do girls send that kind of pics and texts to their dad ? I am a bit lost... \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe did not do that before my GF appeared, and I do not know how to tell her I feel uncomfortable about it. I do not want her to feel rejected and I am not sure I am not misinterpreting her behaviour, exaggerating things...   \nI only want her to have a happy life and allow her to meet someone she will love, this seems impossible if she falls into the \"love game\" with her father. I saw that happen between my brother and my mother, they were too close and my brother has never been happy in his love life because of too high expectations. He did not marry before our mother's death, and even after he wanted, unconsciously, his wife to act like our mother, with a LOT of care and no asking in exchange. I do not know if I am understandable here. To say it quick : I do not want my girl to be in love with me. (it is really awkward to \"say it aloud\")  \nSo here I come to get this off my chest and get some advice, because I do not want to talk about that with the women I know in real life, I fear that they would judge my girl and/or me, think that I have some weird fantasy or something like that...   \nFellow women/girls of reddit, how would you like your daddy, with whom you have a fusional relationship, to impose some limits on the affection ? Is there a combination of words that would not make my girl sad, feel rejected or destroy our bond ?   \nI really need help here. Thank you.",

Firstly, English is not my first language so please excuse any odd phrases or grammar errors. \n\n \nI don\u2019t have kids, but two of my friends are pregnant. One for the first time, the other for the second time. I live far far away and won\u2019t be able to visit them before or for a while after their babies are born (in the autumn, about a month apart), but I really wanted to give them something to show how much I love and support them. The problem is that I don\u2019t really have a clue what..? My friends who live closer have already thought of a gift for the babies, so that\u2019s sorted.\n\nSo I was wondering if you seasoned parents of Reddit have any inside tips for me? Did you get anything that was helpful and considerate postpartum? Was there anything you wished someone had given you, or that you missed during the first few months? Keep in mind that I won\u2019t be able to physically be there for my friends, so there have to be items/gift cards/services I can email or send per post etc. If there is anything that could benefits both parents, that would be great too!  \n\nThanks!",

I didn\u2019t make a big deal out of it though. I just told him that it was for adults and that it was acting. For a few weeks/months, his curiously was piqued and so I saw that he was looking up cartoon characters doing it. That ran its course so let\u2019s skip ahead a few years. He\u2019s been watching very graphic porn and I don\u2019t know what to do. Sexuality is perfectly normal and I don\u2019t want to make him feel guilty because he\u2019s interested in it. I just don\u2019t want him to think that what he\u2019s seeing on Pornhub is \u2018normal\u2019. I\u2019m a single mom and his dad is around some, but he\u2019s never been a parent. He works off so he comes in every few months, takes the kids out to eat, maybe a movie, and that\u2019s where his parenting ends. What\u2019s the best way to approach my son about this without scarring him for life?",

He\u2019s doesn\u2019t pay rent because he\u2019s currently unemployed but he does go to school full time and is a theater student so his father and I don\u2019t want him to drive himself crazy. He\u2019s generally a good kid, sometimes he and his father butt heads but other than that he helps out.\n\nMy son has been dating his boyfriend for about 4 months, he\u2019s 26, has a good job, is very sweet and is good for my son. We really like him. Although my husband and I started arguing about a policy we have.\n\nWe are Christian parents but some of our children (2, perhaps 3 out of 4) aren\u2019t Christian themselves. We fully accept my son as a gay man and are happy that he is happy but sex before marriage in our house is a line we had with the kids for a while. In order to enforce this, we didn\u2019t allow any of our kids to sleep in the same bed in their rooms with their SO. They could however sleep on the couch in the living room together.\n\nGranted, the rule was made when they were in high school and when we had a nice section for their guests to sleep on to avoid staying in the same bed.\n\nOur son and his bf (the bf unknowingly so) have broken this rule 3 times. We don\u2019t know that they had sex but we suspect it. However we\u2019ve been able to see that my son and his bf have slept in the same bed together when he has come over. \n\nMy husband and I have argued over this. I\u2019m in favor of abolishing the rule as our son is an adult and does very well in school and constantly impresses is with his performances. Where he is a much more strict \u201cour house our rules\u201d type approach.\n\nI should also say that my son has somewhat of a makeshift room, he initially went to a Christian school out of state, but after coming out and leaving religion they treated him very badly. However in our 3 bedroom home, we have his old room to his younger sister when he moved out. To compensate we put up a partition and a small gate to keep the dogs out in the play room. We can\u2019t see into his room from the living room, but we can if we try to enter the garage.\n\nHis bf also currently lives at home with much stricter parents, I\u2019m not sure why this is, but I can suspect it\u2019s just to save money, my sons bf seems to be very frugal and smart with his money. Although I know he and my have talked about eventually moving to a nearby city after this upcoming semester.\n\nI\u2019m wondering if any of you have had similar scenarios and can shed light on the situation.",

So here it is again. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I am curious what people think and why they name they children as they do.\n\nPlease remember that your child LIVES with it. It is often difficult to change your name cause you feel you have grown and its part of who you are. Even if your parent's didn't think about it much.\n\nI've lived in Australia my whole life. I am a 23 year old young man and my name is Tara.My Parents are Scottish and German. My dad had never heard the name before and in Scotland is a unisex name so my mother thought it was normal and a 'beautiful name'. To be named after the hill of Tara. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill\\_of\\_Tara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_of_Tara)\n\nFor as long as I can remember from being a young child to now every time I meet someone they ask me twice or three times \"sorry? Tara? Whats the meaning behind that? Isnt that normally a girls name\".I grew up in kindergarden, primary, high school every day \"You've got a girls name\" so immediately from Day 1 I seemed to become bully's targets. Even now at work, work can be especially uncomfortable.\n\nI grew up hating introducing myself, school assemblies and public speaking I always thought \"please dont call my name\" cause all the kids would snicker.Once or twice it wouldn't be so bad. But even now its almost everyday, consistently for FUCKING YEARS. A small thing over time can be so mentally draining.\n\nGirls while I was growing up would also tease me \"Tara the girl!\" and all that kinda shit.I've never gotten over that. I know I shouldn't feel like this but I am really struggling how to approach women especially because whenever I do its all I think about.\n\nI don't want to change it. Someone's I do. But I also feel its part of who I am. I have no idea how you even choose on identifying yourself with a different name.\n\nPerhaps I shouldn't but because I grew up thinking I needed to detach, isolate myself from others I've grown up to be so introverted and scared of how others perceive me because of my name I've become quite lonely. I know I shouldn't blame that only on my name but sometimes you are your life's experiences right?And people still say that's a girls name. So its not in my head.\n\nMy friends tell me I should go to therapy to try and conquer my feelings. But how do you overcome something as attached to you as your name. Whatever I do it's still going to follow me around. If I do change my name I'm still going to be the same person with the same experiences.\n\nJust please. Your child is the one that lives with it.\n\nI just wanted to tell someone.I am really interested as what people think.",

One time at school she had to have the nurse come get her in a wheelchair just because her period cramps were that bad. Yet her parents refuse to start her on the pill. At least her mom said she\u2019d think about it, but nothing has come of that. She knows the side effects and she\u2019s okay with them, and we already know that on her 18th I\u2019ll drive her to the doctor, but she still has 4 periods until then and i hate seeing her in this much pain. I just don\u2019t understand knowing that you can help someone and refusing to do so because of your values. Is there something I\u2019m missing? From a parents point of view, is there any logic behind it or are they just scared of her having sex? (Which again, we do anyways).",

My friend just had a beautiful baby boy (born 12:30 this morning!!), and got me wondering. I'd like to get them some gifts. However, I'd rather not get the usual baby blankets, diapers and cute pacifiers.  While they're all useful, of course, I'd like to get something that would help them *save time, and reduce stress and/or work* (every little bit helps!).  I guess an adult corollary would be a buying someone a dishwasher, rather than dish soap, a pack of sponges and a hanger....I'm not sure if it makes sense.\n\nI guess another way to phrase this would be: 'what item did you wish you had (or you wish you have), but never did, when you first had a baby?'",

He claims it's for safety because I'm going to be driving soon, but I'm only taking drivers Ed so I won't legally allowed to drive on my own till November. I haven't ever snuck out, drank, or done drugs so he doesn't have a reason not to trust me. I'm going to NYC(1 hour train ride from me) with 5 other people this weekend and he said I couldn't go without the app which is understandable, but he wants it on all the time after that. I feel incredibly violated and I'm starting to resent him for it. I know I could just use a fake location tracker, but I honestly don't have anything to hide. I hate how the app logs everywhere you go so even if he's not checking the app he can see exactly where I go. I'm at a point in my life where I should be becoming more independent but I feel like I'm being treated like a child with no reason for it. What should I do?",

I have had several colleagues who are parents, and some of the things they've said about the things they keep from their kids has surprised me. Examples:\n\n* \"Yeah, I used to listen to punk but I stopped when I had kids.\" \n\n* \"I came home and he was watching the news--he can't watch the news! There's so much bad stuff on the news!\" (Her son was 9 or 10.) \n\n* \"SpongeBob isn't allowed in our house.\" (Her kids were 5 and 12.) \n\n* \"She's not allowed to read Twilight until high school, and even then I don't really want her reading that stuff.\" (Her daughter was 12 or 13.)\n\nThese are just some of the things that have stood out for me from various people. I guess a lot of it comes down to personal values and parenting styles, and also it depends on your child's maturity and sensitivity to certain content. And I suppose a great deal of this is the desire to preserve the innocence of youth for as long as possible? I wonder if my feelings on some of these things will change when I eventually become a parent. \n\nHow do you as a parent decide what to censor/what not to? Or do you just find yourself naturally setting boundaries without consciously deciding what is appropriate? Has your philosophy about it changed/evolved since before having kids?",

For example, as long as I can remember, she made me wear preppy designer clothes. My dad has a pretty lucrative job, so she has lots of money for these. Now I am 14 and the number of things I hate she is forcing me into or is increasing. She thinks these things will make me socially popular in school, and I don't care about popularity. Here is a list of these things:\n\n* Making me learn to play electric guitar -- I never liked guitar, and hate it more now that I am forced to do it\n* Making me learn to skateboard -- I don't like the skateboarding and I think it can be dangerous\n* Making me learn to play basketball -- I don't enjoy basketball or sports in general\n* Making me work out at the gym -- She always pushes me over my limits so I can have a hunky body, and even my pediatrician told her to stop overworking me\n* Making me wear cologne every day -- I find cologne to be overpowering and don't like the smell of it\n* Making me wear an haircut I hate -- I don't like the way it feels or looks\n* Making me wear trendy designer clothes -- I hate the way I look in them\n* Making me talk to girls -- I'm not interested in girls at this stage in my life, but my mom forces me to talk to them\n* Making me attend every party and social event -- I'm not interested in parties and would rather spend a quiet evening at home\n\nThe punishment for not following her ridiculous parameters or EVEN PROTESTING THEM is that she will kick me out of the house for a week. School is unimportant to her -- I don't like this attitude because I enjoy school and want to be a scientist when I grow up. However, I've learned to live with all these things -- it's not my ideal life, but I have to do them if I want shelter. However, recently she came up with such a horrible, terrible idea I would NEVER consider at this point and I feel I am too young for.  **She's going to make me sleep with a young adult female friend of hers.** It has made me reconsider how comfortable I am at home. I hate this idea and would never do it at this point in my life. She is serious about this, and there is even a date set. She also bought me some special underwear for this. I have no idea what to do. I talked with my school guidance counselor, but he didn't give me much advice. I also talked to my dad, but he just said \"listen to your mother, that's what's easiest\". I have absolutely no support, and I am too scared to talk to my mom. Advice!?",

A year ago, they joined the same academy for grappling (no gi and bjj ). They have been assigned separate batches and never compete with each other in tournaments. At home, though, they frequently grapple and my son habitually emerges victorious, much to our disappointment.\n\nI am particularly worried that my daughter might be unconsciously developing a defeatist attitude. Yesterday, I actually witnessed one of their bouts. My son held his sister in such a position where she could barely breathe. He released her only after she tapped him on his shoulder. Despite all this, my daughter gave him a hug and congratulatory kiss on the cheek. My son has in fact nicknamed his sister \"the loser\" and my daughter never protests. Is she suffering from some kind of identity crisis?",

If you check my history you'll see the post; I think it's still there just locked. \n\nI have seen some photos of the child and she does resemble me, her age would line up with the time period during which I was seeing her mother (although it was never exclusive), and now we are just waiting for paternity tests and all of that legal sort of crap to be sorted so that I can know for sure she is mine and go become a part of her life.\n\nShe's 2 and 3/4 years old. I know her age matters in how I should approach her. What should I tell her? Should I try to explain that  I didn't know she was out there and that as soon as I found out, I came to see her? Should I even tell her I'm her father, or just pretend I am some other relative such as an uncle? She's been raised by her mother's parents until now but they're not in the best of health and cannot continue to care for her so I have to figure out how to arrange care for her as well. \n\nI am not telling myself that she is certainly mine as there is a decent chance she's not. But she has my teeth (in baby form) and I have rather unique teeth, as well as my eyes and eyebrows so I think she's likely mine, haha. I have absolutely no idea how to assimilate a small person into my life but I will do my best to make sure she is well cared for and happy.

We\u2019ve talked about what we\u2019re excited to show our son and teach him, how we want to raise him, all that stuff. \n\nLately, I\u2019ve been reading a lot of negative posts about having kids and it\u2019s sent me in a downward spiral feeling like we made the wrong decision. I\u2019m more scared than I\u2019ve been this whole pregnancy that either our kid is going to suck, it\u2019s going to change our lives for the worse, our relationship is going to suffer, etc. I realize everyone\u2019s experience with child-rearing is different and I definitely feel for those who are going through it, but it\u2019s really difficult to constantly see the negative aspects of it- which I also realize is partly my fault for always reading those posts. \n\nTL;DR: Can anyone provide some positives about having a kid?",

            "selftext": "Hi, this is a little long so bear with me (TLDR at bottom). I just had my first year in college living at the dorms and had a blast. I felt like I grew a lot in terms of how to manage my time, be more social and friendly to others, being more independent, and also being less fearful of making phone calls (haha). Mentally, I felt much happier and more confident in myself (I struggled a lot with self esteem issues growing up). \n\nUnfortunately, when I came back from the dorms this summer I found myself feeling depressed, lonely, and bored a lot of the time. One issue I face is going out of the house. I got my license in January of my high school senior year but I'm not allowed to drive unless one of my parents is in the car. Sometimes there are days where I just want to hang out at a coffee shop or library rather than stay cooped up in my house, but my mom (my dad is usually working)is usually not up for accompanying me in the car if I'm not going anywhere without much of a purpose.  I don't blame her for not wanting to go with me, as she can't help it if she's not interested in going out and she isn't obligated to. Yet I feel trapped in the house and, as silly as it sounds, feel like I'm wasting my life being in the house all day long. To make things worse, I recently got a job and my mom has to drive me there, but I feel like she has to go out of her way to do so since she has other responsibilities to tend to and I feel really guilty for making her do so. When I lived in the dorms, I could walk to the library to study/ hang out or even just take a walk around campus if I didn't want to stay in my dorm. \n\nAnother scenario would be hanging out with friends. Ever since I was a kid, if I hung out with a guy friend or acquaintance(never one-on-one/ always with another female friend or in a group) my parents would ask if I have any romantic interests in him. I had a boyfriend in the past and kept it hidden in fear of them being angry, but they eventually found out. They weren't very angry, more concerned, but I would guess it would create further distrust. During college, I made some guy friends that I hung out with a lot and while I used to be afraid to talk to guys, I no longer have that fear. However recently, when I mentioned my friend, A (male), in a conversation, my mom asked me if I had feelings for him. I don't have feelings for him, nor am I interested in dating at the moment (I feel like I need to really focus on myself for a couple years), and I felt awkward and embarrassed when she mentioned that. So I was wondering if its normal for parents to ask that question whenever their daughter has a guy friend or not.\n\nMy parents have good intentions. I know they care a lot about me and my sibling and want the best for us. They always invest a lot of money in our education to make sure we get the best kind and push academics as a priority. But sometimes I feel like overall happiness and success is more than just academics and things like a social life can really contribute to it. So what boundaries do you set for your 19 year old regarding when they go out to hang with friends or just stay out?\n\nTLDR: After staying in the dorms for freshman year, I miss the freedom I had there and was wondering what are some normal boundaries parents have for a 19 year old who lives at home.",

            "selftext": "I was on Facebook today and saw a post about finding sunscreen that's easy for a young child to apply without assistance. As summer vacation has arrived or is fast approaching, parents are dealing with summer camps that have one rule about sunscreen: adults are not allowed to assist in applying.  \n\n\nPersonally, I think that is absolutely insane. As an adult, you better believe that if I'm at the beach or pool, I'm going to turn to a friend or a stranger who looks nice and ask \"Hey, can you help get my back?\" or \"I'll help with your back if you help with mine.\"  \n\n\nI have very sensitive skin. I am fully aware that, one day, I will have to face the ramifications of the multiple sunburns I've experienced over the years (including a couple that blistered pretty badly). I wouldn't wish that kind of pain on anyone- especially not a young child.   \n\n\nSome camps are willing to spray sunscreen on backs, but I do not trust aeresol sunscreen. It's very difficult to ensure full coverage, and when sunsceen is applied/reapplied outdoors,any breeze can lead to large patches of skin being missed. (The last time I used a spray sunscreen, I ended up with second-degree sunburn).   \n\n\nApplying once in the morning isn't going to be enough- especially when children are spending hours outdoors sweating or exposed to water.   \n\n\nTeach your child how to apply sunscreen to his/her own arms and legs, but I still think that it's perfectly reasonable for a camp counselor to help get hard-to-reach spots or make sure that nothing was missed.   \n\n\nIf you do not trust your child's counselors enough to help apply sunscreen to areas not covered by a swimsuit \\[isn't the general guidance for kids is that \"private areas\" are areas that are covered by a swimsuit\\], then do you REALLY trust them?",

Of course, I understand how that can be concerning to a lot of adults -- because I understand how strange it could be if we were to hang out in real life. All we do is text, sometimes voice call, and play Minecraft with some of my other internet friends.   \n\n\nWe met over purely innocent interests, both enjoying Invader Zim, voice-acting, cartoons and video games. He has autism, so he doesn't understand the social standards (as she stated to me before) and oddness of us talking. Our relationship is purely innocent, just talking about Invader Zim, cartoons, theme songs and making Youtube videos.    \n\n\nI've had my fair share of pedophiles and their advances and know how to exit a conversation when it gets creepy or sexual. I know how to block and report them when things get messy, and even take it to the police if it involves harassment. It's just that I'm fairly sure my friend isn't one, especially since he liked my posts about being against MAPs (minor-attracted people) in the LGBT+ community. I'm just wondering if it's fair to just cut off the relationship because he's older than me? He really is a good friend and we have fun playing Minecraft innocently and he never discusses inappropriate topics with me nor I do with him.  \n\n\nIs our friendship okay and just an odd-ball? Or do you think it's fair for my parents to ban be from having internet friends because this one is much older? I'd like some advice, thank you.",

The doctors office was running late and when I came in a mother and her son seemed to have been waiting for a while. \n\nRather than complain or stay on her phone, I heard the mother read four short books like green eggs and ham to her son. They were laughing and he was super engaged. Never heard a peep out of him beyond trying to sound out words with encouragement from his mother.\n\nI'm always on the fence about leaning over and saying \"Hey just wanted to let you know, you seem like an awesome.parent with a great kid\". Mostly at th risk of seeming like a creeper. \n\nI did say it one time to a couple at a restaurant with a toddler. The mother nearly teared up and said that meant a lot to her. But i know it could come off differently to different people.\n\nSo parents of Reddit. If I see you bring a genujnely awesome parent or your kid being extremely well behaved - would you want to know and what's the least awkward way of letting you know?",

I know lots of people have babies close in age. Any advice about how to survive pregnancy with a toddler? Or how to prepare my son for another baby?",

For the past week, a family friend (her parents know him from the boy scouts, he's 19 and doesn't have a job) has been coming over to help out with the baby so we can get housework done and it's been great. BUT when he plays with our daughter, it's a bit too \"hands-on\" than we'd like. Tickling, her climbing on him, etc. Well currently, he's asleep, napping with her on the guest bed and he's spooning her.\n\nI absolutely feel the need to say something, but I don't want to be accusatory, because as far as we know, he hasn't done anything to her, and he's been a huge help around the house. I just need a polite, civil way to express that he needs to keep a bit more of a distance because he's making us uncomfortable.",

The younger two however tantrum multiple times an hour, and so far I have not been able to get a positive response. Example: 4yo hits a sibling, and gets timeout. 4yo refuses to comply with timeout. Nothing I say has any effect. I am reduced to holding the 4yo in time out with and having to deal with either struggling to get away and/or screaming. This lasts between 15-20 minutes, then the 4yo complys with timeout (5 minutes). Is there something I can say that works, or is there a better approach? Several times through out the day, we talk with them about making good choices and how bad choices (like hitting) have consequences.

And if there\u2019s any items that you found to have more than one function &amp; in turn cut down on clutter &amp; costs, etc etc, that could be helpful, also. s\nAnyway you wanna do it: short lists are fine, long lists are fine, lists of essentials would be wonderful..

Our daughter is smart, and she's always been a good kid, but since she's turned three, it's just been a downhill battle of trying to get her to listen to  anything. We have done the 'give them something ELSE to do' rather than always tell them 'don't do this' but there are just some situations when You can't positively redirect and it would be nice if she listens.\n\nLiterally, if you tell her not to do something, she'll look you in the eyes and do it anyway. I don't know how to deal with this. I've tried keeping my cool, I've tried yelling, we do timeouts, we take toys away, we explain WHY these consequences are happening, have her repeat it, explain how we can behave and avoid these problems, and yet every day just feels like a slog. I'm starting to resent her even though I love her with my whole heart, and I find myself checking out from interacting with her, because I'm busting my butt to try to keep positive activities and she's just ruining them after multiple discussions and warnings.",

I have multiple disabilities including a severe visual impairment and high functioning autism. I\u2019m applying for the more mainstream internships available before trying the schemes set up specifically for people with disabilities, so disclosing them is optional. Nothing wrong with disability schemes, I just think I can handle mainstream job opportunities.\n\nI live at home with family, so my mum and stepdad have been helping me with the job stuff (I\u2019ve applied to schools before but not jobs). While discussing my most recent CV she got annoyed that I haven\u2019t disclosed my autism (I disclosed the visual impairment). She thinks people should know that I have that difficulty. Meanwhile I think it will just drag me down, even despite the laws in place. I just don\u2019t want to feel singled out when getting on the job support.\n\nI really care about my parent\u2019s advice and guidance because I\u2019m not ready to trust my own judgements yet. But I don\u2019t want to be at a disadvantage because of my mum making my autism obvious. If I really had to mention it, I\u2019d let an employer know after I get the job.",

She was going to meet friends, but you arrived 2 hours early. You told her you wanted to check the prices in a particular store. She elects to  stay behind and use her cell phone.  You are gone for just under 15 minutes. When you return to the vehicle, she is not there.  You text her, but get no response.

            "selftext": "I\u2019m currently battling the working mom vs. stay at home mom debate, and need some advice. I returned to work full time when my son was nine months old. He\u2019s 20 months old now, and, so far, so good. I\u2019m due with my second child right when my older son will turn two, and I\u2019ll return to work when she is two and a half months old. \n\nI keep reading studies about how working moms are detrimental to childhood development and how kids of working moms are more likely to be depressed, anxious, have ADHD, and other things. But, I don\u2019t know if I buy that, and here\u2019s why: my mom returned to work full time when I was 11 months old and I am happily married, very successful career-wise and educationally, and overall very happy and feeling good about where I am in life. But these studies are making me paranoid... am I a bad mom to leave my children in childcare while I pursue a career? I work a condensed schedule (four ten hour days so that I get three days off a week), and while I miss my son sometimes, I feel as though he has a blast a daycare, and I get plenty of quality time with him in the evenings, on weekends, and during vacations and holidays.\n\nI don\u2019t feel like I was negatively effected by my mother working, and in fact, I feel like I may have thrived so much BECAUSE she worked. \n\nIf I quit my job, my husband and I will have to change our lifestyle DRASTICALLY, and neither of us are sure we want to live that way. Plus I\u2019d be passing up career advancement, promotions, retirement, and other longer term, bigger picture things. I feel like overall, I can provide for my children better if I work, while still getting plenty of quality time with them, despite not having huge quantities of time with them. \n\nSo here\u2019s my question: did your mother work when you were a child? If so, how old were you when she returned to work, how many hours did she work, and how did you turn out overall? (Emotionally, educationally, financially, and overall lifetime happiness and success?) \n\nEdit to add: how close are you with your mother now? I\u2019m VERY close with mine. I hang out with her weekly, and text/call her almost daily.",

She refuses pedipops/pedialyte, hates juice, I\u2019ve tried syringing milk into her mouth with horrible results since she hates the syringe.

She\u2019s still hydrated and has wet diapers and many, many real tears. Will she eventually just hit a point where she will drink something? I\u2019m at a loss and have no clue what to do. Help!",

When he dislikes something it is very hard to calm him down, especially bevause I can't just pick him up and carry him around. At least I can sing to him, but I think most lullabies are pretty boring, I'd like to sing something we can both enjoy. For example - I sing blind guardians bards song, so he can have adventurous dreams, he loves it. \n\nWhat are \"uncommon\" lullabies or slow songs you sing for your baby?",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone, I'm not sure if this is the right place to be... But I really hope so. This is long, so if you want the TL DR... Scroll down I am a mom to a beautiful 5 year old boy. He has not started school yet, but he has been in pre-k for the past year and some months. This is a very nice Christian pre-K and we've been fortunate enough to meet so many great parents with their boys. Recently my son has been going on play dates with a little boy that we will call Tommy. I'm not sure if this is the source of where this is coming from, but I want to check all angles before I throw any accusations at anybody. So several times Tommy has come to our house, and my little boy has gone over to Tommy's. I prefer for Tommy to come to my house, only because at Tommy's House his mom just had a new baby, and I know it might be hard on her to have two rambunctious boys running around. About a month ago, my son came home from Tommy's and that night he said something very strange to me, he said mommy can I suck and play with your boobies? I was stunned, I for one didn't even know he knew that that's what they were called, and I said to him no , you are not allowed to do that you have not done that since you were a little baby. I I thought it was strange, but I brushed it off because I know Tommy's mom just had a baby and I thought maybe he had seen her breastfeeding. \n\nTwo weeks later, me and my son went over to Tommy's house because I was meeting with his mom about something we're doing at the school. My son and Tommy ran upstairs to play, on the ride home my son told me that he and Tommy had watched a YouTube video on Tommy's iPad of naked girls dancing and he said it was really silly I didn't over react in this moment, because I could hear the Innocents in my son's voice that he really didn't know or think anything of it, but I did tell Tommy's mom because I consider her a friend of mine. She told me she would check his iPad settings and ensure that he wasn't able to access any dirty videos on YouTube. I didn't even know there were dirty videos like that on YouTube. So I didn't really make a big deal out of that. \n\n\nFast forward to last night, my son went over to Tommy's house for an overnight play date. Now normally I'm a little weird about letting him go places overnight, and this was actually the first time he has been to a friend's house overnight. But it was Tommy's birthday and they had went to Chuck-E-Cheeses and a couple other boys from pre-k we're over there as well. Last night when I was giving my son a bath, all of the sudden he started you know, masturbating... I feel weird saying the word jack off in regards to my 5 year old son. But that's what he was doing. With me right there, I felt bad but I yelled at him and told him to stop! And pulled his hand away, and he started crying. I noticed that his penis was very raw like he had been doing it a lot. I asked him what he was doing, and he said Mommy I'm sorry I didn't know it was bad. And it took me back to when he was three, and he was humping things, and I asked his pediatrician and the pediatrician told me that it was normal and not treat it like it was something bad he was doing and just to tell him to do it in private. \nSo\n, I asked him, is this something that you just recently learned how to do? Because part of me was thinking it's natural, and then the other part of me was thinking there is no way a five-year-old knows what this is... So then he tells me that Tommy taught him how to do it and that him and the other boys had stayed up all last night doing it in his bedroom in their tent ( Tommy's mom set up a tent in his bedroom as if they were camping out but inside)\u00a0doing it together. My son did it again three more times last night, that I saw. And when I went into his room this morning to get him dressed, he pointed at his penis and said it was hurting really bad. I pulled his pants down and it was almost purple. I told him he can't do it anymore because it's hurting him and gave him the speech that the pediatrician told me to give when he was three about how I know it feels good, but it's something that he can't do a lot and that you must do in private and to never do it at school. I'm assuming he stayed up a lot in the night doing it, which worries me. Because in my opinion he shouldn't even know how to do this.\n\n\u00a0 So, I guess my question is... Should I tell Tommy's mom? Is Tommy a bad influence on my son? Is it normal for a five-year-old to know how to do that,  but in my mind I'm just thinking that there's no way a five-year-old knows how to do this and I just want to make sure that nothing more is going on at Tommy's house. How do I approach this?\u00a0 There's no way\u00a0 it can be good for him to be doing it this much, because like I said his penis was very raw and skin was almost peeling off. I want to be able to tell him in a way that he understands that I know it feels good but it's unhealthy for him to do it so much.  How do I say this to him?  I grew up with all sisters, my son's father is not in his life, so this is totally new to me. I don't know what's normal for little boys to do, because I've never been around little boys until my son. I am with a new man now that I've been married to for 2 years, and I talked to him about this, and he said that he did not start masturbating until he was about 11 and he said that he felt it wasn't normal for a 5 year old to do it or know what it is, but that's just one man's opinion, and I know there are many others that I want to hear. So that's why I'm coming here for help. I don't want to overreact and call Tommy's mom if this is something normal. Also, I did call the pediatrician and schedule an appointment to talk with him on Friday. But I know my son is probably going to keep doing this oh, and I need to tell him in a way that he will stop doing it so much.\n\n\nTLDR: my five-year-old son first saw a dirty video at his friends house, and now he says his friend has taught him how to masturbate and that he did it with him. My son started doing it in front of me last night. Should I say something to the boy's mom? Or is this normal five year old boy Behavior? Now he is doing it a lot and his penis is very raw and I want to approach him in the right way.\n\n\n\n\nSorry if there are grammar errors, I have a broken hand so I have to talk to text. Thank you all in advance for answers, help, and any suggestions.",

Doing the math, it still makes more sense for both of us to continue working instead of having someone stay home. We make almost exactly the same amount.

All my friends have really good gaming consoles and all I have is a shitty gaming laptop back from 2013 which runs modern titles at 5 FPS. 5 F*KIN FPS. I just don't get it , I'm a smart kid and know how to balance my time well but no all they want is for me to sit all day and study. They literally lost their shit when they found me smoking pot last year. I need to detress from all the pressure but they dont believe in this. I'm going to be so f*cking happy once I get to uni and they cant do jack shit about my life.",

She just grabs stuff, sometimes without even looking at it or registering what it is, and off it goes. It can be her favourite food but some of it will end up gone. She just systematically clears her plate, and very little is actually getting down her gullet. I don't give her any other food to compensate afterwards, except the normal snacks a few hours later. I make sure not to react to this behaviour at all. Any advice please? Will she just grow out of it?",

            "selftext": "My wife and  I are in a high conflict divorce fighting over custody over 3 boys (ages 3, 3 and 2). My wife has pulled every Lifetime special in the book: restraining order with false allegations, drug abuse, domestic violence, violation of restraining order, contempt of court. I'm a Professor at a local university and been so for 15 years. I have possession charges from 20 years ago but i turned my life around.  I was a loving and supportive father. I miss my kids, they miss me. Now I'm paying $2000 a month (which i wouldn't mind if it was being used correctly) in child support for kids I have a few hours a week supervised timesharing with. If I mentioned everything that has happened since this divorce began it would take pages, would make you think I am writing you from some third world country, and would put a jerry springer episode to shame. But in summary: most every stunt the wife has pulled HAS caused me to lose my shit during this divorce and act out, I won't deny that;  I've cursed her out on multiple occasions and the judge knows I have. Our judge comes off to me as a no nonsense but very kindhearted, fair and intelligent man. I don't think my case is hopeless even after all my unruly responses to my wife alienating me from our kids. I'm currently homeless, and isolated, and it's quite painful and made worse when the court just enables her. Anyways, to a point eventually..... The most recent stunt she pulled is moving in her boyfriend. This guy is a convicted felon (breaking and entering  and spousal abuse charges, long time ago) whom i found out did the same exact thing my wife is doing to me, to HIS EX-WIFE. Also, he threatened a couple weeks ago to get an injunction against me for his daughter, his daughter  is someone whom I never met or knew existed up until the point I learned about this. His ex wife (we've started talking a little bit) apparently intervened and didn't allow him to do it ( he wanted her to sign off on it too).  I know it was my wife pushing this guy to do this. She's not a dumb woman, shes motivated, disciplined, methodical and cruel. She loves those kids, but will hurt anyone including them, to get what she wants. I know her well enough to know that.  She now has someone in her corner who can corroborate any lie or story she wants to tell about me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe judge ordered my wife to allow face-time contact once a day with the kids. It's been more like once a week is how often she actually answers or does it, and she makes it so miserable, she makes the kids look like their in a firing squad or being interrogated. She rarely has her face in view, when she does she is scowling and acts angry. She set a new bar yesterday though. Now I'm not exaggerating here: every day, every single contact for the past 10 months I have had to bear with her, she uses as an opportunity to get one over on me. Since yesterday I haven't slept, eaten. I'm still shaking in rage, and I don't know what the fuck to do.  She is going to put me in the nut house most definitely. Yesterday she face-timed me for the first time in a week, and what pops up on the screen is her boyfriend sitting in the bathtub, with my kids. Boyfriend is shirt off, pasty white. For first time in my life I felt physical nausea and faint from witnessing a 'social  situation' to put some perspective on it- I literally urinated myself and then threw up and threw the phone against the windshield of my car.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe mom was interacting with the kids and talking to them \"say hi to daddy\" like i'm hallucinating a grown man sitting there in the tub with my 3 naked boys. This is the first time I've ever laid eyes on this fucking cunt, and that's how my wife introduces me, after 3 months apparently living there.  How the fuck should I respond to this?  I've determined that sawing his and her heads off and throwing them on the courthouse steps in the middle of the night, is probably not the best path to get my children back.  What the fuck should I do here?  I don't want to piss off this judge anymore than I already have. I don't want him to think I'm making false allegations cause the wife will obviously deny this ever happened. I don't want to get an injunction against this guy cause he will be retaliating the rest of my miserable life.  And no i would not saw off anyone head. just a joke. I am at a point though where i would be ok with child protective services taking these kids, What she is doing i completely consider abuse. But although I feel like that I'm guessing  CPS will disagree.  I'm angry and upset. Do I not have a right to be? Please refrain from recommending i get a lawyer, I've had 4 of them over the past 10 months and that is a whole another universe of frustration I do want to even touch on right now. For the short term at least I am representing myself.  But any advice or false hope would be appreciated. I would post pictures of my kids here. they're so cute and such good guys I know it would have people rallying against this, but we all know I wouldn't do that to them. thanks in advance for any advice.",

I\u2019ve had a couple of instances where there were unattended older kids, 8-12, playing nearby, and the kids said or did something super mean to my baby. Once it was a lone boy maybe 8 or 9, following us around literally calling my then 10 month old a \u201cpuny weak little baby.\u201d I asked him to leave, apparently I can\u2019t tell him what to do so we left. My son cried and cried, but without the kid\u2019s parent around I honestly didn\u2019t know what to do. That was the first time. \nThe second time, a group of siblings came up on the equipment we were playing on and ran into him, knocked him down. I picked him up, told the kids what they did and to watch where they were going, then they did it twice more. They never listened to a word I said, and it made me too mad to stay. I thought it would be better to leave than really lose my cool on some stranger\u2019s kids. \nSo when talking to the parent isn\u2019t an option, how do you handle these kinds of situations?",

I, on the other hand, almost certainly do not want them.\n\n\nIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t enjoy spending time with them, and close friends/relatives with kids have complemented me on how good I am with them. This made me reconsider \u2013 albeit briefly \u2013 the idea of wanting one of my own.\nHowever, the way other parents and grandparents speak about the activity of child rearing, the less interested I am in the idea. One second it\u2019s \u201cthey\u2019re the greatest thing to happen to me!\u201d, but then quickly transition to something like\n\u2022\t\u201cWelp, I hope you enjoyed your hobbies and interests, because now you\u2019ll never do them again!\u201d\n\u2022\t\u201cHaha, good luck being sleep deprived for two decades!\u201d\n\u2022\t\u201cYep, your life as you know it is over, it\u2019s basically your child\u2019s life!\u201d\n\u2022\t\u201cOh man, enjoy not having money or free time or any sense of peace!\u201d\n\u2026And then immediately go back to \u201coh but you\u2019ll love it!\u201d Like wtf. Is it weird that I find this completely unappealing? I enjoy my hobbies, specifically running, animation and illustration. Giving that up is off the table. Whiny kids annoy the hell out of me. I *can not* function on sleep deprivation. Anything less than 7 hours over an extended period of time and I risk walking into traffic.  It seems like\u2026 all negatives and no positives.\n\n\n\nAm I just not cut out for kids? The way (usually older people) talk about it sounds like a neverending hellscape of torture and personal unfulfillment, and financial ruin. Or is it still possible to maintain an physically and artistically active lifestyle with children?",

            "selftext": "Hey guys I just wanted to see if anyone could give me some advice or tips if they\u2019ve gone through this themselves. My son (4 y/o) has always been somewhat of a picky eater. When he was a baby (0-2 y/o) he\u2019d eat pretty much everything. As he got older he started getting very picky and now he loves plain food ex. Plain rice, vegetables, salads, bread, nuts, the occasional chicken nugget or hamburger. But it\u2019s now gotten to where he flat out refuses to eat just about anything and if he does eat, it\u2019s like a few bites or spoonfuls and then he\u2019s finished. I couldn\u2019t tell you the last time he ate a full meal. I\u2019ve been told to not force it, give him whatever he wants regardless of nutritional value and whenever he wants. Has anyone else gone through a \u201chunger strike\u201d phase with their child? He\u2019s not malnourished or anything, his doctor says he\u2019s still at a good weight for his age. He runs and plays just like and as much as any other kid, it\u2019s just once he\u2019s done and his body realizes it has no energy, he crashes and the tears and yelling start haha.",

            "selftext": "Hi All. I had a question regarding my son that I was hoping to get some feedback on. It's not something that really bothers me or that I'm overly concerned about, but I was looking to get some opinions or experiences from other parents.\n\nI'm the father of a 13 year old boy (he'll be 14 next month). He's the youngest of my three and is currently finishing up 7th grade. I also have two older daughters (one about to graduate from high school and another in college).\n\nOne thing I notice about my son is that he still sleeps every night with the stuffed animals he had since he was little. He has about 15 or so that he keeps on his bed. In recent years, he'll put them away in the closet when he has friends or his cousins over, but they always end up back on his bed shortly after they leave.\n\nNow to be clear, I have absolutely no problem with him sleeping with stuffed animals and I'm not going to tell him he can't. I don't think he needs to toughen up or \"be a man\" and get rid of them or any of that nonsense.\n\nWhat I was wondering is if there may be a reason he is relying on stuffed animals for comfort at (almost) 14. Like I said, I have no problem with it, but I think back and can't picture myself doing that at his age and is wasn't something I noticed with my daughters at that age.\n\nAll in all, my son is a really sweet and pretty well adjusted kid. He's consistently been an A &amp; B student, he's a fantastic wrestler (and has placed high in some very competitive tournaments) and he has a great group of core friends (who I actually like very much). He doesn't tend to act overly childish for attention and seems to be developing and taking on responsibilities in line with his peers and what you would expect for a child his age. I don't really see any areas where he is struggling (outside the usual trials and tribulations of growing up).\n\nI just wonder if there could be an underlying emotional reason for the stuffed animals that maybe my wife and I can help address. Or maybe I'm just overthinking it and looking for something that isn't there. Really, to be honest, for all I know this could be a relatively common thing for kids his age and he just wants to hold on to that piece of his childhood a little longer.\n\nI was wondering if any other parents have had experiences with something similar. If so, was it something you discussed with your kid or was it something you left alone and let resolve itself over time? If you did talk to them about it, was there any underlying reason you found and could help address or just something harmless they found comforting. Thanks!",

Literally like \u201cI\u2019m so sick of my friends talking to me when I\u2019m trying to bitch about my problems constantly\u201d \n\nThere is an anxiety diagnosis but this is over the top. The kid won\u2019t do any chores, go to school, or even get out of bed half the time. When I try to discuss it, it\u2019s just a whole bunch of screaming and laying blame on others...and everything everyone does is wrong and there is ALWAYS a stupid excuse. \n\n\u201cI can\u2019t ride my bike to school because the seat is uncomfortable\u201d We bought a $40 seat and then the brake didn\u2019t work. Fixed the brake and then the \u201cweather wasn\u2019t good enough\u201d Bought a bus pass and then the \u201cbus never comes on time\u201d...and so on. \n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t go to class because the teacher is going to scream at me for not doing my assignment\u201d (Had a meeting with the vice principal and teacher, as usual everything was made up and blown out of proportion. Teacher provided evidence that she hadn\u2019t \u201cwritten mean things on assignments\u201d \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re mentally abusing me! All you do is treat me like shit! You hate me! You think I\u2019m stupid!\u201d (Etc...in response to \u201cokay, let\u2019s sit down and take a look at your report card. Maybe there\u2019s something we can do to bring this grade up. It starts like this and the namecalling and threats follow. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a stupid (screams long string of expletives) If you don\u2019t get out of here I\u2019m going to call the police and tell them you\u2019re abusing me!!!\u201d (I asked how I am abusing anyone, the answer was \u201cyou\u2019re mentally abusing me by  refusing to leave! I\u2019m not suicidal I only said I wished I had died!!!\u201d.... abuse. I do not think the child knows what this word means. Apparently the new definition of abuse is \u201canything you do in an attempt to help someone succeed\u201d \n\n\u201cI wish I was dead!\u201d \n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather live on the streets than live here with YOU!\u201d \n\nIs this normal? Again, I am aware this kid needs serious help but medication and treatment have been refused; doctors say they can\u2019t force anyone to do anything. I\u2019m about this close to losing my job because of all the time I spend managing this person who was sane very recently. \n\nAnd trust me, the kid\u2019s assessment of my personality is innaccurate unless every teacher, friend, and human being on earth is similarly evil and we are all out to ruin lives. \n\nThis is night and day from the person I know. Drugs aren\u2019t involved. There has been no abuse (I asked). We went through a period of bullying where a lot of kids hated mine but....given this behaviour it\u2019s pretty obvious why. The kid didn\u2019t seem to understand that constantly antagonizing people and making rude, insulting comments doesn\u2019t make them want to be your instant best friend. \n\nA friend of mine offered a job where the only requirement was to show up and this kid was put on a no-hire list for being, quote \u201cthe most miserable thing\u201d the manager had ever seen. \n\nWhat do you do when your kid says \u201ceveryone hates me!\u201d And it\u2019s pretty accurate...to be honest. I feel like this kid WANTS to be hated because you can\u2019t treat people so poorly and have them like you. Even as parents who were very recently raising a very sweet, well behaved child who loved helping out around the house and loved school, we don\u2019t want to be in a room with the constant bitching, demanding, and blaming.",

This is the first year she\u2019s been interested in girly stuff like makeup and dresses, after going through a nothing-but-jeans phase for the last few years. \n\nLast weekend I took her dress shopping at the mall. Crazy day, lots of girls shopping for prom, we were there for six hours. So much that\u2019s available is way too revealing or inappropriate. We finally found something that fits both her and the budget. It\u2019s pretty similar to things I\u2019ve seen girls wear in past years. \n\nHowever!  When her dad/my husband saw it he flipped out and said it was too short, too revealing, and much too old for her. He said with hair and makeup she\u2019ll look 30 years old. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that bad at all, but maybe I got jaded after shopping for so long. [The Dress](https://www.dillards.com/p/xtraordinary-caviar-bodice-double-hem-\ndress/509107486)\n\nFor reference, she\u2019s about 5\u20193\u201d and the dress hits her about 4 inches above the knee.",

I spend roughly $100 thee or four times a year on school and sports/activity pictures. If not more. I feel like every time I turn around there is another school or team picture. Obviously I want my child's pictures BUT I am content purchasing the smallest package or the digital package which is often cheaper because I'm just going to put it on Facebook and be done anyway. However; our family acts like starving vultures when picture time comes. I start getting texts from family members saying things like \"make sure we get a 5x7\" and \"when you get the pictures make sure to save us a few to give out\" and to be honest I'm at my wits end with it. I am spending a stupid amount of money just to appease family members. Is it wrong of me to think that I shouldn't have to pay the entire cost every single time? Like not once did I ever sign up to buy pictures every single time. Yet I get harassed for them. I have often asked my parents for help with them but my in-laws paid one time and acted like they owned all of the pictures and no one else could have any. It's just extremely annoying and I want other parents input. If I am wrong please tell me though. I want honest feedback. Thanks!",

            "selftext": "My wife and are are just a couple months away from having our first child. We are super excited, as is our families. This will be my parents first grandchild so they are ecstatic. Just a little background in our families... My wife and I are both children of divorce. Her parents tolerate each other. My parents hate each other. Nothing new there. All of them remarried so we have a HUGE family. I grew up living in my mom's house and she had always been overbearing. For that we don't really get along well. Now that we're having a baby she has been driving us crazy.\n\nMy mom gives us unsolicited parenting advice every time we talk or see her. I would say most parents give unwanted advice sometimes (which is fine) but with my mom it is all the time. She will ask us questions about how we're going to raise our baby and then tell us a better way to do it. She has critiqued my wife's decorating/layout of our baby room (my wife is an interior designer so my mom making comments on this is borderline disrespectful). She has ordered every \"What to expect...\" book ever written for us. She actually told me that she bought us a stroller, crib, changing table, and car seats because she wants to have Christmas at her house the first year. Like I said earlier, we are both children of divorce so somebody being pissed off at us for not going to see them during the holidays is nothing new so that's not really an issue for us. She's driving us crazy with the pregnancy and I know it will continue until after the birth. Both of my wife's parents are being very supportive and helpful. This is also true for my dad and step mom.\n\nThere's a few things that I know will happen once the baby is born:\n1. My mom will want to be the first one to hold her. If this doesn't happen she will throw a fit\n2. My wife and I have decided that after the baby is born and cleaned up we are not going to let our families in the room or see the baby until we get some alone time with our daughter. We told my mom this and she cannot understand why we would even want to do that. We have put our foot down on this and everybody else is very understanding. Like I said we have a huge family. She will want to be the first person in the room and see the baby\n3. She will expect us to do Christmas at her house this year since she bought us so much stuff\n4. She will be super angry if my dad spends more time with the baby. My dad lives about twenty blocks away from me and my mom lives half a state away so this one is bound to happen\n5. She will be mad because my brother and I both have two middle names and we only gave my daughter one. She will also be angry that the one middle name that we chose is my wife's mom's middle name and will throw a fit because I didn't want to do a second one with her middle name\n\nI know my mom really well and I can guarantee almost all of these things happen. She's a very petty person and never lets anything go. She's still mad at me for things I did in high school for some perspective.\n\nWe've tried talking to her but she just blows us off. Any advice on how to deal with my mom? She's driving us crazy.",

Yesterday our 16 month old son suffered a fractured leg at some point in the day while at his daycare. \n\nWhen I picked him up at the end of the day he was visibly upset and refused to walk or even stand. Our daycare provider said he had been upset for quite some time so I just picked him up and got him in the car. By the time I got home I could tell that something was seriously wrong and noticed was refusing to put any weight on his right leg. After a trip to the hospital we found out that he had a fractured tibia. We also noticed at the hospital he had several deep scratches on his back.\n\nThroughout the day his care provider made no attempt to contact us or even inform us of a possible incident and didn't mention anything to me when I picked him up. She also sent us \"update photos\" throughout the course of the day with him \"playing\". Looking at them knowing he had a fracture it is clear that he was in distress and was trying not to stand on his leg. \n\nWhen we confronted her about it she claimed she knew nothing about it and that he was walking fine all day.\n\nTo me this sounds like a case of serious neglect or possibly abuse, is this something I should report to CAS?",

I could give probably a hundred, if not more, examples of what I consider pretty questionable parenting decisions (non abusive) that i've seen over the years. Although i'm new and wouldn't really know where to post any of that. \n\nThrough my experiences I admittedly have some pretty strong opinions on what I do and do not want to do with my own children. Things like screen time, discipline, daily schedules etc. These opinions are not just from random interactions with children/ parents but from witnessing the effects that these things have had on the children i've spent 5-7 days a week with for years at a time. \n\nThat being said, I am about to finally become a parent myself. As strongly as I feel about these topics and as much hands on experience I think I have with handling them I question if dealing with my own child will change my opinions. I think any third party looking at what i've seen would agree that these parenting choices are questionable, but these people became these kinds of parents somehow right? ",

            "selftext": "So recently it\u2019s become mandatory in my country that 5 year olds learn about transgenerism. My daughter is 4 and not in school yet, but she should  be starting this year and I\u2019m thinking of possibly homeschooling her for a while instead. \n\nOf course she will find out trans people exist and I don\u2019t have a problem with trans people, but this is something I want to teach her about as the school might confuse her. \n\nWhen I was a little girl I was a massive Tomboy and  wanted to be a boy like my brothers. I never wore dresses, I played football and watched action movies. If I was living in todays world then i most  likely would have been labelled trans and put onto hormones etc. After going through puberty I started embracing my femininity more and today I\u2019m a very feminine woman. I feel like a lot changes in puberty.,,of course there are some people who will still feel they\u2019re the wrong gender when they go through puberty, and if my child felt that way then I\u2019d be willing to let them see someone, however I will never support 5 year olds knowing what they want, because I was that little girl once and children change so much throughout their life. \n\nMy daughter is also a bit of a tomboy, I teach her that she can dress, act, play with whatever she wants and it doesn\u2019t make her any less of a girl. I don\u2019t want her being taught differently and being made to feel like she has to fit the stereotypical definition of a girl..,\n\nA lot of people seem to be calling parents like me bigots but it\u2019s not that I hate trans people or anything, I just don\u2019t want my child to be confused at a very tender age. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of homeschooling her while she\u2019s young.

            "selftext": "Hi parental units!\n\nSo my son is turning 2 on the 7th but I\u2019m not throwing him a birthday party until the middle of May so I can utilize my parent\u2019s backyard space for his party when the weather is a bit nicer. Let me clarify a couple things in the title before I get into anymore detail, though. I mentioned I\u2019m in recovery (3 years sober on May 3rd) and that I am a single mom to emphasize my point of having a limited budget. Most parents try to save up before having children, unless it\u2019s unplanned, and even then most people still at least have a job when they get pregnant so can at least try to start saving at some point. For me, however, I got pregnant fresh out of treatment when I had virtually nothing, so it\u2019s been quite a process to rebuild my life while raising a child at the same time. As for the single mom part, that\u2019s self-explanatory. Usually two-income households are more often than not better off financially. My son\u2019s father is not involved in his life in any aspect, including financially, so it\u2019s just me. \n\nAll of these factors have meant having to cut quite a few corners and let go of experiencing many things that are now considered pretty typical when having children these days- for both me and my son. When I was pregnant I never did any maternity photo shoots, I didn\u2019t have newborn photos done and we\u2019ve never done holiday cards or had any sort of professional photos done. Our home isn\u2019t filled with the latest and greatest toys and technology  and the things he does have we keep and use until they\u2019re pretty worn out or he outgrows them. I didn\u2019t buy him shoes until he could start walking because I honestly saw no point in wasting the money on something he didn\u2019t really \u201cneed.\u201d He\u2019s never been to a birthday party because we\u2019ve never been able to afford buying gifts in the past (luckily things are different this year). The list goes on. Anyways, last year when he turned 1 I decided not to have a birthday party for him. I didn\u2019t even do a cake or anything because I figured it would be better to just save it for this year. I\u2019ve heard so many parents say that it\u2019s not a big deal because first birthday parties are more for the parents than the kid, but these are the same people who end up throwing some of the most extravagant parties I\u2019ve ever seen, so I feel like they\u2019re just saying it to make me feel better. Sure, I know he won\u2019t remember it. But it doesn\u2019t stop me from feeling guilty anyways. And since I don\u2019t plan to always be in this position and hope to have a career and get married and have another child one day, I don\u2019t want him being older and seeing me do things for his future siblings that I never did for him, to wonder why they deserve it but he didn\u2019t. Yes, I do realize that\u2019s probably irrational lol. \n\nSo here we are with his second birthday almost upon us and even though I\u2019m in a better place than I was a year ago, it\u2019s still nowhere close to where my goal is, so I can\u2019t do anything crazy for his birthday. But it\u2019s important to me that I do something to make him feel special, loved and important the day of his party. Yes, he\u2019s only two, but this kid is as intuitive as they come and I know he\u2019ll recognize being the center of attention and that this day is all for him. I\u2019m going to be saving money by throwing it at my parents so that\u2019s a plus, but I\u2019m a little lost on what to do for activities, food and favors. The guest list will mostly be family, my close friends and their children who are all pretty much his age. So about 5-6 kids and then maybe 15-20 adults? The theme is Thomas the Tank Engine (he\u2019s obsessed). I read an article somewhere that said bubbles were a good short activity for a group of toddlers/preschoolers but I\u2019m blanking on anything else. I also don\u2019t want to do a typical goodie bag filled with junk. If I\u2019m going to spend money on favors I\u2019d rather spend a little bit more and have it be like one small quality gift rather than a bag full of dollar store crap. So if anyone has any ideas for/how to save on the following, I\u2019d be super grateful:\n\n-party favors for the littles\n-decorations\n-food\n-activities\n-invites/thank you cards\n\nI don\u2019t mind getting creative and doing diy stuff as long as I don\u2019t have to draw or build anything haha. Thanks if you read all the way through this! \n\n",

All things we talked about NOT happening when I got hired but unfortunately there wasn\u2019t a contract. \n\n\nThere are a variety of other things (I\u2019ve bought groceries for them out of pocket when they run out of food etc)  and alas I found a new job. Unfortunately they want me to start ASAP and I negotiated to start next week. \n\n\nThis doesn\u2019t leave them much time to find new child care which I sincerely feel bad about because it\u2019s hard however I need to pay my bills and save money for the child that I will be having in 6 months. \n\n\n\nSo, I\u2019m not sure how to break the news to the family because I love the kids and have no relationship with the parents which makes the whole situation uncomfortable at best.

We came to the conclusion that we both are pretty excited for them and would like to have them sooner than later. We decided that we wanted to decide in the next 6-12 months on whether or not we are ready. \n\nI have a very stable job ( I am in the top level management of two small businesses and am about to buy out half of one of them.) So I feel that we are pretty financially stable. We're about to save $1-200 a week and tend to be pretty good at budgeting. Also I plan on getting a raise soon due to buying part of the company. If anyone could give me some idea of what kind of costs are related with having the baby in the sense of the hospital bills and such.\n\nMe and my fiancee are working towards being plastic free and cutting on our waste. We want this to translate for our child so we plan to cloth diaper, cut out unessential plastic items, try to mostly breast feed, etc. So if there is anyone here who has done this and could give some tips or how things went for you.\n\nAlso could you just give your opinion. Do you think we're too young(we've done a lot younger than normal so far), are there things you think I should be prepared for, how much should I save, and just everything you're thinking would be really appreciated.\n\n",

            "selftext": "I'll try to be concise because I have 2 exams next week.\n\nBackground on Me: 19F, college sophomore attending UC Berkeley. \n\nHow They Treated Me: They were great financial providers, but did a terrible job emotionally, IMO. I never went hungry and the rent was always paid. We don't owe any debt and they are paying most of my college tuition for me, though I hope to contribute 15k by the time I have graduated. I have made about 6.5k so far and get a generous scholarship. \n\nHowever, they put a ton of pressure on me to succeed academically (only A's are acceptable) and to get a high paying job after college (often reference their health problems, namely poor vision, and how I should support them or at least be able to support myself the minute after I graduate college). \n\nI feel like they were also emotionally neglectful and overly critical; although I am 19 and legally an adult in the US, I still wish I could be comforted/loved like a child and I feel that if they were more loving/expressive of it, I wouldn't feel this way as much. \n\nGrief Over My Brother: I was 11 and he was 7.5 when he was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer. After he died, they adopted a \"woe is me\" attitude and said that \"I'd better not give them any problems because they already went through so much shit with my brother.\" My parents also suspended a bunch of plans they used to have, like buying a house and doing anything fun in general as a family, so I was barred from that too. They also have put him on a pedestal and said that he will always be the #1 kid in their hearts unless if I cure his type of cancer.\n\nOverall, I am now severely mentally ill, struggle with suicidal thoughts on almost a daily basis, and see a therapist once a week, but they're financially guilt-tripping me into stopping seeing the therapist as well. \n\nI wanted to ask: \n\n1) Is my anger justified?\n\n2) How can I get over this?",

I'm just concerned for my son and was hoping this would be okay. I sincerely hope I'm not breaking any subreddit rules or laws.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/8w95KpC (I have a cheap phone camera and so the color is WAY off and the penis in real life looks much darker and purple)\n\nBackground:\n\nOur son has had issues in the past. His foreskin was too tight and had to be stretched as per doctor's orders (pulling skin back every diaper change), or he needed to be circumcised, and we opted to go with the stretching as circumcision was too expensive (our insurance doesn't cover it). It appeared red and \"raw\" at first, but as we kept stretching it, the foreskin was no longer too tight BUT it became colorless, purple, and dry. This was a gradual process, and I finally noticed that the color was off.\n\nAlso, I noticed that the foreskin when retracted, is red where the skin meets the glans (picture below). Maybe I'm being too paranoid and I am NO doctor whatsoever, but I was considering the possibility of the skin somehow constricting the blood, thus making the glans purple and the skin red?\n\nhttps://imgur.com/9LIDQHV\n\nI doubt this is an infection or virus of sorts. We give him regular baths and fully clean his diaper area, making sure to pull back and clean with baby soap. He also shows no symptoms of one (pain, fever...).\n\nPlease help me reddit. Again, I might be freaking out for no reason, but I can't go to the pediatrician either since it's a Saturday. I'll be here answering any questions and replies. Thank you.",

She was getting a little frustrated and out of nowhere, she turns to me, looks me in the eyes with a face of rage, and grabs and squeezes my private parts as hard as she could out of frustration and demands that it\u2019s her turn to win. \nShe knew what she was going for so this was no accident.\n\nI was a bit taken back and didn\u2019t know what to do. I sort of just explained to her that that sort of stuff is totally unacceptable and gave her a bit of a run down on what might happen if she did that to a stranger. \n\nIn my household, we\u2019re fairly comfortable with our bodies. Everybody has seen everybody naked plenty of times which I think is healthy. We\u2019re not exactly nudists but nobody cares if somebody\u2019s caught changing or whatever.

            "selftext": "Okay Mamas &amp; Papas, I have a problem. \n\nSo my oldest is 3 (will be 4 in July) and this has been his first year in MDO. \n\nA little back story, he is a little speech delayed. Didn't really start talking (other than animal sounds lol) until he was about 2, 2.5 ish. He would say a few words, but not the two or three word sentences you would expect from that age group. \n\nSo when we put him in MDO there were initially concerns from the teacher regarding his speech, mainly that he didn't speak AT ALL at school. (At this point he was much more vocal at home, just lacking some vocabulary and sentence structure. Which is half of why we put him in MDO in the first place). We explained the situation and our hopes that school would kind of bring him out of his shell, so to speak. \n\nAnd it did, beautifully. I have watched my son blossom and change more since August than I could have dreamed. He carries on conversations at home (perhaps still a little behind, but we have come leaps and bounds), does imaginative play, and even makes (attempts at) jokes! I have been so pleased with his progress; he completes complex tasks when requested, follows instructions better, etc. Basically his language in all aspects has skyrocketted. \n\nHowever, I had my first parent/teacher conference today with his teacher and she kept expressing the same concerns. Apparently, even though we have made substantial progress at home, he still doesn't appear to 'understand' whats going on at school. She kept using phrases like, \"He can't keep up with the conversation; he can't understand the instructions; can't, can't can't\" \"He has good days because we all care about him, but the other kids have to help him and often take guesses at what he wants/is doing\"\n\nI'm dumbfounded. She is describing a totally different kid than I see at home. Based on her concerns throughout the year, we have had him evaluated by both his pediatrician and speech therapy (doc says he is still a little behind, but is pleased with how much he is progressing no concerns for autism or anything like that; speech wants to see him further to help develop his language, which we are going to be doing). \n\nBut his teacher brings up some really good points, its great that he is doing so well at home, but its unusual that he hasn't progressed at school at all. She expressed concerns that she \"doesn't see him being ready for the 4 yr old class next year.\" \n\nHow can I help him if I'm seeing one kid at home and she is seeing something totally different at school? I'm so frustrated, I feel helpless and I don't know where to turn!\n\nSorry for the small novel!\n\nTL;DR  3 y.o has always been speech delayed, but progressed beautifully since starting school. Progressions are only seen at home, seems like a different kid at school and \"won't be ready for the 4 yr old class\" in the fall. ",

            "selftext": "I hate bringing my sons personal stuff on the internet but I\u2019m honestly completely lost right now and need some opinions/advice.  \n\nSome relevant background, my 13 yo son is autistic (he\u2019s not non-verbal).  The end of 2017 was the first time he ever dealt with death in any way when my dad, who was his only father figure, passed away.  This hit him hard and we\u2019ve been doing counseling to help.  The night of my dads funeral my oldest nephew, who is only 2 months younger than my son, introduced him to pornhub.  Now I fully recognize that he was and is at an age where he was getting curious, but the worst he had ever looked at was  half naked massages on YouTube.  Even then I didn\u2019t over react, just talked to him about being very careful online and what sites he went to (there were parental controls on his devices).  \n\nWhen my nephew introduced him to pornhub it became an addiction for him, and I mean that literally.  He started figuring out ways to bypass the parental controls, sneaking onto phones/tablets/computers that weren\u2019t his.  Stealing said devices and hiding them away in his room and spending hours upon hours watching porn.  Multiple nights he sat up all night on it.  His schooling suffered greatly.  He was following nude models on Instagram and had started lying.  \n\nFollowing the advice of his doctor and counselor we did the following approach.  He gets caught he\u2019s grounded for this long, gets caught again grounded again but now for longer than before.  He had a three strike rule that after the third grounding if he was caught again he lost that permanently.  He has now lost his phone, computer, tablet and Xbox.  The only thing he had left was tv.\n\nAll that said, he stole money out of my wallet last night.  So when he got home today asked him about, here\u2019s what happened.\n\nMe:  when we had to go to (local store) and get the grill lighter I had x amount of money in my wallet, I spent this much money and broke this bill to do it.  That left me with x, and I had x(these specific bills).  Now x (particular bill that I was given as change) is missing.  Why did you take money out of my wallet without asking?\n\nSon: I don\u2019t know\n\nMe: how much is left\n\nSon: none\n\nMe: ok, you\u2019re now grounded from the tv for two weeks. \n\nSon: wait that\u2019s a lie, I put it in my wallet and forgot to take my wallet to school.\n\nMe: ok, go get it and bring it back to me\n\nHe gets it and brings it back to me\n\nMe: ok, now you\u2019re still grounded for two weeks from the tv\n\nSo : (yelling and screaming at me) that\u2019s not fair, you can\u2019t do that to me, my friend died today so you can\u2019t do that to me\n\n(This is the first I had heard about this friend dying) I followed him to the living room\n\nMe: I\u2019m sorry about your friend and we can talk about that if you want to, but you intentionally stole money out of my wallet, and lied to me.  You still have to face the consequences of that action.\n\nHe proceeded to scream and cry and then shut down.\n\nI feel so lost here because he did wrong, and he has to learn his actions have consequences.  Even with the autism because he can\u2019t use it as an excuse all his life.  But I also know that being a spectrum kiddo that he processes and handles things completely different and I just don\u2019t know if I did the right thing, if I stick to it still or what to do.\n\nPlease help ",

            "selftext": "My oldest is in Kindergarten. We do Christmas as gifts that my husband and I work to give our kids, along with other family members. I never grew up with a belief in santa, but I was homeschooled when I was younger and never socialized with other until a little older aged. \n\nI have one friend with kids that are my kids age. We've known each other for 4 years. We live in the same neighborhood and do similar programs together. We also hang out on our own, like playdates and babysitting exchange. \n\nMy kid has grown up watching TV and movies most of his life (think Star Wars and Marvel films), and we've been fine with it. We also introduced video games this year, so he plays games like Plants VS Zombies. My friend's kids don't watch any tv. \n\nLast year, my friend came up to me and said \"[her son] just said that [my son] told him that Darth Vader was Luke's father\". I started to laugh, but then I saw that she was actually upset. She said \"his dad was going to let him watch Star Wars when he turned 6 as a special thing\". I was just kind of like \"Oh, sorry.\" But didn't say much else, because I'm very non confrontational, I was also shocked at what she was mad about. I read it as 1. You want me to control how our 5 year olds play and what they talk about?! 2. You want me to remind my son that he can't tell people a 40 year old spoiler?! I didn't know that my son would tell anyone that, but I also didn't think that it'd be such a big deal.\n\nThe next time I saw my friend, she said \"My husband is very upset about what [my son] told [her son], please don't let something like that happen again.\"\n\nNow, my son considered her son as one of his closest friends. I just told her okay, and didn't say anything to my kid, because I thought it was a ridiculous request, and the problem didn't come up again. \n\nWell, flash forward to today, we're having a playdate. I notice my son and her son whispering together, totally normal for them. Then I hear her son yell \"he is real!\" So I decided to step in to see if my son could fix his wording of what I suspected to be god or santa clause. \n\nI *have* talked to my son about the importance of letting people believe in what they want to believe, and not to bring that up unless they do [God and Santa]. Only because my husband and I are atheists who grew up in super religious homes, so we're constantly clashing with grandparents. \n\nI ask my son what the problem is. And sure enough her son says that my son is telling him that \"God and santa aren't real, but they are real!\" I gently remind my son what I've told him before, that it's not nice to talk about unless they bring up the conversation, and we let people believe what they want. \n\nHe may have been in the right, as he may not have started the conversation, but I just asked him to stop with this one. \n\nThe friend came up and asked what was going on, I told her and she was like \"Oh my gosh! My husband is going to be so mad about [my son] telling him Santa isn't real! He is going to be so mad! He is going to hold a grudge. He probably won't want them to hang out anymore.\" Then she repeated that \"he is going to be so mad\" and I just said \"I don't care\" in the nicest way I could manage. \n\nThe kids played a little while longer, but we didn't talk much after that. \n\nI feel weird. I didn't have any friends growing up, and I'm not sure how to handle a social situation like this. What would y'all recommend? What I would naturally do is just ignore the problem, pretentious it didn't happen, and hope it goes away.",

I am 28, I have been with my boyfriend for some time, and we talk about it a lot.

            "selftext": "This post might sound like a load of self pity. But it\u2019s not. It\u2019s just fact. And thank you to anyone who reads this. I have two adult children who tell me to fuck myself, they call me a bitch then my (single childless) adult son tells me he doesn\u2019t want anything to do with me, then he forgets what he said. Six months later he says Merry Christmas. I don\u2019t respond because he wants me out of his life, - so I take his word for it! Then of course his text response to me is that I\u2019m the worst mom ever. The daughter threatened me that I will be lonely in my old age. A presumptuous thing to say, that if she and her brother aren\u2019t in my life I will be lonely. As if no one else loves me. It\u2019s about money. And my time and my effort. If I don\u2019t do or say what they want, I\u2019m a bad mom., or \u201cmom of the year\u201d.  Like anyone, I certainly haven\u2019t been perfect, I was emotionally absent for a few years, but overall I\u2019ve done a LOT for them. Besides the fact they don\u2019t love me, their evaluation of me as a person is based on what I will or won\u2019t do for them. They will inherit a lot of money/assets. Not because they deserve it but simply because they manage money well. If I wanted I could give it all to my grandkids (daughters children). Anyway, I don\u2019t say much to them about that. The daughter is in touch with my accountant and corporate attorney. She talks to them, and tells me she wants to \u201cmake sure\u201d I don\u2019t give the assets to \u201cwhomever I am married to\u201d.  And I heard the word \u201cgravy train\u201d, my husband is riding the gravy train.  Legally, I have say over everything, good and well because I\u2019ve paid the personal price for this financially blessing. They haven\u2019t. Apparently right now she\u2019s in Hawaii with her kids. She sent me a photo last night saying I don\u2019t have to respond, just remember that I am absent. As though I am guilty for being absent. Right now the best I can do is nothing. I don\u2019t care. About any of them. I wish I\u2019d never had these kids. I\u2019m sorry to dump but I suppose I\u2019m reaching out to anyone who might relate to this. It\u2019s not just one of my adult kids, it\u2019s both of them, they play this thing off each other. \n\nI try to tell myself my life is about me and my husband and my dogs, because that\u2019s the truth. But I can\u2019t deny that this affects my psyche. How do I get past that? ",

My mom kept going on and on about how proud I made her. She encouraged me to post my pics on fb, which I did, and as was customary, included a few dedications to friends, family, and God. She later called me and I was surprised when she greeted me with a teary voice, saying she felt bad that I thanked her for \"giving clues on what and how to write\" compared to my dedix for my grandmother which was \"for inspiring me to write about the company you dedicated your life to\" and for putting my grandmother first. I meant no harm in doing this - everyone else thanked the company first and I thought nothing of it, but it skipped my mind that my mom reads a lot into fb posts and now I'm afraid she might get depressed over how I worded my post. :(\n\nI edited my post and kept messaging her about I didn't really mean it like how she thinks (that she's not that important, she's only second to my grandmother, that her help is so tiny in my eyes) but she's not accepting it in the end telling me \"go to sleep. You have other things you need to do tomorrow. I'm not important.\" and it broke my heart because OF COURSE YOU'RE IMPORTANT MOTHER STOP THINKING YOU'RE NOT. She's the one who's been there every step of the way, telling me she believes in me. \n\nHow can I make it up to her? I was thinking of buying her something (she likes flowers but I'm broke huhu. Maybe cake?) and making a love letter maybe? I thought of treating her out to a special meal but I can't go home this weekend yet due to hospital duties (I'm taking MD-MBA). If I make a special post about her on fb tomorrow, do you think it will be better? Or will she take it against me? Shout out to mothers out there, how would you like your kids to make it up to you when they fuck up? My mom and I often get into odds with each other over wording fb posts ugh I hate it I feel like I shouldn't have posted at all but I can't change the past.\n\ntl;dr: mom is sad and thinks I don't think she's important because I thanked my grandma before her in my MBA defense post. How can I make it up to her?\n\n[cross-posted from r/AsianParents] ",

Since we are really close and I am unable to have a baby, I really want to make this time as special as possible for her. I was thinking of putting together a basket with balloons to give her at the hospital. That way, even if she doesn't feel up to seeing me, I can still be able to support her indirrectly. \n\nSo I'm wondering, what would you have wanted to get from a friend when you were at the hospital giving birth to your baby? I have no clue what to give her, but thought it might be cool to put some fun/useful stuff in a basket for her instead of just giving her some balloons.\n\nAlso, is there anything you would have wanted a friend to do/not do when they are at the hospital? I want to show I care about her and not make the situation more difficult for her.\n\nI look forward to hearing your advice! :)\n",

            "selftext": "F[16]\n\nMy dad recently had a baby with his girlfriend who he\u2019s been seeing for a year. She\u2019s 28, (he\u2019s 40) and I didn\u2019t meet her before she was pregnant and I still don\u2019t really know her now, but that doesn\u2019t matter because she\u2019s here permanently and makes my father happy.\n\nMy parents divorced two years ago and I feel like it\u2019s my fault, and hate myself over it, if I stayed out of the way or was a better child, they\u2019d probably have wanted to stay. Anyways, that\u2019s in the past and I support their decision to move on, they deserve it.\n\nHowever, I feel like my house isn\u2019t my home anymore, and I hate being there, in the way of their perfect family. She\u2019s now living there with their baby and I feel like I\u2019m disrupting the environment, who wants to deal with the shy, introverted daughter of your boyfriend intruding all the time especially after just giving birth a couple of months ago. My room doesn\u2019t feel like my own either, but I stay in there most of the time to keep from being a nuisance, he doesn\u2019t really notice I\u2019m gone. \n\nI was an only child previously, but now I\u2019ve been replaced by his new baby girl and girlfriend, I feel worthless because I have no place but to constantly remind him of his past. He deserves a perfect family and an amazing child who isn\u2019t broken, depressed, and messed up like me. A lot of times I wish I could disappear so that he and my mom could finally be happy. \n\nMy mom is a great mother but she\u2019s with her boyfriend a lot and I\u2019m left alone, or she\u2019s always preoccupied with him or texting him, I don\u2019t blame her, she deserved to be loved. \n\nBut now I feel neither of my parents want to be around me, and I will never be enough to be loved or wanted. \n\nI feel replaced there as well, so essentially I have no one to go, which is why I\u2019m here. I\u2019m not special to anyone and no one really cares about me so I\u2019m very confused why they keep me around. \n\nMy dad adores his new daughter and wife and I feel like his past or a background character, I don\u2019t really have a family anymore. To be very honest, I\u2019m jealous of her, she has the perfect parents, the perfect family, the perfect house, and she is loved and adored. \n\nShe wasn\u2019t a mistake like I am, but I would never ever take it out on her, she is innocent. I don\u2019t like being around kids but she deserves a better person than me.\n\nI am no one\u2019s favorite anything. I feel thrown away, I know I can be biased but I really have tried my best to be a good child, I\u2019m never intentionally disrespectful and I\u2019m a straight A student even when my mental health gets terrible. \n\nMy dad calls me sometimes, and talks to me when I\u2019m around sometimes but not like he used to, I feel so bad for being alive. I never get his attention anymore (not that I deserve it and I should probably be more independent for my age.) \n\nI think my questions are how can my father love me and his new family? Also, how can I get my mother to see I feel ignored and dead inside without being disrespectful or making her feel guilty? Do you think they would be okay or care if I died?\n\nI don\u2019t want anyone to think I\u2019m a brat or being selfish, I truly want them to be happy but I\u2019m scared of losing them because after I do, I\u2019ll have nothing left (I have no friends, pathetic I know.)\n\nPlease help me with insight as a parent, I feel really bad for typing this, again, they\u2019re good people. \n\nThank you.

She also likes her downtime a lot too just watching netflix or listening to music.\n\nShe's very girly... clothes, jewelry, makeup, etc... but buying her more of that stuff doesn't seem like a special 18th bday present.\n\nShe's joining the Navy and going off to bootcamp when her senior year ends.\n\nShe's always been very artsy and creative, loves dance/music/books. but I'm not sure she's really too into that side of herself lately.\n\nSo maybe either some parents of a girl that age or some of you younger women who's 18th wasn't that many years ago could throw some ideas at me?",

I'm currently working to save up money for when I go to grad school in the fall, and I'm still living with my parents until then because it doesn't exactly make sense to sign a lease when I'll probably be moving to a new city in a few months for grad school. I'm very grateful that my parents are continuing to let me live with them for this period of time.\n\nThe thing is that I have a 10 pm curfew. I have never been in any kind of trouble, my idea of a \"night out\" is going over to a friend's house to hang out and grab a bite to eat. But this curfew is a major drag on my social life. I consistently have to cut the night short to run home to my parents to make sure I'm home in time. It's even hard for me to babysit for my friends with young children because of how early my curfew is. \n\nI guess my question is: how do I talk to my parents about this and hopefully get them to relax my curfew a bit? I'm not trying to stay out into the early hours of the morning, I just want to not feel so boxed in and terrified that some bad traffic on the way home is going to get me into trouble. ",

There\u2019s a fair number of people on this page, over 1000, and there were more than 100 comments on this post! Every single one was saying things like, \u201cduh,\u201d \u201cthis is a stupid question. You\u2019re a bad parent if you don\u2019t go through their phone,\u201d \u201cof course, I pay the bill, it\u2019s not their phone. It\u2019s mine.\u201d One lady said she gives her kids 30 seconds to give her their phone, and if they take longer, they\u2019re grounded because they\u2019re obviously hiding something. Many of them said they have spyware apps on their kids\u2019 phones. \n\nAnd like. I get those sentiments? But these women were talking about kids from the ages of 8-20. Twenty! Why would you want to go through your twenty-year-old\u2019s phone?? And why would your 8 year old have a smart phone?? \n\nOnly one woman said she wouldn\u2019t go through it without a definite reason, and all the other moms called her stupid and naive. Like 20+ comments against this poor woman sharing her opinion. Obviously I didn\u2019t comment. \n\nTo me, unless you have a concern for their safety and a reason to look....I feel that all you\u2019re doing is fostering a relationship without any trust. I mean, how better to teach your kids to hide things and lie to you than to completely undermine their trust? \n\nI wanted to know y\u2019all\u2019s opinions. My LO is 12 weeks old so it\u2019s not like I have to worry about it any time soon. My basic plan is to get a crappy flip phone or something from age 8/9-13/4, in case of emergencies and to keep DH and me in the loop. But after that, I feel that if I\u2019ve done my job as a parent, I should trust her enough to have a phone relatively freely. \n\nAll these women are also much older than me. I\u2019m 24. Am I just a stupid millennial? I\u2019m hoping I can get more sane opinions from y\u2019all. \n\nTL;DR How do you feel about going through your children\u2019s phones? Why? If pro, at what age do you think it\u2019s no longer appropriate to do so? ",

            "selftext": "Hello parents!\n\nThere is a sub here on Reddit r/Benzedrex. r/Benzedrex is a sub about abusing a kind of allergy inhaler called Benzedrex that is sold in all pharmacies. It is not kept behind the counter. It is not restricted, and anyone can buy it. They only cost a few dollars. And the active ingredient in these inhalers will get you high if you ingest it. The active ingredient is a stimulant, and when it is ingested it will make you feel like you have used methamphetamine or Adderall. I know this because my 12 year old son read about abusing these inhalers here on Reddit on r/Benzedrex and almost died. I am appalled that Reddit allows a sub like this knowing full well teens/tweens use Reddit. I made a post on r/Benzedrex which I have copy and pasted below for you to read. I am asking you to reach out to Reddit, and demand that this sub be removed. This sub tells you where to buy these inhalers, how to abuse them, everything a child needs to know to get high. Please, reach out to the Reddit admins and demand they remove such reckless information from their site. My post on r/Benzedrex follows. Thank you for your time.\n\nI have a 12 year old son, his name is Ryan. I received a phone call at work last week from Ryan's school. Ryan had a seizure, and they had called 911, he was being taken to the hospital. Ryan is completely healthy and never had a seizure before. I was terrified and raced to the hospital. Ryan had another grand mal seizure in the ambulance. His blood pressure was very high, and he was disoriented. The doctor asked Ryan if he had taken any drugs, and I was floored when he said yes, and said he had ingested \"Benzedrex\". They ran a drug test on him, and confirmed that he had Benzedrex in his system. That was the only drug that was in his system. They admitted him to the hospital. It took quite a bit of medication to get his blood pressure under control. He was given medication to stop the seizures. I was completely shocked and devastated. I asked Ryan how he knew about using Benzedrex, and he said he read about it here, on this sub. That he had used some of his allowance to buy two inhalers at the pharmacy that is down the street from our house, and had ingested one and a half of the inhalers before he went to school. He learned where to purchase it here. He learned how to dose it here. And he almost died. Ryan is out of the hospital and at home now, but he still is not quite right mentally. The doctors think that will improve. I pray they are right.\n\nI am shocked that Reddit allows this on their site. I don't understand why they do, considering the fact they know children/tweens/teenagers frequently use Reddit. I had no experience using Reddit prior to this and there subs on here for teenagers and for gamers, both things teens and tweens obviously will use. This is entirely irresponsible of them as a company. And I am disgusted that the \"moderators\" here allow and participate in this sub, knowing full well children can see this. Ryan said he read here that using Benzedrex is safe, and he believed it. Of course he did. He is 12. Now, as a parent I obviously need to step up my game more I guess. I have taken Ryan's phone away, and put parental controls on our computer. Ryan will no longer be getting a cash allowance. I will be monitoring him much closer, not that he was unsupervised before, but with information out there like this for any child to see, I apparently need to do more to keep my child safe, considering the moderators here could care less if a child does this stuff.\n\nI will be contacting the CEO of Reddit Steve Huffman about this, as well as all the people on Reddits board. I will be emailing every executive telling them I am appalled a sub like this is allowed to exist, and telling them about Ryan. I am going to make posts on the parenting subs about this sub, and to warn other parents, and implore them to contact Reddit and demand this sub be removed. This sub needs to be shut down. I also have an appointment with my attorney next week, to discuss bringing a law suit against Reddit, and also against the moderators here individually, since you are the ones actually allowing this to happen, and supplying information to children how to get high. Street drugs are expensive, and most 12 year olds would have no idea how to get them, or could afford them. Anyone can buy Benzederx, and it is cheap, and you are providing all of this information to any child who see's this sub. If I do not get the response I desire, I will start reaching out to the media, sharing Ryan's story with them. I'm sure other parent's will be outraged to know this sub exists. Shut this sub down now, before you hurt someone else's child.",

            "selftext": "Hi, so I posted this in another parent group but it got locked so I couldn't respond or get any further responses so I came here.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMy hubby and I have been married for just a little over a year. We moved from Ireland to England and have recently got new jobs which we are both excited about.\n\nI work as a nurse for the NHS and have a job with opportunity for progression and further university training.\nSo I'm pretty excited.\n\nWe've been talking about starting a family the tail end of this year. Which we are excited about.\n\nBoth our families are back in Ireland so we won't have them immediately for support should we need it; so for the most part we will be on our own. Which I'm a little nervous about but other people I'm sure have done it before. So we are willing to give it a go.\n\nMy hubby has said that after my maternity leave we should talk about what happens next. Who will look after the child?\nI had just assumed that (provided I still feel this way when all is said and done) I would just go back to work and that a child minder/nanny would look after the wee one.\nHubby has said that he would feel a bit weird about a child as young as (between) 6-12 months being under the care of a nanny. (All dependent on how much maternity leave I'm entitled to)\nI hadn't thought of it like that and it kinda freaked me out a little that this was an issue. (Obviously each to their own, no judgement intended here at all!)\n\nI can see his point, he felt concerned that the child would be practically raised by a nanny or day care.\nI said today that the child would only be with them for a matter of hours so although it might be (hypothetically) 3 days a week. The hours spent with the nanny might only be say 24 in total a week. (Hope that makes sense)\nHe seemed to be ok with this and set his mind at ease \nWe also would hope for family to come visit once a month or so. So this would be helpful.\n\nTLDR;\nSo my questions are, has any parents out there been in a similar situation where family are not readily available? Or have no family support? If so how did you manage? What advice would you give? What would you do differently? What obstacles did you face?\n\nThanks in advance, folks",

Stuff like.\n - no visitors in the first month (I've seen some suggest 6 months!) no exceptions\n -written proof of your vaccination history before you see the baby\n -when you do visit you better be bringing food or offering to help with something\n\netc etc.\n\nI'm British and had honestly never come across ANY of this during my pregnancy or afterwards, it's only in the last few months where I've been browsing family and parenting subreddits a bit more it's cropped up again and again.\n\nNOW, fair play, some of those sub reddits are 'JUSTNO' one so I'm prepared to accept the 'rules' might be less generic and more 'my mother is hipster asshat who will definitely invade my privacy and give my newborn herpes' but it's across enough other subs that it seem (at least some people) think this is just...normal? And what you do once you've given birth.\n\nLike I said - if it's what you want it's what you want and I mean you can set whatever limits on your own kid you want!\n\nI guess I just don't really get it? \n\nSome of it (if you visit clean my house etc) seems a little ....entitled? Like people should 'pay' you for the 'privilege' of seeing your kid? It seems a good way to alienate friends and your support network whilst falling into the group of 'i'm a mummy so i'm *special* group of people.\n\nSome of it (sickness/vaccination) seems a bit OTT I mean we kept obviously sick people at a distance (my uncle had pneumonia for instance and held off visiting) but I never remembering worrying about whether visitors could prove they were current on all jabs and were confident they didn't have a mild cold or something (my son is only 18 months so it's not like this was a different time!) Is this just a more American thing tied to the rise of anti vaxxers?\n\nAnd sequestering yourself away with a newborn for month honestly just sounds like hell! I was so bored in the those first few months I actually went and visited an old workplace I'd left about 5 year previous just to get out the house! \nI am fully aware you don't 'owe' anyone time with your child, but they are only that tiny tiny newborn fresh for such a sort space of time, I just remembering wanting everyone and their mother to see him before he got bigger XD \n\nSo I'm just wondering like is this something common in other countries? Was I wildly irresponsible and too laid back? XD Or am I just looking at a small but weirdly vocal group of very uptight people who think it's normal to have a baby then go into hiding?\n",

He had supervised visits for my daughter's first few months of life and then suddenly moved across the country for a \"new start\" when she was 4 months old. All in all he saw her maybe 5 times. He has since been incarcerated more times than I can count and has not changed his drug habits. \n\nMy husband and I got married two years ago and he was able to adopt my daughter at the same time. He has been there every step of the way, never really seeing her as anything but his own child. He is the most wonderful man and they love each other dearly. He also has a son from a previous relationship who has taken his role as big brother in stride, and we welcomed our youngest daughter to the world last year. \n\nI was close with BD's family when we were together and they expressed how much they wanted to still be in my daughter's life despite BD not being involved. Aside from a few members, they have never been anything but understanding and loving towards her. She has an uncle who is just a little older than her and they adore each other. \n\nThe issue is, her uncle is asking questions about how he is related to my daughter. His parents were able to give him an answer that satisfied him for now, but it wasn't the whole truth. We just worry something will slip and our daughter will find out from someone else that my husband isn't her bio dad. \n\nSo here is my question: How do I tell my kid? When do I tell her? I always thought we would just answer truthfully whenever she has questions, but now I'm not so sure it's in her best interest to wait. \n\nTldr: My husband has been around since I was pregnant but isn't my 4 year old's bio dad. Her bio father hasn't been involved since she was a few months old and my husband has since adopted her. Her 5 year old uncle is asking questions and we are worried he will tell her. Do we tell her now? How do we do it?",

Me, already feeling out of place since I can\u2019t drink or be around smoke, hid inside. Since staying up late is a challenging task for me (I am currently 8 weeks) me and my husband started to leave around 10. As we were leaving my friend drunkenly and loudly states \u201cWhen do we get to announce that you\u2019re pregnant?\u201d which his wife laughed and replied \u201cI think you just did\u201d. I was humiliated. This is my first pregnancy, and I am still in those early stages of wanting to make sure everything is going good and is healthy. Me and my husband got in the car and I start crying. How could my friend do this to me? Granted it was just a small number of people, it still hurt. I also don\u2019t think my drunk friend realized this at all. I am troubled with what to do or how to move forward. I feel kind of idiotic for letting it get to me so much, I am just not at the point where I am ready to be open about my pregnancy. I am really close to these people because my husband works away and is gone a lot, so they have \u2018adopted\u2019 me into their family. But I am at a loss on how to handle the situation. What are some stories you guys have about being outed before you\u2019re ready?\n\nTL;DR: Best friend drunkenly outed my pregnancy to a group of friends. I was humiliated. Can\u2019t decide if I should continue being shitty and avoid him and his wife or let it go. ",

I assumed his girlfriend was coming along but I just found out is just going to be him and our daughter. I\u2019m officially freaking out. \n\nI\u2019m planning to ask him if I can tag along.

I trust him but I\u2019m concerned that if something was to happen to him/them, my daughter wouldn\u2019t know what to do, especially being so far away from home.

            "selftext": "Hey Reddit Parents,\n\nI'm hoping for a bit of advice. My SO and I recently moved into a new apartment. We didn't need to move, and had a pretty good situation going, but this place seemed too good to pass up.\n\nThe community has quiet hours from 10pm to 8am. On our first evening in the apartment, the downstairs neighbor came upstairs to ask us whether we could please try to be quiet starting at 7, because that is when their 2 year old child goes to sleep. She told us which bedroom was the baby's (we both have 2bd/1br apartments, in what i expect are similar if not identical floorplans), and upon learning that the room we planned for our bedroom would be above the baby's room, we flipped the rooms around. At the time, it seemed like a great way to deal with the fact that we live above a baby, both for us and the baby. \n\nFast forward a week, and we get an email from the landlord that she has already complained repeatedly about thumping from our apartment. I'm guessing this is due to the fact that we have been moving in and haven't quite mastered levitation enough to get a couch or heavy box to where it needs to be without creating a thump. We email the landlord back to apologize for moving during the time of day when we are supposed to be movibg, and she agrees to pass that on/that it is reasonable to create noise when moving and we haven't done anything wrong. Seems fine for now, but keep in mind that in a community with quiet hours, noise complaints can become evictable offenses, so the fact that she seems to have little understanding of that is fairly concerning.\n\nNow, in the last two nights, we have been woken up five separate times by this two year old, between 3 and 6 am. Not in its room, but in its parents room, directly below ours. \n\nI get that babies cry. But we have already kind of structured our home around trying to be cool to the baby, and it feels like the neighbors downstairs both don't care and decided the second we moved in that they were going to be unreasonable towards us.\n\nIts been 10 days in this apartment, and we are already regretting it. Do we have any recourse here? Can we ask the parents to contain the crying to the kid's room at night rather than every room in the apartment? Or do we just adjust to the fact that our neighbors suck and hope the kid grows out of 4x nightly tantrums soon enough? When can we reasonably expect nightly tantrums to end if they haven't by age 2? Is there any way to get through to these parents, or are they just unreasonable people?",

I saw [this image](https://imgur.com/1Qe44EF) on Facebook today, and I really agree with it.\n\nThe way I was raised, I pretty much had unlimited screen time always. I had a TV and a computer in my room at my parents' house since I was 6 years old. Long story short, I now have a computer-related job and I feel I was better off for having all that screen time. Aside from gaining technological proficiency, I also was able to stay in the loop for pop culture. It doesn't sound like it's a big deal, but when you're a kid and you haven't seen the show or the video all the other kids are talking about, you feel pretty alienated.\n\nAnyway, I'm just asking this here to get more perspective on screen time limits. I agree with the photo I linked, in that we need to embrace technology and show kids how to set their own limits and be productive with the screen time they do have. What do y'all think?",

We live a modest yet comfortable lifestyle as did the generations of our families before us.  We aren\u2019t flashy, we eat well and like to travel but by no means do we live luxuriously.  \n\nMy son inherited at a young age a college fund and a sizable nest egg from a great grandparent in addition to oil and gas mineral assets that are currently generating him insane amounts of money.  We have wisely saved and invested every dime!  Literally we stil Save change and put it in his savings account and participate in U Promise.  The last year I worked he was 11.  I made $30,000 and he made $68,000 off of interest, royalties and leases.\n\nBy the age of 17- in 3 years he will have over a million dollars in savings and investments and still earning more.  I want him to continue to be the good student he is now and maintain motivation for success.  I want him grounded and as normal as possible!  He knows he has a college fund and has heard us speak some about his mineral interests and income but we have kept from him any dollar amount attached to it.  I don\u2019t want him to become an arrogant twit.\n\n  I can\u2019t really talk openly about this with anyone close to us because I don\u2019t want them to spill the beans or think of us or him any differently.  He is a good kid, handsome, modest, athletic, respectful, fun and has a good circle of friends in school, teams and church.  In this day of hyper consumerism and brand driving it could all blow in the wind with a few bad decisions on an overpriced hoodie, pair of sneakers and a ridiculous car!  That kind of windfall is tempting to even the best of us.\n\nI had student debt and worked my way through college, my husband joined the army to receive the GI Bill so he could attend college after service.  This is a situation we never dreamed we would face and it is a tremendous blessing.  Any advice on how or when to involve him in decision making and future planning.  It is an epic opportunity for him to achieve so many life goals.  Thank you for your honest opinion and advice. ",

I just have a few things in my mind regarding parenting I would like to get closure with \n\nHere are my questions:\n\nWhy do parents say 12 months instead of a year? And 24 months instead of 2 years? I get that when your child is this young you have to use months to mark important milestones in certain situations. But in casual conversation with childless people why don\u2019t you just say the child\u2019s age in years?\n\n\nWhat are your opinions on having sex while pregnant/with a toddler in the room? I personally find it repulsing but I would like to know an actual parents opinion. \n\n\nHow do you deal with favoritism? You say that you love all your children equally yet that can\u2019t be true in all cases. What do you do when you actually prefer a child over the other?\n\n\nDo you ever feel disappointed how your child has turned out? If so, why?\n\n\n\nThank you for taking the time to answer some of these. It means a lot (:",

Just before I start I would just like to say this is not a pro-childfree post, I'm not trying to convince anyone of anything, I just wanted a different insight on what parents think of us. \n\nFor some reference I am a childfree person, I never wanted kids for MANY reasons and never really understood why anyone would want them. I am of the mindset of live and let live; if you want a kid and can support it then go right ahead! Do what makes you happy, if you don't want a kid, same thing, go nuts! \n\nOne thing childfree people do stuggle with though is a lot of backlash, more than most people think. We get rediculed, questioned daily, and in even more serious cases get kicked out of our families, and get our birth control and condoms messed with because \"we'll change our minds once we have a kid!\" There is a dark underbelly and hatred towards us sometimes. If you want to know more then I'd reccomend going on the childfree subreddit, or reading some articles if you want.\n\nOverall I wanted some honest parent insight;\n\n1. What do you think of childfree people? \n2. What made you want to have a kid?\n3. Why do you think there is a stigma against simply not wanting to have a child? \n\nAgain, I'm not trying to start any arguments or debate anyone. I really am just curious about the parents mindset :) thank you!",

He hasn't been getting the greatest sleep since he started daycare 2 weeks ago and he got his first cold and ear infection (we're giving antibiotics). Even though his sleep has been poor, it has been enough for me to go into his room when he wakes up, rub his back, and just sleep beside the crib. Tonight was different, though. When I went in, he started screaming more and would not go back down. It wasn't even enough for my wife to breastfeed him. We checked and changed his diaper and measured his temperature and every was fine. It took my wife about 20 minutes to calm him down and now they're laying down together in his room.\n\nHas this sort of thing happened to anyone else here? I have no idea what caused this. I realize there's a lot of change in his life right now but he's never become inconsolable like this at night. Does anyone have any advice? Thanks in advance.",

We could then move the glider and changing table into the guest room/nursery when the kiddo was ready to migrate from bassinet to crib, and hopefully by that time be on a more reasonable sleep/feeding schedule overnight (knocks on wood).\n\nLast night husband says he's now not sure of this plan, because he's read that it's not good for the person who is working full time outside the home to also sleep in the room with the baby, since then neither person gets a restful night's sleep--and he has issues sleeping on mattresses other than our own because of his back (indicating maybe baby...and me? should sleep in the guest room from day one?).  For context, he has 2 weeks parental leave, and I have 4 months.  We talked about it a little bit, but I basically said we'd have to talk about it more and give the arrangement (whatever it is going to be) more thought--but that I definitely want a plan soon because not having an idea of what we're going to do gives me a lot of anxiety.  He isn't opposed to helping out and knows he won't get as much sleep as he's used to when baby comes (he mentioned something about 'shifts' whatever that means), I think he was just presenting what in his view is a logical problem to having the baby in the place where both parents sleep all the time.  \n\nHow do other people make baby/parent sleeping arrangements and share the overnight duties when one person is working--or, after I go back to work--two people are working?  The more I started thinking about it, I realized that if my reality becomes I am alone every night in a room with the baby taking care of them all night, while my husband is getting his 7-8 hours of shut eye in another room so he can go to work, I'm going to likely get very resentful VERY quickly...especially because it is not as if once he leaves for work I will be giving the baby to someone else to take the \"day shift\" and get to get a restful stretch of sleep then either.   I also don't love the idea of not sleeping in the same room as my husband for months on end-- but the inconvenience of having the baby in another room from where both of us sleep from the beginning (and lost of any guest space from day 1) is not lost on me either (and I've understood that it is recommended to have the baby in your room at the beginning anyway?)\n\nSince I'll also be going back to work after 4 months, I also don't want the set pattern to be that I am the only one who deals with the baby overnight at all times.  I plan to breastfeed, so I know that a some level feedings will often fall to me anyways (bottle feeding of breastmilk being a sometimes option?) but for those who have been down this road--what worked for you?  How did the working/non-breastfeeding partner meaningfully contribute to the newborn's care, overnight or otherwise?\n\ntl:dr- husband and I are unsure of best place for baby to sleep (in room with both or one of us?) and how to share feeding/changing/comforting duties when one or both of us is back at work--especially overnight--help!

The floor does not absorb noise at all.  \n We are pretty sure she is being neglectful in her parenting, but I don't want to take any action yet, in case we are just being unreasonable due to the lack of sleep this is causing us.\n\nThe big main issue is this. She is literally barricading him in his room with a baby gate and some kind of heavy furniture pulled across to stop him rattling the gate (this only started after we complained about him rattling the gate for 3 and a half house from 6.30AM to 10AM before she got out of bed)\nHe wakes between 5AM -6AM every single day, and immediately begins banging on the walls and furniture repeatedly and shouting for his mummy. At best she will shout \"shut up\" or at worst completely ignore him, and it goes on for hours unless we go and knock on her door or make a lot of noise above her bedroom. We have tried talking to her about this issue but she is in complete denial and claims he is \"just playing like any child would\". But we can hear everything and it is completely clear that he is only trying to get her attention. One noise he has discovered seems to be lifting and dropping some piece of furniture and we can FEEL every bang through the floor. But still she ignores it. He is spending 12-15 hours in his room every day without seeing his mother at all, and only hearing her voice when she tells him to shut up. \n\nOther things we have noticed. She only plays with him when she has visitors, the moment they leave, he panic cries and she tells him to shut up and threatens to put him to bed. We never hear him laughing when it just the two of them.\nWe have not heard her teaching him anything, congratulating him, or even just generally talking to him aside of to tell him off. Every time we walk past her window (ground floor) she is sat on her phone and he is sat quietly.\n\nWe are pretty certain she is treating him like a little burden and annoyance. We have tried speaking to her several times and at best she will get up when he starts banging for a day or two, then it all goes back to normal. \n\nHave you any suggestions as to how to approach the issue with her further? Or should we contact some kind of child protection service?",

            "selftext": "I got a new neighbor two months ago. I've only seen him and his kid and he hasn't talked about anyone else so I think he's a single dad. Friday afternoon the kid was waiting by my door and said his dad had told him to stay at my place until he got home. I've only had passing conversations with the man and none about watching his kid so I was very confused. The kid insisted he had the right person and our other neighbor wasn't home so I let him in. \n\nThe kid's phone was dead and I didn't have an android charger. I waited until 8 pm and then took the kid to buy a charger so we could text his dad. His dad still hadn't replied by 10pm and the kid was falling asleep. I didn't know what to do so I just made the couch for the kid to sleep on. The kid said he needed a shower so I got him a towel and a shirt to change into. His dad came to get him at 2pm and acted like it wasn't a big deal. I told him he can't just assume I'll be home and not to do that again and he just laughed. He offered to buy me some beer but I said no because I didn't want him to feel we were even or something. He wanted to exchange phone numbers and made it sound like he'd be asking to repeat me watching his kid so I said no, I don't know anything about kids. \n\nThis morning the dad came over very upset because his son told him that I \"let\" him pee in my shower and didn't make him finish what I gave him for dinner. I told him I had no idea the kid peed in my shower and then the dad was upset that I let his kid shower himself? The kid is seven and I'm pretty sure I was bathing myself by then. Also I am a stranger and a man so no I'm not going to shower someone else's kid? The dad said I am irresponsible and won't be watching his kid again. I said its irresponsible to dump your kid on an unsuspecting stranger and reminded him I already said I wouldn't watch his kid and he cursed me out. I shut the door and he left. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy main question would be what to do if the kid shows up at my place again. But also is it normal for a seven year old to need help showering? I don't think I can call the cops on this but is there like a non-emergency department of CPS I can let know there might be a situation that needs an eye on? Like maybe someone should talk to the kids teachers or family? Should I be looking out for something I can call CPS over or am I just overthinking how weird expecting a casual acquaintance to shower your kid is? I know some parents are just shitty and that doesn't mean they're abusive. ",

            "selftext": "My wife and I live in a 2 bedroom apartment and have twins, a boy and a girl, 3 years old.\u00a0She is in law school while I am working. The apartment is close to her school but almost too far for my drive to work. After she graduates, we will have a 3 or 4 bedroom house near my work built on a lot we already own. At the time we move to the house the twins will have just turned 6.\n\nMy mother has told us very firmly that she think that well before the twins are 6 they should be in separate rooms since they are the opposite sex. She does not think that kids who are\u00a05 or six should be seeing the other sex naked. My mother wants us to move into a 3 BR\u00a0apartment.\n\nIt would be a problem to move now; there are no 3 BR\u00a0apartments available in this neighborhood and my wife and I do have friends, including her classmates, in this complex. Money is not a problem.\n\nMy wife feels that my mother is wrong and that there is no problem. My gut\u00a0feel is\u00a0that my wife is right and that there is no problem. Since I didn't have a sister and my wife didn't have a brother, we have no experience from our childhood.\n\nHowever, I would like to hear opinions\u00a0of you guys. So, should 5 or 6-year-olds of the opposite sex have the same bedroom?",

            "selftext": "My daughter lived with me from 5-14 and with her mom from 14 until 3-4 months before she turned 18. She was having lots of issues with her mom and came to stay with me (2 hours away) until she turned 18 and then was going to move in with her fiance. During these few months she lived with me I urged her to get a job to save up while living bill free so she would have an easier time when she moved out. I didn't force it but brought it up every couple of weeks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt went very well. We have always gotten along but this definitely strengthened our relationship and she said it was one of the best decisions she had ever made to come stay with me. Not super relevant but it was pretty awesome to hear.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen she turned 18 she moved in with her fiance's family. My daughter hadn't gotten a job so hadn't saved up any money. She got a job and six months later my daughter and her fiance had saved a few hundred dollars and were still living with her fiance's family. They broke up and my daughter asked if she could come back to live with me. She said she needed help learning how to be an adult.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm single and had moved to a very small one bedroom apartment during these last few months. Before when she had stayed I was also in a one bedroom but it was much bigger and she had slept in the living room. This new place wasn't big enough for her too. She transferred her job from there to here so she was going to have money from day one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her that last time she had enjoyed living bill free and had chosen not to work and save, but this time I was moving to a new place that was twice as much so she would have room too, so she would have to pay half the rent, bills, and food.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can afford the new place and her half the bills without her paying anything, but the reason I have chosen to live in small one bedroom apartments and gave up some luxuries was specifically to hit pay off my student loan debt quicker. So it felt fair to ask for her to chip in if I had to move in order for her to have room to live with me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe two options I see are either it's fair to ask her to pay half the bills (I've been teaching her how to budget so she's still saving money for an Emergency Fund, has fun money, etc.) or have her pay half the bills and save it all for her without her knowing so when she's ready to move out in a year or so she'll have even more money saved. Friends of mine are split and I know that I often look at issues with a lack of empathy so I figured it was time to reach out to Reddit for advice. What should I do?",

            "selftext": " I posted this on r/Parenting but my post got removed cause I wasn't a parent, so I'm reposting it here.\n\nSo I'm the auntie of a 9 y/o and a 6 y/o, both girls. I have no experience with children whatsoever, but due to some things going on in their family right now, I'm going to be the one responsible for taking care of these two kiddos for quite a while, so bear with me.\n\nThe older one has an extreme aversion to any kind of physical touch. She freaks out over the smallest handshake or high five. If someone accidentally bumps their arm into hers while passing by, she becomes legit frightened/disgusted, winces and takes several steps back like it's the plague. And god forbid someone tries to hug her.\n\nI didn't see this as such a big deal at first. I was like OK, the kid's not the hugging type, fair enough. But when I picked her up from school yesterday, I found her bawling her eyes out, panicking and struggling to even breathe. The reason? The teacher had made up a game for her class to play during recess that involved holding hands and hugging, and had forced her to join in.\n\nAnd then there's also the younger one, who LOVES physical affection and gets really upset when her sister pushes her away. I don't know what to do about her either.\n\nI've read something about Sensory Processing Disorder and tactile sensitivity. The older one shows several of the symptoms: she doesn't like wearing certain clothes, she doesn't like wearing shoes and is barefoot 100% of the time when not in public, she's sensitive to loud noises and certain textures, she's a picky eater, etc. However, none of these are as bad as her aversion to touch. She will wear shoes, she will wear the clothes she doesn't like, she will eat (some) of the food she doesn't like. But there's no way in hell she'll let anyone touch her.\n\nDo any of you have kids with SPD or something similar? What should I do to help the kid? What would you guys do?",

I'm in my early 20s, and I've come out to my blood family as transgender - with strikingly mixed results, but overall apathetic or outright negative. My family is and was largely neglectful, and even abusive. \n\nMy parents never really taught me anything. Seriously, I'm only VERY recently getting *sex education,* and it's from the community. it's *that* bad.\n\nSo, I'm very sorry if this sounds strange, but is there any way I could get any self-care advice, or home care/cooking/baking advice, or relationship advice, or...actually, anything you would say to your own kids? ~~I'm not quite sure how to word my own questions...~~\n\nWhat's a parent supposed to be like, for that matter? I've only ever known familial neglect and abuse. How does it feel to have parents who don't flake out and ignore or hate you? Or good siblings - how do they act? How is family supposed to be?\n\nThank you for reading!\n\nI hope your holidays are going well",

            "selftext": "I'm a senior in high school. My high school requires 40 hours of community service to graduate. I've only completed 6 hours. The reason I was so behind was because throughout high school, I was struggling with terrible anxiety and because of that I was very reluctant to partake in community service.\n\nHowever, I realized I had to start catching up on my community service if I want to graduate. I've been participating in a few activities this year to try to catch up.\n\nI was in the counseling office recently signing up for a service event, and the principal just so happened to be in there. He asked me what was I doing. I told him \"I'm signing up for a community service event.\" He asked me \"How many hours have you completed?\" I told him \"six.\" He was like, \"six?!\". I said, \"Yes, I have some catching up to do.\"\n\nHe told me, \"Here's what I'll do. Since you're a good student and you've worked hard for your grades, I'll just give you the rest of your hours. Don't tell anyone I did this or else I'll make you do 80 hours lol.\"\n\nI can't believe he did this. I told him \"Thank you so much.\" I really appreciate that he gave me all my hours for free. However, I feel guilty because everyone else had to work for all of theirs, while I got mine for free.\n\nI'm having second thoughts. I'm thinking about having him undo what he did, so I can actually work for my hours instead of just getting them for free.\n\nI've talked to my parents about this and they are telling me it would be very stupid of me to do this. They told me, \"You ought to be happy and lucky he did such a nice thing for you.\"\n\nI just feel bad because it's not fair to my classmates and he did something he wasn't supposed to do that could get him in big trouble if I tell anyone.\n\nThis is why I'm asking you guys. Should I just keep my mouth shut and finish high school or tell the principal to undo what he did?",

I'm worried it'll have a negative impact on my relationship with my little girl (6 months old) as it means I'll hardly get to see her during the week. \n\nI've essentially taken the job because the opportunity was fantastic and the money is great too and I thought long term I might be able to support my family better, but I do feel guilty. There's a bit of a commute so it means my little girl will be asleep when I leave in the morning and she will be heading to bed around the time I get home.\n\nShe'll be with her mum in the day until February when maternity leave finishes, I just want to make sure I don't undo the bond we've built so far.\n\nAre any of you in a similar position? If so, how have you coped and did it effect your relationship at all? \n\nThank you!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I have no clue what to do or what to expect .\n\nTHE FULL STORY:\n\nGirlfriend just found out she was pregnant earlier today, probably in her first-second month, likely first. She had to get an abortion for the last pregnancy which was around September/October, but here we go again. She is scared that getting another abortion will kill her because it almost happened to her mom years and years ago (probably didn\u2019t even use the pill like my gf had to). But yeah so everything has been a daze for the past week since we had already been thinking she was pregnant. But she had told me if she decides to keep it and not give it away @ birth that her mom would likely make me live with them at her house with already 8 people living it, 5 of which are her younger siblings. But yeah idk what else I need to say I\u2019m still kinda freaked out. She\u2019s really fucking scared. So am I. I just need recommendations on what to do if :\nA: we keep it and don\u2019t give it away\nB: we should get an abortion\nC: you guys decide what I should do to prepare myself and all that.\n\nPs: I\u2019m trying to act all cool about it but I\u2019m honestly freaking out inside .",

            "selftext": "**TL;DR:**   Wife is purposely dragging feet about switching off of bottle and off of formula for our 1 year old because she has a false belief that the kid is not eating enough.  She is clearly eating enough and the doctor confirms that every time we visit.   Sorry this is a long post. \n\nAs some background info.  My wife and I are on our first kid who\u2019s recently 1 year old.  We had a difficult time conceiving, but in reality, it was only about 11months which a lot of couples I\u2019m sure would dream for.   Because of this I think my wife is way overly protective of keeping the bottle around and is making parenting decisions with emotion instead of fact &amp; reason.  This realization came out of an argument a few months back when I bluntly asked why she was doing the following things regarding breastfeeding and not switching off the bottle:\n\n**Breast feeding:**  My wife wasn\u2019t producing enough milk, maybe about 75% of what we needed.  She understood the concept of keep feeding / pumping it all out regularly as prompt for the body to make more milk and expand production.  The pediatrician recommended continuing breastfeeding, and then use formula to make up the difference of an ideal feeding.  That lasted 2 feedings.    It idea makes sense, but my wife disagreed and every other day would be in tears on how she can\u2019t feed her baby \u201cwhat kind of mom am I if I can\u2019t feed my baby\u201d.  Me and my MIF were like WTF?  So now there\u2019s basically no milk production since she stopped breastfeeding and we\u2019re 100% bottle based on going emotion instead of science.   I tried to explain this a few times, but gave up.    I just figured because she was new at this, tired, etc.\n\n**Bottle/formula:**   From months 2 to 11:   Nearly every day my wife\u2019s mother and I keep hearing from wife how the kid isn\u2019t eating.  The kid is eating and at every doctor\u2019s visit is weighing in at the 60% percentile on weight and above-average length.   We tell her it\u2019s fine and she\u2019s worrying too much.  She doesn\u2019t believe us and keeps saying everyone thinks she\u2019s crazy.  We say no, we don\u2019t think you\u2019re crazy, we just think the kids eating fine and you\u2019re overreacting.  Also, around maybe 9-11 months we\u2019re mixing in solid food and again all we hear how she\u2019s not eating enough.  I believe my wife\u2019s fear is knowing that now formula is in the near future.\n\n**No more bottle:**   At 9 mos. The doctor recommended phasing out the bottle and switching to a sippy cup for the formula.  Seemed reasonable enough.  The wife wanted nothing to do with this and it became a mult-day argument where she made up every nonsense reason not to that she could.  None of her reasons why not to made sense.    Again, she feels like the baby isn\u2019t getting enough (she is!) and then this will disrupt what she\u2019s already getting.  I tried it a few times and the wife even saw me do it; the baby drinks fine from a sippy cup if it was say calm down time before nap/sleep and you hold the child and you\u2019re the one using the sippy cup like a bottle.  The kid also drinks water out of the sippy cup at meals and sure dribbles some on her clothes, but that\u2019s much different from if me or my wife were holding the cup for her and pre-go-to-sleep-time.\n\n**Switching to solid food:**   After 12 mos. Dr visit the doctor says no more formula.  Switch the formula with milk and keep eating solid food.  The wife even knew this was coming, it wasn\u2019t a surprise.  I try it once for dinner, the kid likes milk.  But my wife is still concerned she\u2019s not eating enough solid food to remove the formula, because where\u2019s she going to get her nutrients from?!?!   I try to explain, with no success that, the kid is eating, doctor says kid is eating, the days/meals vary but the Dr says look at the past week overall, not just the last meal.\n\nAlso, if it\u2019s a meal when the kid isn\u2019t eating much and the kid is throwing the food on the ground, then my wife will give her some sugary puffs or Cheerios which are just crap filler.   I expressed my concern that we\u2019re reinforcing bad behavior (the throwing food on ground) by giving an unhealthy reward.  Wouldn\u2019t we be better off stopping dinner right there and hopefully the kid will be hungrier at the next meal? That is to a reasonably extent, I\u2019m not going to starve the kid.  But I\u2019m a monster that doesn\u2019t understand how the kid is starving (she\u2019s not, still at 60% percentile on weight).  So any time the kid doesn\u2019t eat \u00bd a cow my wife is giving her a bottle too.\n\n**Yesterday\u2019s blowup:**  So yesterday morning while wife was out shopping I watched the kid and was feeding her breakfast.  She at a small piece of waffle (about 1.5\u201d x 1.5\u201d), a few bites of apple, some milk, and 3 animal crackers (filler crap I know, but something different from sugar puffs so it wasn\u2019t a reward).  My wife comes up and offers me some suggestions like a BP&amp;J sandwich and others.   I tried one and the kid didn\u2019t want it.  I left it at that since it seemed like she was done, and she\u2019s usually not a big breakfast eater.   So the kid didn\u2019t eat a lot (she\u2019ll often eat light for 2 meals and then eat EVERTYTHING the next meal)  Then began the day long argument / wife crying about how the kid\u2019s not getting enough to eat, and how we can\u2019t switch off formula or bottle.   Also, wife is mad I didn\u2019t follow her suggestions (I did try one to appease her and the kid looked at me like I was an idiot).\n\nThe wife didn\u2019t take it well when she realized we should have been off the bottle to sippy cup only 3 months ago and she is slowing down development.  Not by a lot, I know it\u2019s only a sippy cup, but it\u2019s hard seeing the wife care so much she\u2019s having an adverse effect.  I try to calmly explain this to no avail.  I\u2019m advocating a plan that we\u2019re both for and agree too.  I\u2019m trying to work on the future, not dwell on the past.  Apparently, I\u2019m an asshole for that and now she\u2019s all sad because \u201cshe\u2019s a horrible mother that\u2019s slowing down development\u201d.\n\nSo finally, my wife realized she messed up about the sippy cup.  Trust me, it give me no enjoyment being \u2018right\u2019.   Wife breaks down about hindering the kids development.  Finally we agree our \u201cplan\u201d is right now, do what needed to be done first, phase out the bottle. Not do lots of things at once\u2026just one at a time, so focus is on no bottole, just formula in a sippy cup.  Basic change, right?    Again wife expresses concern.  I reminder her the kid didn\u2019t care what format the formula is served via.  Wife goes to try it before kids afternoon nap after wife being emotional all day.  Kid drinks \u00bd of it.  I can see wife is starting to flare up about \u201cthe kid not eating enough/getting enough\u201d again.  Kid keeps playing with the handles on the cup and starts a tug of war with my wife.  Instead of being calm and thinking of a way to outsmart the 1 yr old, wife freaks out, says she can\u2019t do it, and leaves the room.  I pick up kid, give it pacifier, calm it down, read a quick book, and pick up cup again.  Kid drinks it just fine while wife walks back in the room.   Wife all emotional again, thinks she\u2019s horrible, and now I\u2019m afraid she\u2019s getting jealous that the kid drank it fine from me.  In reality the kid was drinking fine for her but just got distracted\u2014no different that if it was a bottle.  \n\n**This morning:** So I get out of the shower after hearing my wife arguing with the 1 year old.  Again, kid isn\u2019t eating solid breakfast and not drinking formula out of sippy cup.  This is totally normal, the kid isn\u2019t a big breakfast eater and usually doesn\u2019t eat until being awake for 1-2 hours;  this was first thing in the morning.   Wife somehow disregards that and has a break down.  I come out, kid sees me and wants me to hold her.  Kid is happy I picked her up while I make coffee.   Wife sees this and says she can\u2019t bear to watch this and storms off to work.    The kid still likes my wife.  The kid wants my wife to hold the kid when waking up in morning or when wife gets home from work.  Kid doesn\u2019t like me better or anything.  But my wife sees it differently I guess.\n\n\nSo basically, my wife is way over stressed.  Making odd decisions, has this weird fear the kid is not eating enough when it is.  I try to help out all I can, and offer to take over certain duties so my wife can take a break.  But it\u2019s like she doesn\u2019t trust me because the kid won\u2019t get enough food.     I\u2019m trying to be gentle about this, trying to work with my wife and not being too overly demanding.  But it\u2019s getting weird.   Has anyone seen this?    Any ideas on how I can work with my wife so she basically takes a chill pill, can see the kid is eating enough, and follow through on getting rid of the bottle and eventually the formula?\n\nThanks.",

We just started reading so we haven't gotten very far.\n\nMy friends who are parents have told me all of the horror stories like kids crapping out of their diaper and up their back, not sleeping at night, and the financial bind they were in. These are pretty standard stories I've heard and I'm not super worried about things like this. During the pregnancy and after the birth, what's something(s) that the books, family, and friends didn't teach you that you had to learn the hard way?\n\nAny input would be appreciated. Maybe I can learn a lesson vicariously through you guys.\n\nThank you all!",

            "selftext": "Hello, I'm a mum of two wonderful boys, 2,5 years and 10 months old. The toddler has been very difficult to handle lately. He gets the worst tantrums over nothing and doesn't like going to sleep anymore. He always used to like going to bed, so that's a big change. I think part of his problem with it is losing control over the situation. He doesn't get to decide whether or not it's time for bed. His baby brother was a very bad sleeper in the first 6 or so months of life (waking up every 2 hours at night) and was finally improving up until he was about 8 months old. A very bad sleep regression started and it was like having a newborn all over again. He is definitely doing a bit better already, but the last week or so he has a new thing: waking up at about 10pm and being super awake for about an hour or even 2. Last night he did this too. Takes ages and a bottle of milk to get him to go to sleep again. It doesn't seem like he's not trying, he's just not tired. But last night he actually did this thing twice, at 10pm and also at about 4:45am. I'm just so tired and stressed, as there seems to never be any time to relax. The toddler is also still waking up at night, anywhere between 0 and 3 times a night. At night when they are finally down I can't really relax, all I feel is scared that they will wake up again. I also work 3 days a week and I'm just exhausted. Even though my husband does a lot of the work and he's wonderful. I sometimes don't like my kids anymore. I know it's all a phase and all, but it's taking ages and I just feel down lately. It seems like an endless nightmare and I am never able to relax anymore. I'm not getting any more fun as a mum, or wife, and I hate that. Do you guys ever experience these feelings and could I actually become depressed over this constant tension I feel? I want to be me again. Any advice is very welcome! ",

I simply laughed it off, sat on Mikes bed, and asked him nicely to tell me, I told him I wouldn\u2019t tell our parents. He started crying, probably from embarrassment, which I understand. And he confessed. He admitted he was searching up Boobs. Now in my mind, I\u2019m think he just searched up boobs on google images or something, so it was pretty funny to me. I laughed it up with him, cracked a joke, making him smile a bit, and stop crying. And being the best big brother ever, I told him I would delete his history for him, so he wouldn\u2019t get embarrassed if someone saw. I went downstairs, found his tablet, and for the fun of it, I typed boob in the search bar, so previous searches with that keyword would appear. There were around four, all links to pornhub. They were all videos of girls with either large breasts, or them showing them off. This was a little disturbing, but I shrugged it off, and went to his history to delete it, and that\u2019s where I saw even more links to the site. Forget \u201cboobs\u201d, I saw \u201cplumber x milf\u201d, etc. I saw hardcore vanilla stuff. I wasn\u2019t pleased, I felt sick, I got nervous as all hell, and deleted the history. I did not know how to react. I ran upstairs, and went back to my brother, and tried asking where he learned about this stuff, and the only response I got was \u201cI just knew about it!\u201d. I know it\u2019s very easy for children to see this stuff, since so many of them have electronics these days, but I never saw porn until I was in grade seven. And I thought that was early! \n\nI asked a friend, and he said I should talk to him about, basically give him a summed up, and more child friendly version of the birds and bees chat. I\u2019m only seventeen, so I\u2019m not at all an expert on this stuff. The whole thing is kinda stressful, I feel like I need to do something, but not sure what. I promised I wouldn\u2019t tell my parents, but if it comes down to it, I suppose I\u2019ll have to, but if possible I\u2019d like to avoid that. \nIt\u2019s been two days, so if I do anything, it\u2019s now or never. What do I do? ",

It didn\u2019t break but my husband got a little bit upset about it. So we decided that we would take a \u201cbreak\u201d from the game as a sort of \u2018punishment\u2019  It was an accident, so I don\u2019t actually believe he\u2019s in any trouble. I\u2019ve done my best to make it clear to him that he\u2019s not in trouble but we\u2019re still taking a break until he can be a little bit more careful. I had planned on the break only been for a couple of days.\n\nFast forward to a couple of days and I planned on letting him use it yesterday but it just never came up we weren\u2019t in the home so it wasn\u2019t an issue. I had to work last night and my husband had our son for the day and apparently my son asked to play it. But my husband didn\u2019t understand the punishment I guess even though we had discussed it? And he told our son that he can\u2019t because he\u2019s in trouble\u2026 I feel terrible because he\u2019s not in trouble. when I asked my husband why he didn\u2019t just end the break he said he didn\u2019t know if He could or not. How do I make him understand that he is the other half of this partnership he has as much right to make decisions as I do.\n\nI\u2019ve gone back to work part time, And my husband has my son alone every weekend, so I just want him to understand that if he makes rules or he makes decisions I\u2019ll hundred percent standby them. But he has the right to make any of these decisions. I feel like he doesn\u2019t feel like he can? How do I make him understand that we\u2019re in this together? This is not the first incident that this is happened, I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t be the last. I just want to know how to boost his confidence as a dad?\n\n\n\nP.s.  this is my fist reddit post, so be gentle :)",

She refuses to get a job, take drivers ed, she is barely on course to graduate, etc etc.  \n\nThatKid and Mom are talking over the weekend and TK mentions that she read somewhere that the average move out age for people is almost 30 now (no idea if that is factual, just giving details).  Mom flips out and says that TK will be out of the house on her 18th birthday, Job or not, Drivers License or not, Place to go or not. \n\nMom isn't budging, TK has \"given up on life\" saying she will just be homeless and die in the street.\n\nI see Moms point (TK is not even trying to get ready for life) but I have no idea how to handle this situation.  I'm here for any advice, wisdom, similar stories, etc.  If you have any questions or need some details, feel free to ask.\n\nThanks\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "selftext": "I don't know if this belongs here but I hope it does\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI need help with perspective and advice for this situation. This is a sensitive topic and mentions possible abuse or possible medical problem in private locations.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQuick background: I'm not a parent, never had kids. I have a degree in forensic psychology and took a class on developmental psychology as well as abnormal to name a few. So I have knowledge in the psychological behavior of adults, and children as well as other topics and areas. This is about my 5 year old niece. Just to add, the relationship between my niece's mother and I is complicated. She is my biological sister but I no longer speak to her. My mom does the communication between us. Also, my niece's parents are not together (they never married but have shared custody). Her father lives in one state and her mother lives in the same state as me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo start, my niece has been showing signs of abuse. Whether it is self-inflicted or done by someone else or both. Whenever I dry her off after a bath I noticed her \"little place\" is red. And not just the front, but the back place too. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first time I noticed it, I asked if her panties caused the redness and she replied with \"Yes\". But then later, when her mom came to pick her up from my house, she became angry at my niece and asked \"Are you touching yourself down there again?\". My niece said no but then her mother threatened to tell my niece's dad. My niece became distressed and begged her not to tell. Afterwards, they left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few days later and the redness was gone which was great. But then, two days ago I noticed it was back. However, this time, her \"little place looked bruised. When I asked my niece, and I was careful to ask leading or assuming questions, what happened she told me \"she slapped herself down there\" then proceeded to demonstrate by smacking herself down there. I thought there was more to it then that. I followed up with, \"Why would you hit yourself down there?\". She said she didn't know why. I told her to tell me the truth and that if she understands that lying was wrong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know why but I asked \"are you protecting someone?\" and she replied that it's just hitting down there.then again smacked herself several times down there.... And I asked \"why\". She said \"because she liked him.\" Then, I asked if she could tell me who and she said no, cover her faced and wouldn't look at me for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I don't think I handled it well at all even though I studied this in college. But my niece is definitely showing troubling signs. I even googled what it might be and it says it might be caused by an infection. However, my niece's behavior indicates she's touching and hurting herself down there. I want her to go see a doctor and/or specialist (child psychologist) to see what is going on. I keep telling my mom to tell my niece's mom but she seems to treat it like it's no big deal when there are this huge red flags that something is wrong with my niece. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhether it's an infection, self-abuse and/or a guy/man abusing her, it all needs to be dealt with. Yet my mother and my niece's mother don't seem to take this matter seriously. A 5 year old has her little place red and sometimes bruised and these people just treat it like it's just something that would pass.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy niece is already abused in other ways. She's yelled at a lot and disciplined by hitting, so because of that she's very aggressive. Her mother is also negligent at times. She's so absorbed on her phone and ignores her own daughter at times. Because of this, I noticed my niece acts out whenever her mom is on her phone (not when she's talking but texting, cruising, etc.). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI need help and insight. I was thinking of going to my niece's pre-school for help. Can the school psychologist/counselor help if her mother refuses to do anything about it?",

Yes parenting is tiring and requires non stop attention every moment your kid is awake, so instead of being pessimistic about it I will rise to the challenge and engage with them for as long as my significant other can take over. This does not mean I will be dominating their attention toward myself, I will let them explore if thats what they want to do.\n\nIs there anything I am failing to take into account?

            "selftext": "How do you cook 3 meals a day plus snacks and do kid activities and do laundry and keep your house clean and are on time for appointments???\n\nI have an almost 4-year-old and a 4-month-old. I'm on mat leave (18 months) so I don't have to work or anything but i find it extremely overwhelming. My day is made up of (what feels like) hundreds of small, menial, mundane tasks. I find it very repetitive and boring. I can't effectively establish a daily or weekly routine because I dont know how to prioritize. My house is a mess and even when I do manage to get it clean it's messy again in 0.02 seconds. I don't know what to make for breakfast or lunch or dinner, let alone snacks. I try to take the kids outside at least once a day but leaving the house might as well be impossible at this point. I lack the necessary organizational skills required for the household to run smoothly and am ALWAYS behind on chores. I should mention that I never really liked cooking and cleaning. I'm coming around to the cooking (practice makes perfect). I worked as a housemaid for over a year but can't get my house clean if my life depended on it. I'm starting to get the older one more involved in house chores, which makes it 20x more difficult sometimes, but I'm hoping it will be worth it eventually. I also put him in daycare 2 days a week to have some 'me time' (to clean a bathroom maybe?) but on the days he has daycare I find myself rushing around when it's time to drop him off and then again to pick him up. I won't take him out of daycare because it allows him to socialize with kids his age and gets him ready for a school environment, not to mention it would make him sad because he loves it. I'm also late to every appointment ever. I just wish someone would make a detailed schedule for me to follow and hold me accountable for doing productive stuff. I always thought of myself as very capable person... now I'm not so sure about that.. I feel so incompetent.",

            "selftext": "Maybe too specific but the other thread is for HS. My daughter just turned 11 and is in 6th grade. She said the teacher was reprimanding the class about making sure they do their assigned job in regards to doing morning announcements. My daughter stated previously she did not want to do morning announcements as she suffers greatly from anxiety and shyness. (I'm not looking for advice on this. This is something we are handling with her doctor). She said she felt when the teacher was reprimanding the class, the teacher was looking specifically at her so she felt she needed to respond. She said \"its Leah's job\" for morning announcements. Teacher told her to go out to the hall immediately. My daughter did and instantly broke down crying (again, something I am working with her on to be able to confidently stand up for herself without becoming overly emotional). Teacher asked why she said what she did and my daughter said because she felt she was speaking to her because she was looking at her. Teacher tells her \"mia, not everything is about you. Go to the bathroom and clean yourself up\". I feel this is highly inappropriate. This is also not the first time my daughter has had problems with her. 2 years ago my daughter complained that she was physically yanked out of line by this teacher. I called the school, it was \"investigated\" by the principal and the teacher said it didn't happen. There was nothing to do but accept it even though i know my daughter didn't simply make it up. So we let it go. My daughter is not a trouble maker. These are the only two things I have ever had her complain about. Just went to PT conf with this teacher last week where she said mia is shy but kind. So certainly not some kind of bad kid. Not sure what to do here. Don't want to make the school year rough for her by complaining. And feel like this may be a good learning opportunity for mia to practice sticking up for herself without becoming emotional. But then worried this may be a bit to aggressive. ",

I told his that I had informed out daughter that if she didn't clean up her room (would take maybe fifteen minutes) she wouldn't get any.\n\n Later, I decided I wanted some. I paid for it. I'm an adult.\n\n So he sees me getting it and gets pissed because \"it's not right off me to eat it in front of her because she will be upset\" so he calls her to come in the room. I get mad. I told him off because: \n1. She was already in bed \n2. She didn't clean her room one little bit and was told until she did, no ice cream\n\nHe told me I was a basically a shitty parent because me eating the ice cream I paid for (after working almost 28 hours overtime) was mean. That our eight year old would get her feelings hurt. \ud83d\ude31  \n\nI tried to explain that an eight year old who doesn't do her chores didn't get rewards and he told me that if she didn't get any I shouldn't either. \n\nHonestly it was stupid and irritating and I feel I was right for standing my ground. He's still talking shit to me over it. I ended up not eating any and just throwing my bowl away.\n\nMy question is, am I over reacting? Was he wrong for doing it saying that? I feel that if I tell her something I should stand behind it, but when he does things like that I feel it undermines everything I work hard to teach her.\n\nI know the argument seems kind of stupid, but these things are continuous.

I'm genuinely seeking honest, experienced advice on this.    \n\n\nWe see each other at least a few times a week. Our kids love to play together.   \n\n\nOne family has taught their child manners. They feel that manners (hello, please, thank you, good-bye) are a matter of habit, and they insist their child uses them. Not all the time, but most of the time. The other family has not taught manners. They believe that the child will begin to use manners when they feel it is appropriate, and that the feelings and sensitivities of the child are more important than social norms.  \n\n\nObviously these are polar opposite parenting styles that come into contact often. Most of the time, it goes smoothly, but sometimes there are instances where it does not. The child who hasn't been taught manners will tell a non-parent adult that they want something, like a cup of water. Then they don't say thank you.   \n\n\nDo you think it's appropriate for the non-parent to elicit a 'thank you' from the child?   \n\n\nThe parents on both side of the fence feel pretty strongly about this issue. While mutual respect is important, how do we navigate these interwoven situations when we are in contact so often? ",

            "selftext": "My daughter is 7 and I am at my wits fucking end.  She has been soiling herself pretty regularly over the past month predominantly after she broke her arm.  Her arm is now out of the cast and there has been no improvement in her cleanliness.  This has been an ongoing issue for her for several year but this is the worst it\u2019s ever been. We were trying to be more lenient due to her arm and limited range of movement and fear we just made it way worse. \n\nThe biggest issue now is that she seems to get feces slathered all over her cheeks that she doesn\u2019t wipe well or at all.  Neither her father nor I can tell if she is not having a BM or if this is leaking she is unaware of. Our doctor is basically useless on this topic and always has been saying to give her miralax, which just exacerbates the issue no matter how long we\u2019ve stuck to it. We\u2019ve done some more research and are going to try a senna based laxative in case she is impacted to try and make that move. We\u2019ve found that may be more beneficial if she actually does have encopresis as miralax won\u2019t urge her to go where as the senna will actually urge her to go. \n\nShe has gotten to the point that she is hiding her soiled clothing and lying about it as well and even throwing away soiled items to avoid dealing with it. I\u2019ve asked repeatedly if she knows she had to go, why she does this, why she won\u2019t wipe properly.  I sent her to school today in a pull up. She has a myriad of excuses as to why this as an issue.  None of which actually make sense.\n\nWhat do I do about this. I have no pediatric gastroenterologists in my town.  The closest is 2 hours away, but I\u2019ll definitely make the trip if needed.  I am sick of it, I\u2019m sick of the smell, the unhygienic nature, and I\u2019m sick of all the lying and fighting over it.   \n\nAll advice welcome. ",

You get it. \n\nI'm going to have some beer sitting in a separate ice chest for adults only (obviously). Didn't even occur to me this would be controversial but a person I mentioned it to in passing made it sound like a big ole' deal. Some parents might be \"offended\" by alcohol being present because it's a kids party? I was stunned because that just sounds like the most prudish, repressed, judgmental nonsense to me. \n\nThe party isn't centered around alcohol. For real, how ridiculous. I don't remember any parties without dads holding beers in hand standing around the grill. It's a literal vision of Americana. We've just settled into a new home and school district so a lot of invitees will be new friends. I googled this and found some pretty insane comments from what I have to imagine are the ghosts of actual puritanical pilgrims masquerading as modern adults. \n\nPlease tell me I'm not alone in thinking its completely and totally reasonable to serve your guests a beer at a family/kids party. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

            "selftext": "I live in an apartment building and the family below me has a 10 year old daughter and an 8 year old son.  Since I first moved in the girl has been really interested in me, asks me a lot of questions, holds the door open for me when I'm carrying something heavy etc. These are nice, hallway interactions and I always let her take the lead - I don't ask her lots of questions but do answer hers. We talk a bit about school, my tattoos, the weather, birthdays, favourite colours and animals... So far so fine. Neighbourly, community vibes etc. I'm a 26 year old woman for what it's worth and I live alone. \n\nThe problem is that the girl and her brother are CONSTANTLY asking me when we can hang out. In fact, she's been asking and I've been avoiding for over a year. However, recently I helped her family get back into their flat when they got locked out at midnight and that culminated in me relenting and saying that she and her brother could come over for tea that weekend (I was very tired, and immediately regretted it but couldn't take it back). They came over for tea at 11am on a Saturday morning. I had made sure to tell them to ask their parents for permission and I'm on smiling terms with the dad so they know who I am, where I live etc. We hung out for an hour, ate some cake, played with my guitar, drew some trees and looked at the world map. It was fine but I don't want a repeat. The whole time the girl kept saying she's so excited we're finally hanging out and can we hang out again.\n\nMy concern isn't security or \"how it looks\". My concern is that I just don't want to hang out! My weekends are my weekends and my evenings are my evenings and I want to spend none of that time hanging out with kids that I'm not related to or being paid to look after.  I like kids, used to babysit and was an au pair, so it's not that I'm uncomfortable with children. I just don't wanna hang out. \n\nMy first instinct would be to talk to the parents and ask them to have a word with the kids but the parents and I don't share a language so that's not an option. \n\nSo dear parents, sorry for rambling, but how would you recommend saying to a 10 year old who lives right below you and you see nearly every day that you don't want to hang out ever again without breaking her heart? Should I just go for broke and make it awkward? Should I keep saying \"maybe next week\" ad infinitum? Help.",

I often go over to his house and hangout after work or after school until my curfew (12 am). It would be a lot easier if on a weekend I could simply sleep over there, I enjoy spending time with him and don\u2019t see the big deal with a sleepover. We have never had sex and personally I\u2019m not ready (I\u2019m not a virgin but I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s right currently as I am more involved in my faith now) he never pushes me and even though we are often alone never go farther, he is very respectful. We\u2019ve had sleepovers before at my house but only when my parents aren\u2019t home. I\u2019ve asked my parents and they think it is crazy I want to sleepover at his house, I\u2019m asking is it??

This is our first and definitely a handful learning how to take care of him and keep him happy and healthy!\n\nI took one week off of work as I had just started a new job and had one week of vacation to use. We spent that first week with her mom as she taught us different techniques on holding/feeding/changing etc... She was no doubt a life saver as she got us much more comfortable around him. \n\nNow I\u2019m back at work so she has the days with him. I can\u2019t imagine doing that and give her a ton of credit because she can\u2019t really leave or rely on anyone but her when she\u2019s home alone. We chose to breast feed and supplement formula if needed. So when he\u2019s hungry she takes care of him.\n\nDuring the overnight period I feel terrible because I can\u2019t feed him due to not having bottles or breastmilk in the fridge. She lets me sleep through the night and gets up every 3 or so hours to feed him.\n\nI want to do more for her as she is definitely feeling the effects of not having enough sleep. What are some things I can do to help her? I\u2019m usually gone 9-6 throughout the day. I try and clean up the house when I get home or whatever I can do to help. \n\nThanks",

I've told him to put his badge on the door knob, put it in his bag when he comes back from school, nevertheless he finds a way to forget it all the time. \n\nMay the idea of paying $1 is to punish the kid but really it just punishes the guardian's wallet, now I'm not penniless but if this continues I could be paying up to $100 by the end of the school year, which is just really ridiculous for me.\n\nThe school requires the students to pay this fee or serve lunch detention until they do, also after 2 weeks they will get suspended (can a public school even do that? what happened to free public education?).\n\nI am thinking of going in and talking to the vice principal or someone about this, or am I just really over-reacting?",

            "selftext": "I'm gonna show this to my stupid mother. At least I think she's a stupid mother. I am checking with you all. I just turned 24 and this week I had to call my dad because he is on my AAA insurance and was getting my bill, cause of my old address and our family plan. He somehow got into talking to \"how he would really like to see me with a whip, whipping men at the car dealership as a boss. That would be so hot.\" then he said \"I'm gonna dream about that tonight.\" I literally flung back my phone. I yelled at him, and he got super fucking creepy about it. He even said \"wait, you heard that? I thought I was just thinking it.\" Then I just hung up. I told my mom, and she says the same thing she has ALWAYS said with him: \"oh, he's so stupid. just ignore him.\" I used to hit my mother as a child because I was so mad at her for making me \"ignore\" him when he would get drunk and try to suffocate me with pillows. IDIOT mother is still married to him, says she can't get a divorce unless my sister and I get really rich (great, no pressure). Long story short, I want to know if this is truly normal, if dads are supposed to say shit like that. I once asked my mother if my dad ever raped me and she said no, but I am getting worried maybe he did and I repressed it. He used to do things like grab my ass as a teenager and ask me to tighten it. My mom says \"that's just him being funny.\" I am a lesbian and so is my sister, and I cannot help but think maybe something fucked up happened. But my mom says I am overreacting, that's why I need parents of Reddits help.",

Not quite sure how to process it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy son (5) made friends with a girl in his pre-k class last year.  We've had a few interactions with her family over the summer (she and her mom came to our house to play, their whole family came over for my son's birthday party, and we went to the girl's birthday party in her apartment) and they seemed nice enough and very eager to make friends.  I did get a weird vibe from her father, but not a dangerous one... more like \"this is not a person to trust.\"  At no point has there been anything improper.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday something unrelated prompted me to check the sex offender registry for the town I live in, something I hadn't done since we moved here 4 years ago.  My stomach twisted to find the father's name listed.  He is a level 3 (high risk of re-offense).  Date of crime was in 2001.  Conviction is Sodomy, 2nd degree.  Victim is a non-stranger, female, 13/14 years old.  Offense descriptions:  Deviate Sexual Intercourse, Sexual Contact, Sexual Intercourse, Promoting/Possessing Sexual Performance by a Child.  No weapon, no force.  The sentence was 18 months to 3 years in state prison.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI obviously do not want my children (son, and 3 year old daughter) to have any additional contact with this man.  My son and his daughter are in different classes this school year, but will most likely be riding the same bus, which is really how they became good friends last year.  I don't want to tell my son he can't be friends with this girl, who has done nothing wrong, but how can I support this friendship if there is a chance her father will be home, or might come along with her and her mom if we invite them over?  If I decide that they are not allowed to see each other outside of school -which sucks for the kids- how do I explain that  to my son?  How would I repeatedly put off requests from the girl's mom without outright saying I'm afraid of her husband?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo I tell this information to other moms that will have their children be playing with this family?  (There is one other mom in particular I am thinking of.  I'm not good friends with her but we are friendly.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am horrified and unsure of what to think.  Any input will help me sort this out mentally.  Thank you in advance!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

She was always the calm, collected, intelligent one whereas I was the high-strung temperamental one who got into trouble.\n\nSix months ago, she and her husband left on a holiday recently and entrusted their 8 year old to me for two weeks. My husband was on a business trip, so I was alone with her before and after school.\n\nI am a modest woman. I have not much material wealth and I wear shoes that are 10 years old. The one thing I do prize above all else is my chess set. It was a family heirloom and my mother gave it to me 2 months before she committed suicide. Everybody in my life knows how fiercely protective I am of this set. When I first saw my niece touching that set, I shouted at her, telling her that I will become a 'very angry person' if I see her touch it again. She was moved to tears, so I thought she had learnt her lesson.\n\nUnfortunately, she did not. Sometime in the night, while I was sleeping, a light went off in the living room. I dismissed it, thinking that she might be drinking some water. But the next day, she tearfully approached me and confessed that she had played with the board a few times and last night, she saw that one of the white bishop was missing. She said she searched for hours and hours before finally giving up.\n\nIn hindsight, I know what the right decision was. I should have gently wiped off her tears, thank her for being honest and tell her to search with me. But that is not what happened. I struck her. Punched, slapped, kicked and spat at her. I was also crying the whole while.\n\nWhen I was completely exhausted, I stopped and warned her to never tell her mom or the \"punishment will be more severe\"\n\nEverything changed between us. She stopped hugging me, stopped speaking childishly to me and stopped playing with me. Every time I visit my sister's house, she makes excuses to go outside with her friends and acts fearfully around me.\n\nTalked to my husband about this yesterday and he was upset with me. He called me \"abusive\" and told me that because of me, she will not trust adults and will not be honest with her mistakes anymore. He said that if I don't tell my sister what happened within the week, he will.\n\nPersonally, I don't agree. I think what happened was a brief lapse of judgement and not \"abusive\". Please tell me how can I confess to my sister what I did? Also, please tell me how can I ensure that she will not be upset with me?\n\nP.S: The chess-piece was found weeks later, when I was giving the house a thorough cleaning.",

            "selftext": "Ok parents. This is going to perhaps seem like a very \"out-there\", random question. I've been browsing the posts on /r/childfree and they honestly make having kids sound like the worst thing, ever. This group simultaneously fascinates me and freaks me out at the same time. \n\nWhat's your take on that sub, and the reality of having kids in general? \n\nI chuckle at myself and how much I let their posts influence me, because after all, they DON'T have kids and they never will so they can't exactly speak from a place of experience. But I do get very uneasy when I read their \"sticky\" threads about parental regret and things like that. \n\nBut it's not just /r/childfree. Sometimes I'm on social media and I find a post about \"the reality of life after kids\". Downtrodden parents, looking horrendously tired, covered in a mountain of baby feces. Real-life confessions about how people's marriages and relationships have sustained irrepairable damage after having kids. Stretched-to-the-limit moms and dads with no free time. Yes, I get that it's definitely like that for the first few years. But is it as equally as horrible for the entire stretch? \n\nMy friend even told me that \"Having kids is the best, worst thing that has happened to me\". Wtf? \n\nA childfree friend, on the topic of kids, said \"And when will you be able to read a book again? Kiss that goodbye for 18 years!\" I laughed inside thinking \"Shit, you really think that dude?\" but then I started to wonder... It was always my understanding that children got really self-sufficient around the age of 7 and could entertain themselves if the parents wanna do their own thing for an afternoon. \n\nIt's honestly a wonder why anyone reproduces in the first place after hearing all of these \"confessions\". So, parents, shoot me straight. How completely horrible IS having kids, exactly? I only seem to hear about how horrendous, tiring, soul-crushing it is. \n\nThere was even a study out there... this. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2015/08/11/the-most-depressing-statistic-imaginable-about-being-a-new-parent/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.cdf332a09f5f about how having a baby makes people generally unhappier than death, divorce, or unemployment. As a parent, what are your thoughts on that?? \n\nI want to hear all of this, first-hand, from REAL parents. \n\nThank you, signed, \nConfused Why So Many People Make a Life Choice That Apparently Makes Them Beyond Miserable - or Does It?

Please don\u2019t tell me that\u2019s normal because a freaking 3 month old should be able to go AT LEAST stretches of 3 hours, if not more. \nBackground- healthy, breastfed baby. Weighs 13 lbs. My wife gave up dairy last week, we\u2019ve done infant chiropractic, bedtime baths, lavender lotion, routines, gripe water, nested beans, magic Merlin, white noise, warmer room, cooler room, a halo, a pack and play, a swaddle me cosleeper, and I\u2019m sure a hundred fucking other things that work so well for every other asshole on the internet but don\u2019t work for us. She won\u2019t even nap during the day unless she\u2019s being held. We\u2019ve tried holding her for 20-30 min, then putting her in a rock and play, bassinet, crib, etc and she wakes up damn near immediately. Same thing at night. Will not sleep unless she is being held. As you can probably tell it is wearing me the hell out. I can\u2019t go another 3 months until solid food like this, I will have a mental breakdown.  I love that damn kid but she is making me a crazy person at night. \nThings that won\u2019t help me because they are not an option: cosleeping, formula feeding, rice cereal in her bottle, car rides (she sleeps when the car is moving but wakes up immediately upon being removed from the car seat), sleeping in a car seat, schedules (how the HELL can you manage a schedule when she won\u2019t goddamn sleep during the prescribed sleep times, only cries and wants to be held or entertained), sleeping basically anywhere that\u2019s not a flat surface. \nPlease help, I\u2019m going nuts here and can\u2019t take reading any more about how well any of this stuff worked for your kid. Please don\u2019t tell me it gets better because people have been saying that for 3 months and it has not and I cannot see how it will at this rate. ",

We live in a suburban town connected to a major city via subway (which is how we're currently getting to appointments with our midwife) and with a decent bus transportation. Grocery store, pharmacy, and mall are within walking distance (&lt;1 mile). \n\nWe get around mostly by bicycle. I do have a driver's license and can occasionally borrow one of my parents' cars (both are very close to retirement) when we need/want to go out of town. Obviously it will be at least a few months before we'll put the baby in a bike trailer/seat, and we don't know where the pediatrician's office will be, but I feel like we got this. We can always take a Lyft if we need it.\n\nAnybody else out there raising a baby in the suburbs or small town where car ownership is basically a given? I'm bracing myself for the criticism (\"It's too cold to walk your baby\"; \"Biking your baby isn't safe\"; \"What if there's an emergency?!\"). Any tips or ideas about what we may be overlooking?",

Pretty much all the comments agreed that she should fire her sitter over this.  I was baffled because she said the sitter has never smoked around her kids, but still wanted to fire her for a personal choice outside of her job.  I was also offended because I smoke (from a vaporizer) outside of my babysitting job, and I would be infuriated if I was fired for that, as it's none of my bosses' business.\n\nSo, is a babysitter's smoking habit a dealbreaker for you, even if it's never around your kids?",

            "selftext": "I am left with no other option as I am almost totally without money now. I went wrong in so many places with money. Unable to stick at jobs due to stress and what often feels like depression etc. I have terrible spending habits, not major purchases but regular cheap ones. I live with my parents. Stripping is the last card I have to play as no one seems to think I'm intelligent but people seem to think I'm pretty. I am hired somewhere else as a healthcare assistant but it's taking a while to get a shift as it is bank work (meaning they call me in when someone is sick or they need an extra hand). I feel fine about stripping personally, but I hate the the thought of dishonouring my parents or hurting their pride if they found out. And I am quite close with them, so lying to them about where I am going is going to kill me. I am so worried that if they found out, they would throw me out or blame themselves. \n\nThey are the most amazing people. But of course traditional at times and believe in certain values.\n\nI think I may have bipolar but I am very silent about it. I tend to act on impulse when significant ideas come into my head and then a day or a week later I am really confused as to why I did that. Happens a lot. I often try to make decisions where the both of me would agree upon. My work performance has always constantly fluctuated, never been consistent and I secretly worry that this is a reflection of my mental state. I have a constant fear that something bad is going to happen. This could be why I create bad things to happen. No one knows of these thought processes that go through my head. People see me as calm and the clown of the group. Just thought I'd give you some background to myself. I'm also very family oriented. Without family, I would not want to be here anymore.\n\nSo my question is, how would you feel or react as a parents if your daughter in her early-mind twenties started stripping? And also, if you found out she was lying to you for a long time? ",

            "selftext": "I really want to be a mom. I feel it in my stomach and my heart that I was born to be a mom. Whenever I see a baby, my stomach does a jealous twist. I play with my nieces and nephews for hours, and I just love baby sitting, but I always feel so sad at the end when I need to give the kid back. I just know that my life's purpose is to be a mother.\nBut I have two philosophical questions about this, that is causing me a lot of grief. Firstly: Why do I want to bring a child into this world? For me. Every time I start to think about the answer to this question, it always starts with \"I want\". \"I want a child\". \"I want to be a mother\". \"I want to show my child the great parts of life\". And then I think about my potential child, and I ask \"does my potential child want this?\" And the answer is of course, \"no, because it is impossible for a non-existent being to want anything\". So if I can't do it for my child, then I am just doing it for me, which makes it a fairly selfish act. And on top of that, I would then be bringing a child into this world for 80 years, for something that I wanted, that they didn't ask for. Is that fair?\nThis then leads me onto the second question: If my child hasn't asked to be born, and I am doing this for selfish reasons, am I at least giving my child something that they could want?\nMost of us agree that it is not a great thing to have a child with Down Syndrome. The risk increases from 1 in 1200 at 25 to 1 in 100 by age 40. This is why people try to have children as early as possible. However, if I have a girl, then there is a 1 in 6 chance that she will be raped. There is a 100% chance that her parents will die. There is a 100% chance that her husband will die. If she chooses to have a child, there is a 30% chance that she will miscarry and her baby will die. There is a 17% chance that she will be depressed at some time during her life.\nAre these risks something that I can force onto my potential child? Something that she hasn't asked for? She will be dragged out of nothingness and into this world with a 1 in 6 chance of being raped, because I wanted to be a mother. Because of something that I want, and she was never asked.\nSo this is my dilemma, that I am struggling with and extremely conflicted over. How do I balance my desires over the reality of creating a new human being, with the knowledge of all that it entails? How did you personally come to terms with this dilemma, and how did you ultimately decide that the balance tipped in favor of having children?",

I've tried pull ups, tried having him wear underwear tried having him run around pantless and every time he's not got his nappy on when he does a wee he screams the house down. Is he just not ready ?

            "selftext": "throw away for obvious reasons.\n\nOkay, so my name is Sam and i'm 17, almost 18 and a senior in hs, and like a lot of people my age I decided to try and wear a thong. I didn't think it was that big of a deal, but when I talked to my mom about it she definintely wasn't thrilled. I ended up getting them anyway, and by chance was wearing them to dinner at an upscale resteraunt, and I guess the back of my thong was accidentily sticking out above my pants... I didn't think that much of it, thats just another way to wear thongs but my stepfather apparently did, and he mentioned something to my mother. She told me later that I wasn't allowed to wear thongs and I did kind of lose it on her, I just hate having panty lines and lots of people wear their thong showing anyway. I didn't think it was a big deal if I wanted to let my thong show. She seemed like she caved and was going to let me wear them, until I came home and she called me downstairs. All of my thongs were in a pile cut into peices on the kitchen table. (she had bought them for me in the first place) and there was a 3 pack of new thongs for me. The only difference was these ones are an extra small when I usually wear a medium, and a very thin g string style. She told me that if I had to wear thongs they would need to be the kind i couldn't wear above my pants, so she got me something that was too small for that. It's now the only underwear that I have. I tried to wear it to school but it was so distracting, some of the other people even noticed when I was changing and asked why I was \"having my ass flossed\" and it was super embaressing. I can feel it pretty much constantly, and it makes doing things like gym a nightmare. my coach has even commented on how much worse my positioning is when doing squats or sprints, but it isn't like I can tell him why. I've worn them the last nine days and by the time I get back from school my crack is slightly red. Because the material is so small and so cheap, it becomes saturated with sweat easily, which makes it incredibly itchy. I once even had to leave class to fix it. I have to bring one to change into after gym, and I only have three.\n\nHonestly the worst part is being around my boyfriend with it. He knows what happened, and everytime I make am awkward face when I sit down slowly I know he knows and i die of embaressment. I can't not wear underwear because I have too much discharge, and the g strings are all I have. Do you think my mom is taking it way too far or should i have known better than to wear my thong showing? Do you think having 'whale tail' is an issue in general?\n\n\nedit: to be clear wearing the g strings is my punishment, and i'm not allowed to wear any other underwear for another week or so at the least. \n\n\n",

            "selftext": "I work in a school age before and after school daycare program and I have one child who causes a lot of problems. She's a nine year old girl and she acts like she can do whatever she wants to do. \n\n\nShe spends too much time doing activities on her own and not playing with other children. There's one adorable little boy who can not get too close to her or she just has a fit. He takes the markers she's using so he can play too and it's so cute. \n\nShe demands to have a certain cup for her juice at snack time. Also at snack time, she says she wants more food, but we don't want her to become a little piggy. The children are allowed a couple carrots or maybe a small handful of crackers. \n\nShe has a toy that she always brings to daycare that no other child is allowed to touch. Once another child took it and tried to throw it in the trash to make her give it up. She had a huge fit and cried until she found it. I tried to tell her mother the toy can't come to daycare anymore, but she said it's her special toy. \n\n\nApparently she is Autistic, so me and my coworkers have made some rules for her to follow, but she whines and says she is never coming back when we make her follow them.\n\n\n\n1. She is not allowed to do any solo activities until she does at least one group activity.\n\n2. She may not bring her special toy outside of the classroom unless she is going home. I tried to ban the toy entirely but her mother threw too big of a fit.\n\n\n3. She refuses to let us call her by her real name and throws fits, so nobody is allowed to call her by any nicknames. She may not use them herself either.\n\n\n4. Because of the above rule, she is not allowed to sign birthday cards.\n\n\n5. She is required to go to the gym daily for active group games and social time.\n\n\n6. She can either have snack when she first comes in or not at all. \n\n\n7. After she finishes her snack she is not allowed to stay at the table or near it.\n\n\n8. She is not allowed to complain about how much she hates it there and how she wants to go home. She's there, so she has to deal. We tell her if she gets kicked out of the program her mom won't be able to go to work.\n",

I'm afraid I won't know how to spread my love around.

            "selftext": "I have a 13mo daughter. She\u2019s awesome, but I\u2019m struggling with the exhaustion, chaotic house, organising my life around her ever changing sleep schedule. The lack of time for myself and just having space to breathe and keep on top of the thousands of thoughts going through my head is a struggle for me. \nLogically, I would think things should improve once she sleeps through the night, is more consistent in her routine (she was doing this before, but is going through some phase at the moment). The messy house will probably always be an issue, but I can deal with that. Time for myself I imagine will increase as she gains independence and goes off to school. \nBUT my sleep deprived brain needs real life examples from parents who have made it through to the other side. What is life like over there? I know that older kids have demands as well but is it more balanced? Do you get time to be an adult again and have a life? \nI do make time to see friends and get time to myself but I look forward to a day where we can live harmoniously and she\u2019s not so demanding on my time and attention. She\u2019s very clingy at the moment and I can\u2019t leave her alone in her playroom for even a minute or else she screams. \nTIA",

So we (my husband and I) were discussing with her how we (and everyone else) would appreciate it if she would use her deodorant more consistently and bathe a little better when she showers. To back up my claim, I had her smell a sweater that smelled like armpits and she then told me that she couldn\u2019t smell anything and hasn\u2019t been able to do so in weeks. At first I was alarmed, scrambling to Google to do research on anosmia. Upon my research, I found that people who are diagnosed with anosmia also can\u2019t taste very well and anosmia usually happens at birth or due to head trauma. So I asked my child if she got hit in the head and she said no. Then I asked her if she could still taste things and she said yes. And then I asked her why she didn\u2019t tell her dad and I  about her sudden lack of smell when it happened and she said, \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was a big deal\u201d. \nSo I\u2019m not really sure what to do. I feel like she has lied to herself so much about it that she has made it a truth. Should I take her to a nose specialist? Or should I just ride this wave?\n\ntl:dr- my stepdaughter has convinced herself that she can\u2019t smell and I don\u2019t know what to do about it",

            "selftext": "Long story short: I'm a masters student in my early/mid twenties currently working part time as a hotel receptionist while studying.\n\nIn my job, I see a *lot* of overtired kids with disrupted routines having major meltdowns......and kids at 11am who look well rested having a meltdown because they can't have chicken nuggets RIGHT NOW or because they are being made to put their jacket on before going outside in -15 degree weather. \n\nIt happens more than once pretty much every shift, but at least once a week, a small child has a meltdown so long and loud that I actually have to pop painkillers because it gave me an actual headache. There are times I have felt like my head is going to split open from pain....and the headache was caused by an extended screaming meltdown from a child. \n\nIt happened again tonight. My colleague (young childless student as well) and I were talking afterwards and asked \"*how the hell do the parents handle living with this when just 10 minutes is enough to drive us crazy?*\". I always assumed I'd grow up and want to have kids because \"*it's what you do*\", but a few months at my job has made me honestly never want kids. Between the meltdowns, the crying, all the kids who get into trouble at the pool or cause damage somewhere that the parents have to pay for, and the sheer number of parents whose parting message to me is something \"*don't ever fucking have kids, trust me*\", and the number of Dads who wait until mom takes the kid away to deal with them and then make a comment about how they used to \"*love holidays, but not anymore....they're torture with kids*\" or they just look.....pained. Or they ask me \"*do you have kids*\" and when I say no, they say \"*good, keep it that way, trust me*\" while looking like they are being marched off to a concentration camp while walking over to their partner and offspring. \n\nSo. \n\nWe are genuinely curious here so using quiet time on the night shift to ask: how *do* you handle the crying from your babies and the tantrums/screaming from your toddlers. Like, do secretly hate listening to it as much as we do and grit your teeth because it is a phase that will pass and they'll grow out of it soon? Have you heard the crying so many times you become \"immune\" to it and don't really hear it? \n\nAnd how do you manage to enjoy holidays when it seems like so many parents (generally dads, but not always) confess they basically hate holidays now. What makes you keep taking them? What do you do to ensure they are still enjoyable? Did your lives really become that much less enjoyable after having kids? Do you regret it when they are being difficult. \n\nPlease don't take this question the wrong way. We're not trying to be those people who are like \"kids should never ever be in public\", but well, I don't think anyone can deny that listening to a scream its head off for 10 minutes is really annoying. But we only have to listen to it for a few minutes and then they go away. We're curious how the people who have to *always* listen to it manage to cope, and whether it sometimes (or often) makes you question your choice to have kids, the way it has made me question wanting them. \n\nHopefully this doesn't come out the wrong way :) \n",

We're among the last\n\nIf we do have a kid, we know the first year will be a \"hostage situation\", that the next couple of years will be \"95% grind, 5% joy\" for a while, but then they get to about 3 and head off to kindy a couple of days a week (we're not in the USA) and they go off to school and you start to get a lot more time back and they don't need to be literally spoonfed anymore and can brush their own teeth etc. \n\nSo I was wondering how parents of older kids who are out of the stage where their kid needs to be spoonfed/have their teeth brushed for them (but especially interested to hear from parents of kids 16+ who've 'done it all') feel, especially those who would have traded back for their old lives if they could have when their child was aged 1/3/5. \n\nDo you look back now and still say \"I wouldn't do it again\" or did your mind change somewhere along the way? \n\nNot looking to be swayed one way or another, just want to hear your honest answers. I don't have anyone to ask really - the people in our social circle have kids who are under 6, and we don't really have anyone older we could ask who'd be honest with us because...they are our parents/aunts/uncles/grandparents and won't come out and say they wouldn't have had *us* or our parents or cousins if they had their time over, even if they think it deep down.

I guess what made me go for it is the thought of no kids when I was in my sixties and that sounded worse than not having kids at all. So I just took the plunge. \n\nBut I am interested in hearing from people here who didn't want kids, or were undecided, and had kids anyway (maybe an unplanned pregnancy? Maybe a leap of faith?)

            "selftext": "If this pregnancy goes as hoped, my husband and I are expecting our first child in late July/early August.  We're pretty clueless about the usefulness and practicality of various baby-related items in practice, so please excuse me if my questions are dumb.\n\nWe live in NYC, don't own a car, and typically walk or take public transit rather than a taxi/car service.  However, my parents live in NYC as well and usually drive.  We currently live on the ground floor of a brownstone, though it's possible we may end up moving out and find ourselves in a walk-up depending on the rent situation.  Our primary grocery store is a block away and the pediatrician we're considering is about three blocks away.  If it matters, we're planning on having one more kid, most likely within 3-5 years.\n\nMy question specifically is regarding whether a stroller system (the kind with the infant car seat attached to it) is *really* necessary for someone without regular access to a car, and whether we can just get away with a baby carrier until the kid is old enough to ride in an umbrella stroller.  If my parents want to get a car seat and stroller system for use in their car(s), I'd leave that up to them.\n\nThe source of me questioning the necessity of a stroller is seeing parents struggling with bulky strollers in the subway and on buses and wondering if maybe it'd just be easier to have the kid strapped to our body.  Chances are if we go out with the baby, it would be both husband and me together.  If a stroller and the infant car seat are still good to have for getting around in our neighborhood, has anyone found navigating mass transit with baby in a carrier easier than dealing with an entire stroller?\n\nAlso, how long do your kids typically continue to use strollers?  My memory from toddler-hood is spotty as best, but I don't think my parents kept me or my sisters in a stroller past the age of 2 or 3.  I find it weird when I see a kid who could be 4 or older still sitting in a stroller and getting pushed around rather than being expected to walk on their own.",

What I'm about to say is going to sound very unpopular so please, please don't judge me because I'm in a pretty hopeless place and I'm reaching out for help. I'm hoping to get advice and maybe hope from parents that were in my shoes.\n\nBut I'm 13 weeks along and feel nothing for this child, just fear. So much fear. About how it's going to affect and slowly dissolve our marriage and sanity. How I can't do the things I enjoyed any more. All of the responsibilities I don't want. And that makes me not want the child.\n\nI was always on the fence about kids. I agreed to have one because I didn't know who would get our family farm when we die (I'm an only child). I also felt that something was missing and our lives were boring and needed some meaning. I look back on that now 13 weeks in and all I can think most days is \"You absolute idiot, should have signed the farm over to a charity and gotten some new hobbies\"\n\nEveryone... I don't even like kids. I don't like the screeching, tantrums, underdeveloped personalities.\n\nI'm self centered and all I want to do is sit on the ipad all day and watch movies in peace. And. Quiet. \n\nI feel trapped. It kills me seeing my grandma in tears at Christmas because she's so excited. I feel nothing and most days I just want to back out and stay in bed crying.\n\nBottom line is, I'm not sure if this is really me talking or if I have some sort of personality disorder or depression. I'm afraid I'm going to have the baby and I won't get attached. And that poor helpless child, who never asked for any of this, is going to have a mom that isn't crazy about them.\n\nI've been seeing a therapist but she thinks it's just nerves and gives me reasons why I should be excited and why it's going to be ok. I'm not sure I believe her.\n\nDid anyone else feel like this? Or not want a child, and end up loving it? I could really use some honesty right now. Thank you.",

            "selftext": "So my son is about two years and four months old. I have a lot of experience with children and I know meltdowns are normal. More recently over the past couple of weeks my son has meltdowns about pretty much everything. We are decently strict on him.  He knows the rules and like any two year old he just defies them. Over the last several days he\u2019s had one of these fits just about everyday. Yesterday we were in a store. I smacked his butt and he went to bed right when we got home. Today he is trying to open the front door so after telling him about 30 times not to do that I took him to his room, told him he needs to start listening and shut the door. Typically I just let him throw his fit until he\u2019s over it and go back in when I don\u2019t hear crying and he\u2019s willing to say sorry. He\u2019s in there kicking and screaming at the top of his lungs right now. Part of me wants to go in and bust him on the ass but I\u2019m not sure if that would be better in the long run. Should I allow him to just continue with this out of control tantrum? ",

The ONLY way he will fall asleep is with my boob in his mouth, or if his dad rocks him for 45minutes straight. We can't do it anymore. That would be fine, actually... but he wakes up EVERY 30/45 minutes and it's KILLING us. He has to be rocked, or fed to sleep again. We have co-slept since birth, but now he has to sleep in his crib as he is crawling off the bed. We spend a fortune on bedrails and it only stopped him for a week.\n\nWe have tried the pick up-put down method, sitting by him while he cries, singing, favourite toys... everything. He doesn't take a bottle or dummy (hates them) So please, no other suggestions. Please help us cope. \nWe need to know how to do this. We are so afraid to just leave him in his crib to cry, in case he knocks his head (he stands up and cries) We can't bare to sit and listen to him cry, it's fucking heartbreaking. Our baby boy sobs like we have abandoned him, but this will be good for him (and us!!!) He NEEDS a full nights rest. And, my god, so do we.\nWe have been doing this the past 2 weeks and nothing has changed. Our neighbors are complaining and we are about to be kicked out of our apartment (I know, fuck them - right?) but we seem like TERRIBLE parents with all the crying. People have come and asked us if they can help or if something is wrong - FUCK OFF.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with him, he is the HAPPIEST, brightest child knocking his milestones out of the park! He says words, knows what they mean, 6teeth, standing, almost using a few signs in sign language (teaching him so he can communicate) - like, he's SUPER normal, no problems not currently teething. But this kid can not fucking sleep.\n\nBabies sleep differently, so please guys, no hate or snarky comments, only respond if you have been through the same and have done this. It's literally our last resort. We NEVER wanted to do CIO but we have exhausted all other options. \n\n\nPlease help,\nTired, broken and defeated Mom&amp;Dad",

I had forgotten my phone at my friend's house, when we got back to his house, my mom had called his phone and yelled my ear off that she about not answering my phone and she had called the police to check on me and how she couldn't get a hold of my phone 3 times and my friend's phone neither until just then, well my friend's phone was off because it needed to charge. She texts me later telling me \"give me his mother's number\" When I did she responds \"got it, let's hope I don't have to use it\"\n\nI tried to have a conversation today with her about the matter and how i felt she went too far, my friends' and the one friend's parents all felt the same. I told her that she scared me to death about the police because i felt they could get her and I in major issues because of they could see it as a false call, she responds \"no they wouldn't do that\" and then she yells at me about how \"what if it was a job calling you? you just fucked yourself with getting hired\" or \"what if you grandfather past away?' and I told her, what if it was my phone was dead and charging and his was too, she responds \"Well if you don't like how I'm raising you or treating you and like how your friend's parents raised him and treat you, then pack up and live there\" I say to her that \"I am an adult mom\", my dad pipes up with \"Then act like it\" and my mother says \"well then, next time, if i hear from you then I hear from you, if I don't, then I don't care\" I say to her, well if that's how you feel, then she says \"I think last night should tell you that's not how I feel\" \n\nSo now, we've ended with that argument, I'm not sure what to do. Can't move out without some kind of consequence, i'm in between jobs right now and no car or license to drive. No where really to live that I can think of. My friends have all said too that the way things transpired with this event is rather bull, it was way to far. ",

            "selftext": "My husband had a pit bull when we met and I was scared to death of it after stories I\u2019ve heard about pit bull attacks.  His jaw is massive and I imagined him doing serious damage.  Over time I began to love him and when I moved in he was part of my family. We had discussions many times about my concerns about the pit bull being around any children we might have.  My husband seemed to think there was nothing to worry about.  He said they used to be used to babysit children. \n\nThe pit bull ran off one time when my husband was at the door and fought with the neighbors German Shepherd.  Both were injured.  Then a couple months later he bit the ear off the dog of my husband\u2019s friend.  A year later he got out when my sister-in-law insisted on taking him for the day (she loves dogs) and left the back door open.  He severely injured a small dog.  Animal control was involved that time and we had to pay a fine and ten thousand dollars in restitution.  I secretly hoped animal control would keep the dog, but I was afraid to tell my husband.  A few years later he got out when he was home with my husband and killed a neighbor\u2019s chihuahua.  The neighbor didn\u2019t call animal control, and we paid vet bills and some extra.  My husband sat down with them and apologized and they were forgiving.  On top of all this, the dog has killed a few possums and stray cats.\n\nToday he got out again when a delivery man didn\u2019t shut our front door all the way.  God, how I weigh I had checked the door.  He attacked another neighbor\u2019s dog.  (We have moved to a new neighborhood recently.) The dog is injured.  I don\u2019t know how severely.  I hope to god it\u2019s okay.  Animal control took our pit bull.  I want them to keep him.  If my husband knew, he would be angry with me.  I want to call animal control and tell them to keep him.  But I think my husband might divorce me, he loves the dog so much. \n\nLately the dog has been growling when my toddler comes near.  Not every time, and not viciously, but it scares me a lot.  I want that dog gone.  What do I do?",

My little dude is a decent sleeper IF and only IF you have him in your lap/arms. He did fine in the hospital in their bassinet but ours he will not sleep in for long. Has anyone had success transitioning a child to getting used to the bassinet/crib at this age? Or is it not worth my it?\n\nHe will fall asleep in around 10 minutes or less if we are swaying with him while he is swaddled and we have an oscillating fan white noise going. The plan so far has been one of us stays up with him and chills on the couch for the 2-3 hours of sleeping while the other sleeps as well. This of course seems very non sustainable. If there were any way to get him used to the bassinet, then we would be able to get more done during the day and not be such slaves to the couch. Not to mention it would really help my wife to get some more sleep. \n\nMany people have suggested the swing or the bouncer but he doesn't seem to like them. He has a minute or two of \"where am I now\" looks, then loud crying. \n\n\nIf you have any tips or need more info for tips I would really appreciate it!",

            "selftext": "I have two nieces who I love very much. Being an aunt is honestly one of my favorite roles and I deeply care about the well-being of my nieces. \n\nMy sister is a remarried divorc\u00e9 with two kids. One kid by her ex-husband and one kid by her current husband.  The older one, \"Nanie\"  by her ex-hubby is 7 years old and the second child, \"Mia\" with new hubby is 2 years old.  \n\nNanie's dad moved away after the divorce. He visits once a month and she goes to his place on school holidays.  His family also lives an hour away and she sees them during the holidays.  As a result, Nanie's dad isn't too involved in her life and neither is his family.  \nMia's dad is my sister's new husband, lives with them, his family lives nearby. (This will be relevant below)\n\nMy mom and I have always had a special connection with Nanie. We pick her up one to two weekends a month and she spends the weekends with us.  This year my mom is the one who paid for her school uniforms. When we can, my mom and I usually drive to take Nanie to school in the morning and sometimes pick her up from school in the afternoon.  We yearly throw birthday parties for Nanie and often buy her presents for her birthday and Christmas. \nWe call to speak to her usually either every day or every other day.\n\nMy sister has recently started a quarrel with me and my mom saying we favor Nanie over Mia. It started 2 months ago when I texted my sister to tell Nanie that \"I loved her so much and missed her.\" And my sister said \"why didn't I send the same message for Mia?\" \n\nIt was Mia's birthday about a month ago, and my sister threw her a party which I attended but my mom did not. Nanie's birthday is next week and my mom and I are taking Nanie to a restaurant to celebrate and plan on surprising her with the dream kitchen that she's been asking us for the last something months. Of course, instead of being happy that we are taking the time to celebrate her daughter's birthday, my sister is complaining that we didn't get Mia a present and didn't plan a separate celebration for her like we are doing for Nanie.  I told her I  believe Mia has a father and an entire extended family who can buy her presents and plan celebrations for her. \n\nI also know she's been complaining to my uncle that we only pick up Nanie to spend the weekend with us and not Mia. (She did not tell us this directly).  Mia's dad takes her to spend the weekend with her grandparents all the time, so we need to give Nanie that experience too. \n\n\nI love both my nieces. I spend time with Mia when I visit my sister's house.  But I have a stronger affinity for Nanie because Nanie's dad isn't really in her life.  Mia has a dad who lives with her and an extended family nearby. She gets tons of experiences and support by virtue of having an active rathe and extended family. Nanie does not.  Nanie needs us more, and that's why we give her the extra love and attention. She needs it more. \n\nI don't feel that it is wrong that we favor her.  I think my sister is overreacting. ",

            "selftext": "TLDR; My dad found weed in the backyard and wont let me see my best friends anymore. Just read the last paragraph if you cant be bothered with the rest\n\nI'll preface this by saying I live with my dad and my mom is not in the picture.\n\nSo a couple weeks ago i turned 16. My dad let me have a party so I had some friends over. It was late and everyone left except for my really close friends so they decided it was a good time to smoke some pot. I'm not really a big fan of weed but it was my 16th birthday so i decided what the hell might as well celebrate. So we left smoked and came back everything was fine. My friends left and i helped my dad clean up the backyard from the party. We were all done and he goes into the corner and somehow finds 2 little tiny pieces of weed and he starts yelling at me about bringing drugs into the house and blah blah blah. He asked me who brought it and im honest with my dad (which i now see is a mistake) so i told him it was  my best friends boyfriend (We'll call him Carl). Nothing really came of it at the time but fast forward 2 weeks to today and i asked if i could go to my best friends house (We'll call her Lilly). He asked if Lilly was dating Carl and I was honest with him (another mistake) and told him yes. He then told me im forbidden from ever going to Lillys house ever again and then he threw in some of my other friends names that he suspects were involved.\n\nNow all of you were teenagers at one point so you know that there is NOTHING more important to a teenager than their friends. I told him you cant keep a kid from seeing their friends especially their best friends but he just responded with that stupid thing parents say \"you should have thought about that before you brought drugs in this house\" even though its pretty well known kids dont think about anything before they do it. Kids are gonna do what they want to do and by trying to keep me from seeing my friends hes just going to create a rebellious teenager. Im a pretty good kid I pass all my classes I stay out of trouble I help around the house I have a job but hes treating me like im some kind of degenerate with a bunch of druggy friends. How do I make him see that by not letting me see my friends hes teaching me that in the future i should just lie to him instead of tell the  truth because the truth means hes just gonna take away my friends? Or am I totally wrong here? I get im going to be punished for using drugs I totally understand that part and if he just grounded me or took my phone or something I wouldnt be on reddit asking what to do but I think hes being way unreasonable trying to control who I hang out with. Teens will be teens everyone smokes weed when theyre young. And what makes it really confusing for me is he smoked A LOT of weed when he was younger. I think he was older than me when he had his weed phase but still he should be able to know well enough that weed isnt some hard drug thats gonna put me on the streets. Anyway what can I do to make him see that trying to keep me from my friends is unreasonable because kids are gonna do what they want anyway, unfair because I was totally honest with him and hes just punishing my honesty when i could have easily said it was someone elses, and just a bad idea because hes going to cause much worse rebellious behavior?",

We do own our house (so we do not have a mortgage) and are (mostly) monetarily stable.  If we were to get pregnant as soon as we start trying, baby would be born when we are age 24. I think this is the perfect age, however the husband would prefer 25 or 26. Obviously we'll have to talk about it and compromise, but I wanted to hear from some parents how old they were and if you would do it any differently!",

My parents are pretty old fashioned, and really strict. \n\nOn Saturday night I had a sleepover with my best friend, and we snuck out (my dad doesn't know, yet) and went to a X-rated movie. Afterwards we hung out with some guys, they were older than us, and we went out for dinner. While we were at dinner we bumped into my big brother [28M]. He was so mad, because he knew I wasn't supposed to be there, and he was even madder by the fact that I was with a guy. He made some threats to the guys, and forced me and my friend to leave with him. I was so embarrassed, and I'm really mad with him. I feel like I'm old enough to make these decisions for myself. \n\nMy brother dropped my friend at home, and made me stay at his apartment. He said I have until Thursday to come clean to my parents or else he will tell them. He told my other brother [25M] and sister [26F], and they agree.\n\nThey are throwing me to the wolves, and breaking our sibling no snitching code. Normally they get me OUT of trouble. None of them have even shown me a bit of sympathy. \n\nI don't want to tell my mom and dad, I don't want them to know. I'm going to be in huge trouble. I know I'll get a spanking for this, and probably will be grounded for forever. \n\nI think I'm old enough to be able to go out, and choose who I hang out with. And I'm too old for a spanking, but I know my siblings got spanked until they were older. \n\nHow do I convince my parents I'm old enough? And how can I get out of this mess! \n\nNB: My mom and dad are in no way abusive. They are strict but fair, so please don't throw flames on my parents. ",

We both disagree with each other. I argue that I know plenty of men who are not circumcised and are happy with their penis. There is a slight increase risk of infection, but it's so small, I don't feel it's necessary to base a circumcision off of hygiene reasons. Now, I've presented my argument to him and he agrees with my points, however, he is circumcised and wants his potential son to look like him. So his argument is solely based off looks and how he wants to have the same penis look. I feel extremely torn about this; I want to respect his decision to have his son look like him, however, I want to respect my child. I believe in children's rights and who am I to alter his body for non-medical reasons? I have researched both arguments for and against circumcision and, if there is no medical reason, there is not real reason to do the operation. My husband is very understanding about my stance and agrees that if I REALLY don't want to move forward with the procedure, he will drop the subject. However, he is disappointed and would love to have his son look like him. If anyone can give some insight on this subject, it would be much appreciated. I only have friends and family to speak to and I've heard a lot of false facts regarding hygiene and I feel they are not a reliable source to base my decision off of. ",

It doesn't hurt to be prepared, right?\n\nBut, I am curious about the nitty gritty on what stuff people added to their lists, but used once and never again. Or stuff that you never really found a purpose for. Or stuff that seemed logical when you added it, but then left you scratching your head about \"why exactly did I think this would be useful?\"\n\nDiscussions in real life have suggested a bottle sterilizer (probably something we will use since we only run our dishwasher once every week or two). Other folks mentioned diaper genies are a waste. What other things have you found are are kind of useless over the long run?\n\nAny help is appreciated, thank you!",

            "selftext": "OK this question is probably really dumb but something I have been overthinking. \n\nI am a childless housewife and often go to the supermarket during the day at the same time as a lot of stay at home moms. It happens fairly often that they have a bored small child in the cart that is just staring at me. They are very cute and I think perhaps by keeping them entertained while mom is buying groceries that I am doing something nice for both kid and mom? So I used to make random happy/excited faces and the kid would be non verbal and just smile back. I wouldn't touch them or talk to them, just make miscellaneous happy faces. \n\nBut then on social media I am picking up on the fact that parents aren't too keen on random people interacting with their kids. Like touching their newborns or whatever. Which is totally understandable because germs. There seems to be a stigma with random people interacting with kids - again understandable strangers are weird. So at the supermarket I started avoiding eye contact with the kids and looking on my phone to play it safe. \n\nI'm a petite 4'10\" woman in my 20s if this helps with how creepy of a stranger I am. I guess it might be different if a huge dude or whatever did this? Maybe? \n\nAnyway what do you think? Random people smiling at your kid nice or creepy? I am never around kids or parents so this might be a very stupid question. ",

            "selftext": "*Tl;dr: Adopted boy I tutor did a family trees project of adoptive family's heritage, teacher failed him citing that he doesn't technically \"share any of their roots\". Parents and child are devastated but it's a private school and he's a on financial aid, so they're hesitant to confront the teacher. What now? *\n\nI tutor an eleven year old boy, let's call him \"Murphy\", and he just had a typical \"family tree\" class project. \n\nWe worked on it together our entire session last week, and he got really into it making an elaborate poster board with pipe cleaner branches, that he was very proud of. And his teacher gave the project a failing grade. Why? \n\nMurphy is adopted and he did his family tree based off his adoptive family. \n\nHe is African American and his parents are Sephardic Orthodox Jewish people, so I thought maybe the teacher was confused, but even after he explained she insisted. I suspect some racism may be at play. \n\nHe was adopted from a West African refugee camp when he was no more than six months old and has no memory of any life other than the one he lives in America, he's obviously been raised in their faith and has a very standard American name. \n\nMurphy is not a shy kid, so as I understand it, he told his teacher he was raised by his adoptive family his whole life, and adheres to their culture and values, so not only would it not make sense with the purpose of the project, but it would also be next to impossible as he doesn't even have an original birth certificate from Africa. \n\nThen this woman has the nerve to tell this eleven year old boy that he isn't \"technically\" Jewish because his birth mother was most likely not Jewish, and apparently in the Jewish faith your blood mother has to be Jewish for you to be considered a part of the religion. \n\nBeing adopted is of course a tender and often confusing subject for a pre-teen, and he was understandably shaken by this whole incident. \n\nI wanted to storm into his classroom and give the teacher a talking to myself, but it's only his second year at an elite private school on a hefty scholarship, and his parents are fuming but also hesitant to make waves. \n\nIt's also a poignant subject as his older brother did a similar project when he was Murphy's age, and Murphy used a lot of his research materials and genealogical records from his adoptive grandfather. So it creates a feeling of divide for Murphy between him and his brother. \n\nAs a retired teacher and foster mother myself I feel his teacher was totally out of line and that this is a critical juncture for his parents to reassure him of his belonging to the family. I encouraged them to schedule an in person meeting to sort this out right away, but because of the aforementioned financial aid, they're really unsure. \n\nWould you agree, do you have any ideas as to how I could convince them to go in, if you don't agree how do you think I should advise them, and are there any active  subreddits for adopted children or parents where I could cross post? \n\nThanks. \n\nUPDATE: They just had a meeting with his teacher and it looks as though he'll be switched to a different class for the remainder of the term. His parents are also going to follow up with higher up administrators because the teacher continued to voice this ludicrous opinion that they are somehow not Murphy's \"real\" family. She sounds like she has a screw loose and I'm glad he'll be in a different class (and so is he, despite being a little sad about missing his friends.) ",

            "selftext": "This is gonna be long so bear with me...\n\nMy girlfriends nephew is 5 now. His parents do not give him much attention and when they do they NEVER focus on learning. He doesn't know any letters past ABC and cannot count to 3. What's really concerning me is that he seems to be unable to learn. My girlfriend and I sat down with him a few weeks back and tried to teach him to count to 5. Now I know that when kids don't want to learn and don't pay attention it can be hard for them to learn. This wasn't that \"I'm answering but really just saying stuff hoping it will be over soon\" kind of thing. We offered to get him a toy of he could do it. He was trying. After about 20 minutes I said something along the lines of \"Noah, you are making this harder than it needs to be. If I named 5 toys, you can say those 5 toys right back to me. Truck, Dino, super man, etc\" my point being that even if he couldn't remember it 10 minutes from then, he should have no problem reciting a list of 5 of anything right after I just said it to him. I'm at a loss here. Finally after about 30 minutes he could do it. But he'd only get it every few tries. He'd often mix up the numbers or throw in a number like 11 randomly. When he got a little better we drove 5 minutes to Tue store and by then he couldn't do it anymore. I'm really worries about him.\n\nAnother problem is his level of emotional immaturity. Just this morning he started crying like crazy to the point that he couldn't talk. When he finally could calm down he told me the issue was he couldn't get a flashlight to turn off. I said \"OK but why did you get so upset? Why didn't you just come calmly tell me what the problem was so I could help you?\" He cries over everything and doesn't know how to manage his emotions. Is any of this normal for a 5 year old?\n\nOne more issue. His dad constantly puts him down and calls him a sissy and a girl and a crybaby. I have heard him on multiple occasions say that he \"hates himself\" and \"wants to die.\" His dad said \"boy are we gonna have to take you to a crazy person doctor?\" (Again shaming him) the wanting to die and hating himself is a sign of low self esteem due to his father IMO.\n\nDoes anyone have thoughts on any of this? Thanks a lot. ",

            "selftext": "I'm 25F, my husband is 35M, and we have been together for 4 1/2 years (married for one year).\n\nWe are planning to have kids sometime in the next 5-7 years. However I'm not sure about the whole thing. For one thing I am a hypochondriac and I am terrified of dying from complications of pregnancy/childbirth. We have even discussed having a surrogate do the pregnancy because of my anxiety. I also have a huge fear of getting postpartum depression or psychosis and maybe even murdering my baby in a Andrea Yates-like psychotic episode. In fact I am afraid to be alone with my baby at all and would like to find some way to avoid being alone with the baby in the first year of life.\n\nThen even after the kids are born, I have been reading articles online about parenting and it seems like it's really easy to mess it up. There are so many different completely contradictory parenting styles and they all have these dire warnings that if you do anything even slightly wrong by mistake, your kid will end up with a personality disorder. I don't know anything about parenting. Sure there are articles and books but that's not really comparable to the real thing. I have never even babysat before. I don't know how people figure out how to parent. Maybe they have relatives to help them out, but I don't.\n\nThis may sound irrational, but one of my fears is being murdered by my own kid, or at least my kid hating me. I'm into true crime stuff and there are always stories of kids murdering their parents (Kip Kinkel, Adam Lanza, Tylar Witt, just to name a few), and usually in those cases the parents get victim blamed and people say that they brought it on themselves by not parenting the kid properly.\n\nAdditionally, at age 25 my career has not really gotten off the ground, and I am concerned that I will have no hopes for a career if I have to take years and years off work for pregnancy and childcare. Maybe I will feel differently about it when I have kids, but the tasks of childcare seem highly unpleasant to me, mind-numbing, as well as socially isolating. I'm not really close to anyone who has kids and we don't have any relatives who would be able to help out either. I would feel guilty about putting my kid in childcare before age two (unless the research says it won't give them a personality disorder to do that), and ideally I would like in-home childcare as a backup (like a nanny to tell me what to do to take care of the kid and be there in case of postpartum psychosis, panic attacks, etc.) but there is a question about affordability at that point of course. My husband has said he will try to have a work-from-home job by that point (he works in an industry where this is common) but I am not confident about that.\n\nMy husband meanwhile has always wanted kids and is really adamant about having kids. He thinks that everything will turn out fine. But he also doesn't seem to have done any research on what parenting will actually entail. Kids seem like they are far off in the distant future for him, even though it's not actually going to be that far away. And his attitude also does not seem like someone who is ready to be a parent. He can barely even wash the dishes properly and is constantly leaving messes. I don't want to seem mean to him, but if he can't even perform basic household tasks, will he be able to do the delicate work of raising a child?\n\nSo getting to the issue: a couple of months ago my husband insisted on adopting his MIL's pet conure when she was hospitalized. This parrot is pretty emotionally disturbed and always has been from the day they got it, always biting (other people and itself) and screaming at ear-splitting levels, and often doesn't even want to spend time with us. I really was not a fan of adopting this bird. Maybe if it was a less psycho bird, or even just a less loud bird (this type of bird is not recommended for apartments due to its volume level and we live in an apartment). We were also planning to get a pair of cats or small dogs in the future and now we can't. Even his MOM said that it would be more practical to just give her away to a bird sanctuary, and that was her family pet for 11 years. But he insisted on it, saying she was part of the family. I told him that we can keep her as long as a) he does 100% of the work taking care of her, since she's not my pet, she's his pet, and b) he did something to try to train her to be less psycho and easier to live with.\n\nWell it's 2 1/2 months later and he is not doing either of those things. Everything I have read says that this type of bird needs AT LEAST 60-90 minutes of sustained interaction per day. He barely gives her 15 minutes of sustained interaction per day. He thinks that changing her food, water, and cage paper, and then letting her out of the cage and letting her choose to come near her or not while he plays video games on his computer, counts as sustained interaction. He also has done nothing to train her to be a more agreeable pet. Meanwhile I am currently at home all day and I'm the one who has to constantly deal with this bird screaming because she wants attention that he is supposed to give her. I give her some attention too, but she doesn't even like me (she attacks whenever I come within two feet of her cage, and runs back into her cage if she is out and I come near her).\n\nTonight I was reading some stuff about childcare randomly and getting anxious about how scary it will be to be a parent. I went into the living room and saw my husband fast asleep on the couch, the lights on, and the bird in her cage completely uncovered. This was at 2 AM and she is supposed to go to bed at like 10 or 11 PM. He had gotten home late today after a work function, so I had originally had her cage covered, but I uncovered her when he came home so she could see that he got home (she has abandonment issues after my FIL died and my MIL was hospitalized, plus she was a rescue bird). Then we watched some TV, I left the room afterwards while he was lying on the couch and asked him to please cover her before he went to bed. He said \"I'm going to get up in a minute and do it.\" If I had not gone into the room she would have been uncovered all night with the lights on, and she was even trying to sleep with the lights on!\n\nWhen I saw this, I asked him how he thinks he is going to take care of a kid if he can't even take care of his parrot. I told him that if he can't give her proper care, including 60-90 minutes of interaction per day, that we should give her to a sanctuary that would be able to do so, and also that he wasn't ready to have the responsibility of a kid if he couldn't even take care of a pet. He started bitching at me for \"giving him an ultimatum\" and basically discounted everything I said since he considered it unfair to get an \"ultimatum\" from me. Then he also bizarrely started insisting that he does spend an hour interacting with her per day even though that is factually not true and told me that \"you just choose not to see it\" (I am right there, I can see what he does in the evenings). But what else am I supposed to do in that instance? I mean don't you agree that this sets a bad precedent for what is to come?\n\nA conure isn't even as much work as a kid and he can't even fulfill that duty. I don't even want this parrot at all and yet I actually do more work taking care of her than he does (between dealing with her screaming fits, giving her attention since he doesn't, changing her food/water/paper and covering her on the days when he gets home late, and cleaning up the bits of food and poop she leaves everywhere). There's no indication that it won't be exactly the same when we have kids. And since he wants kids more than I do, I think that he should be putting in even more effort taking care of them and preparing for them than I will. I see no indication that this will happen. This is a guy so averse to doing anything household-related that he will tell me to make Easy Mac for him instead of doing it himself because he supposedly \"doesn't know how\"!\n\nSo anyway, I would like some advice from parents on this situation, whether it will actually be as scary and life-encompassing as I think to be pregnant and raise kids, and what the deal is with my husband and whether he's in the wrong or not.\n\n**NOTE: And if you're just going to leave a dismissive comment like \"get help\" or \"don't have kids\" or \"you are weird/creepy\" without any more substantiative discussion of what I have written about...don't bother.**",

            "selftext": "I've posted to another forum online and decided to post here too. My son is 5 and is incredibly abusive toward me (his mother). He's very well behaved at school and is a high achiever and doesn't act out there. Sometimes he will try and be controlling with my parents but is not violent or anything with them. In general he will try to argue with me any chance he gets, more than your usual kid I think. \n\nI am firm and consistent with rules, structure and saying no but do not go overboard and am not overly strict or anything. I know I'm not perfect- no parent is but I can't think of or see what I'm doing that would be causing this behaviour. \n\nI've had trouble finding diverse resources for advice. Many assume you're an abusive parent/in an abusive home or it's the same kind of advice which I have tried. He is on his best behaviour in front of others but at home with me he will yell, throw/break things and physically abuse me. I have actively tried to raise him in a way that avoids this behaviour and I don't smack him or abuse him in any way. He is not around abusive people or households at all. \n\nIt only started about a year ago and was not as bad as it is now and I had it under control. I assumed it was a phase and he was back to being how he used to be. Then it started again and nothing I try works. I've tried so many different approaches that I am out of ideas and google hasn't helped (not that it's meant to be a parenting tool). Anything I try will start to work and then he will completely revert to being worse than he was to begin for a bit. He is very well behaved in front of others it's just when he is alone with me he isn't. Examples of what he does is throw and break furniture and belongings. He has tried countless times to hit me with and throw furniture at me. He hits, punches; kicks; bites, etc. He will completely trash the house by tipping rubbish out, and whatever else will make mess. This week he's been the worst he's ever been. Once this week he came up to me and peed on the floor and another time this week he smeared some faeces (it was a tiny amount thankfully). He said he did it so I have to clean it up. When I try to make him clean up any kind of mess that he makes, he makes more. Punishments/discipline for his behaviours haven't worked and a lot of the time make it worse. \n\nA disturbing thing that happened about 1.5 months ago was he came up behind me while I was working and stabbed me in the shoulder with a pen and said \"Great now you can die\". If I hurt myself sometimes he will say a sarcastic 'haha' but lately he has actually found it amusing, like this week when I trod on a shard of glass.\n\n I really don't know what else to do or know of anything that I haven't already tried. I don't know if this is a phase as he never went through the 'terrible twos'. But I also don't know if this means he has something worse going on. I'm a single parent, he's an only child so I have no one to compare this to.",

            "selftext": "It\u2019s a long story that I\u2019ve included below if you\u2019re at all interested. But you\u2019ll be seeing me here frequently as I know absolutely nothing about children and in a few days will have a five month old, four year old, and six year old moving in. Parents, I have so many questions, but I\u2019m going to start with my most pressing three. \n\n-Morning routine? \n\nI\u2019ve heard the clich\u00e9 that it always takes longer to leave the house with kids, but I don\u2019t know how much longer. The school is ten minutes away, we\u2019ll drive them there. Right now we\u2019re planning to leave an hour and a half to wake up and leave. Is that long enough? There\u2019s making their beds, brushing teeth, getting dressed, and eating breakfast. Does getting the kids out of the house include anything else I\u2019m leaving out? \n\n-Decorating their room?\n\nWe want them to feel welcomed when they arrive and not feel like they\u2019re in a cold empty guest room (which is exactly what it is right now). But we also don\u2019t want to be presumptuous and put up decorations they aren\u2019t fond of. (I haven\u2019t spoken to the kids in over a year).  So should  we decorate it, and if so, what do kids like? \n\n-Toys? \n\nTo our knowledge the kids don\u2019t have any. They were living with their grandmother in what the social worker has described as \"near squalor\". The woman was barely able to care for herself let alone three kids. We want to be sure they come home to a house full of toys, but nothing more extravagant than the average kid. How many toys does the average kid have? What kind of toys would they like to play with? Neighbors have already brought over some stuffed animals and puzzles, and I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re appropriate for kids this young but someone also gave us over 100 Yu-Gi-O cards.\n\n\nEXTRA INFORMATION\n\nTo summarize how I got here without too much extraneous detail \u2013 I come from a low income background, didn\u2019t grow up in the best of neighborhoods, as such it wasn\u2019t uncommon for kids to fall into the world of drugs. I coped by throwing myself into books, my brother went a different way. He struggles with addiction and has three children, all by the same woman. \n\nHe\u2019s been in and out of prison for a few years and as of recently he\u2019ll be there a few more. Our cousin, a lawyer, swept in at the eleventh hour and got the mother (couch surfer with addiction issues and while I have no concrete proof, is almost certainly a prostitute) to terminate her parental rights. \n\nThe kids had been living with their maternal grandmother for the last two years, who\u2019s just been diagnosed with dementia and will have to move to a senior citizens facility. \n\nShe\u2019s a nightmare for other reasons irrelevant here, and the kids have definitely suffered for it. (I was estranged from their grandmother after my first bid for custody. I\u2019d come over and they\u2019d be eating cocoa puffs for dinner, the five year old would walk to school alone right by a busy roadway, etc.) Their grandmother moved away and didn\u2019t tell me her address, disconnected her cellphone number, that was about a year ago. \n\nToday I got the call that she\u2019d been arrested last night for driving without a license, and was evaluated at the emergency room where she was found to have pretty advanced dementia. They were going to make the children wards of the state when my name came up at the last minute (we have different last names as I\u2019m married now). \n\nBureaucratic red tape and the fact that they\u2019re residents of a different state than I am almost dictated that they\u2019d have to remain in state care until I underwent an inspection by social services, but an excellent lawyer has cut that time down to two days before I can bring the kids home. I\u2019m going to the courthouse to start the paperwork today. \n\nI include these details because you\u2019ll likely be seeing a lot of me on here. I know absolutely nothing about kids. I wasn\u2019t even sure I was going to have kids, and if I was it at least five years down the road. \n\nI\u2019m blessed to have money saved and a house with enough space, for now. So my only concern is being the best surrogate parent to these kids I can be.\n\n\n",

            "selftext": "Tl;dr: My son is spanked and doesn't seem psychologically damaged or ultimately upset by it. Am I missing something, or is he an exception to all the research out there about corporal punishment? \n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nI live on a reclusive tropical island where physical discipline is the norm. \n\nI can give more background if you need it, but essentially here's the facts leading up to now. \n\n-Met my husband in high school, we began dating, we got pregnant (I was 16, he was 18). He was born on the island,  raised in the US but at 13 his parents moved back to the island and enrolled him in boarding school. \n\n-My parents were ashamed and wanted me to give the baby up for adoption (they've never admitted it but I maintain this has a lot to do with my then bf now husband's brown skin.) \n\n-His family was overjoyed (starting a family younger is more common on the island) and offered him a place in the family business if we moved here. I wasn't wild about it but we were financially destitute and had no other choice. \n\n-We moved here, he works in his family store, I got an online college degree and mainly do freelance editing, and we have a great life. \n\nThere are a few *major* cultural differences. The main being that spanking is the go-to method of discipline for most all children. \n\nI was raised in a household where putting your hands on anybody for any reason was unacceptable. My parents/extended family would never think to lay a hand on us. \n\nI learned about this in my third trimester when (let's call my husband \"D\") suggested we talk about our plans for discipline to be sure we were on the same page. He was stunned when he learned I was so opposed to corporal punishment of any kind, and I was blown away to know it had been occurring under my nose this entire time. I knew it happened sometimes but I hadn't realized how prevalent it was here. \n\nLong story short, I told D I was completely against it. He said he understood and while he didn't agree with my viewpoint, would support my decision, but that his extended family (particularly his parents) wouldn't. \n\nOur only option was to move off the island. That was majorly risky for us financially, and I didn't feel good about separating my husband and my unborn son from their otherwise loving extended family. But I wasn't going to budge. D was already looking for jobs elsewhere and we'd found a good lead on an apartment. My mind was changed based on a few things, that are irrelevant here. But ultimately we stayed. \n\nSo I'll gloss over the middle part of deliberating and bullet the progression. \n\n-I agree to stay and have K be raised in the traditional way, but I reserve the right to intervene at any point, and if it becomes too extreme D's agreed to move without resisting. \n\n-K is born, I'm introduced to the subtleties of discipline within the family. (While the child is young, the mother and female family members administer the majority of the discipline because it's more comforting and less intimidating for the child. As the child ages the parent of their gender takes sole responsibility for the discipline, with extended family involvement becoming less common.) \n\n-K is 4 when he's first really spanked. It consists of removing him from the situation, explaining what he did wrong in kid friendly language, and then giving 3-5 firm smacks over the knee to his bare bottom. \n\n-K turns 6, it's a 60-90 second bare bottom spanking, preceded by discussing the behavior and what he can do in the future to stop the behavior before it begins, and what he can do afterwards to make up with those he hurt. \n\n-K turns 7, he either receives the above, or he can be spanked on his calves with a tree limb similar to a willow switch. It actually hurts less than an otk spanking but is taken more seriously because there's an implement involved. \n\n-K is 8, bare bottom spanking for 3-5 minutes, switch when extended family does it. In extreme circumstances, bare bottom with the flat side of a hairbrush, for when a regular punishment isn't enough. (The first one he received was for sneaking off alone to swim in the deep water when we expressly forbade it. He could have drowned.) \n\n-K is somewhere between 9-10, D takes over the discipline. Mainly a paddling with the kind of paddle you'd find in an American school in the south. No set #, he gages by K's body language and response. A switching when the transgression isn't serious enough to call for a paddling, or on the rare occasion an extended family member administers. \n\n-10-11, a belt is used in extreme circumstances. Mainly just the paddle. Sometimes a switch. \n\n-It'll stay that way, the duration and intensity of the punishments increasing as he ages, until about 16/17, when you're more or less an adult here.  \n\n(This is the standard for all the kids in the family and not much different from the standard on the island.) \n\nEvery spanking done in total privacy, and as soon after the behavior as we can manage. We always take a moment to ourselves beforehand to make sure we're totally calm before we go in and start with him. \n\nIt is preceded by a discussion about why he's being punished, what he did, and why it was wrong. It's not a lecture, he does more of the talking than we do. It's usually one on one with whoever will be punishing him. \n\nWe always give him a chance to explain his reasoning. If he thinks he doesn't deserve to be punished, we talk it through with him until he's convinced what he did deserves punishment, or until we see where we're misunderstanding his actions. (I'd say 95% of the time he realizes he was wrong, but 5% of the time the punishment is either modified or not gone through with at all, because we didn't fully understand the situation.) He almost never contests, though. \n\nEven when he was young he didn't fight us on receiving the punishment. When we said \"Alright, K. We need to go speak in private for a moment.\" He knew what that meant but he always came willingly. \n\nWe never *ever* hit him if he hasn't fully consented first. We talk about exactly what we're going to do, make sure we've answered all his questions, and then follow through when he's ready. If he doesn't submit voluntarily we won't force him, or coerce him, we both agree that's abuse. \n\n(e.g., Once when K was 7 he stole some fruit from a neighbor's garden and he was caught. The neighbor brought him back to us. K didn't understand why he was in trouble because the garden was so big our neighbor never would have noticed anything missing if he hadn't caught K in the act. So it took almost an hour of explaining the immorality of taking something you didn't earn, but he understood it by the end and even suggested he go apologize to the neighbor before I could suggest it.) \n\nThere's a rule that after the punishment is carried out, he's got a clean slate and all is forgiven. \n\nAnd, this is the most important one, he's allowed to opt out of a physical punishment *any time*, no questions asked. He's only ever done that twice, and he hated it ten times as much as a spanking. He was faced with a regular bare bottom spanking, he was 7, and he had always known he had the option to have a different punishment, so he finally chose it. So instead we grounded him for three days (no electronics, no visitors, go to school and come right back home). By day two he was *begging* us to spank him, but he knew once he picked a punishment he had to see it through. \n\nThe funny thing is, he repeated the behavior we grounded him for less than a week later. \n\nK is 12 now. After reading so many studies about the detrimental effects of corporal punishment, I'm worried I may have been making a huge mistake. \n\nBut I'm torn, for two reasons. The first being, after he's spanked for something, he usually doesn't repeat the behavior. I worried at first that this was out of fear, not actual remorse for his actions. (My friends back in the US said he wasn't behaving badly because he didn't want a spanking, not because he actually wanted to do right.) \n\nBut I asked him when he was 7, \"Why don't you call your cousins names?\" (He'd just been disciplined a couple weeks ago for teasing his cousins.) And K said \"Because it makes them feel bad and it's not nice to use mean words with people. It won't fix your problem it'll just make you feel even worse than you did already.\" He obviously understood why it was wrong. He almost never teased his cousins anymore after that incident, either. \n\nI watched for the classic signs (he doesn't try to hide things from us if he gets in trouble. If a teacher sends a note home, for example, he doesn't wait to give it to us.) He doesn't flinch when I reach for him, he doesn't have a visceral reaction to his father putting a belt on or taking it off. He's not afraid of us, he has a better relationship with his father than I ever did with mine, and my parents wouldn't have hit me if their life depended on it. We hug him, when he was younger we'd carry him, he doesn't have a bad reaction to us touching him and doesn't hesitate to be affectionate with us. \n\nI'm at a loss. \n\nEverything I read says he should be damaged and aggressive. Or worse, that he'll have some sort of detrimental effects in his 20's, or need a lifetime of therapy. \n\nSo my question is - Do you think I'm doing the right thing? Should I be doing something else? Was I wrong to ever let this begin, would I be wrong to put a stop to it? My son seems so happy, am I missing something? I've discussed this with him before but..... I'm just unsure. Everything seems fine, but everything I read says it should be the opposite. What do you think? \n\nThank you to anybody who has read this far. I look forward to your response! \n\nPS: It's a throwaway, of course. \n\n\n",

            "selftext": "My son has always been really into video games. We didn't keep any in the house while he was little, but he's had ready access to them at his bio-dad's house, and we eventually did buy a Wii a couple of years ago when the price came down. He's had a problem with asking to play them every day, even when he knew that he wasn't allowed on weekdays, but it was more annoying than problematic. \n\nThen his dad got him a cell phone for Christmas, and he started playing time management games. He gets home from school before my wife and I finish work, and it got so bad as far as him not getting his chores done or starting homework that I had to not only delete the games, but put a lock on the app store. So then he started playing web games, and we took his phone. So what's a kid to do? He snuck his 3DS (another Christmas present from bio-dad) into his room and played it all night. We confiscated that too. I had to change the password on the computer, even though that means he can't start a lot of his homework until we're home either. We take the power cable from the TV to work with us. When he gets caught, he's been grounded. Entire weekends, shoveling dog poop and scrubbing toilets. He's been banned from all electronics, and we've told him, \"if you can just get this impulse under control, you can earn back playing games again,\" but then he goes to his grandparent's house and repeatedly tricks them into letting him use their computer or phone. The other day, he got into my desk, found an old phone with a cracked screen, and charged it so he could play games on there. Turned out I had an alarm set for watering the lawn last summer, he got busted. My wife had to adjust her schedule to try to make it so he's not home alone, and yesterday she was with him all day. They had a good day, he played swords with a friend, they went hiking (we were worried some of this obsession was because he didn't have other things to do), but when they got home my wife laid down for a nap while he did the dishes. When she woke up she found the house quiet, so she went to his room and he'd stopped halfway through doing dishes to get into her purse, get out her iPod, and play a ball rolling maze game that came preloaded on it. \n\nWe're at our wits end. It isn't about the video games, it's about the sneakiness. No amount of punishment, promise of reward, deep emotional conversation (wife's school is offering her a chance to go put earthquake sensors out at Yellowstone, but she might have to turn it down if he can't be home alone for an hour and a half until I'm off work) seems to work, and our fear is, if he's like this about video games, what happens when he discovers drinking or drugs?\n\ntl;dr Son is sneaky even when given ample proof it isn't in his best interest. Nothing we've tried is fixing the problem. \n\n\nEDIT: We have tried giving him a game schedule, or giving him games as rewards. Ever since he had the phone, he's decided that gaming is a right that he has, and when he had limited time he still tried to sneak more or threw fits about being cut off. These steps were just left out of my original post because it was already pretty wordy. But we've tried that. ",

            "selftext": "*So r/parenting didn't really care for the following, so I'll try here*\n\nA little background. I have been around kids of all ages much of my life. My sister is nine years younger than me, I have taught most ages in Sunday School, and friends of mine have kids of varying ages. I can't stand them. Recently, my wife and I took an eight-hour trip to Tennessee to pick up her cousins (4 and 5) to bring them down to Florida for the holidays. I have met them before. I know them and they know me.\n\nAnd so begun my first real extended, multi-day-and-night interaction with young children.\n\nThe experience with them thus far has really demonstrated all my fears about having kids, fears I've expressed to my wife, who wants to be pregnant soon (I'm 27; she's 24). As a whole, at least in my experience, children are self-centered, loud, impatient, gross and other unsavory things. Now, obviously I get that they are kids and don't know any better. But why should *I* have to deal with these inexperienced humans?\n\nI have seen kids cry because they've dropped something for the 12th time and their parents refuse to pick it up again. I've seen kids yell when told they are not allowed to just take off their pants in public. I have seen them rebel when told not to touch something; then, with eyes locked they extend a single finger and touch the very thing they were just told not to. I have heard incessant screaming, seen poop smeared everywhere, food rubbed into the carpet - and while all of the above is happening, another kid will come up, as you to watch a trick of theirs or something, and then cry when you're not paying immediate attention to them. If they're not sleeping, they literally cry *at* or endlessly and incoherently talk *about* everything. They are little horrors. Every kid I have been around is (but especially the aforementioned cousins), so it can't just be an isolated case of bad parenting or something. They push your limits constantly, get up 10 times before finally falling asleep, knock over drinks even when you ask them nicely - and then yell at them - to please pay attention to their flailing arms. And why do they even do all this? Why do they cry that they're hungry after not eating the waffle they begged you to make for them? Is it entertaining to them, do they want attention, do they just not know what they want? And if they don't know what they want, how am I supposed to?\n\nI do not endorse corporal punishment, but I can honestly see why some parents beat their kids. I mean, they just drive you to your wit's end, knowingly, methodically and without restraint. Is all of parenthood just one big war, waged over the course of hundreds of little battles a day? You can't reason with them, they don't care about your stupid logic or that you'll have to pay for / clean up the consequences of their shit. So what is there left to do, when you're tired, broken and mentally spent? I mean, sometimes you just wanna kick the shit out of them. We can't really do that, though, so I for one have found myself verbally belittling the cousins staying with us, saying \"whatever\" when they want to show me something or letting my exasperation show plainly. I tell them they have no self-awareness, responding to a question with \"be quiet\" or \"please just stop talking.\" Basically anything I can do to convey to them I'm annoyed with them. But they probably don't pick up on it, and if they do, it's probably extremely damaging to their little psyches, which of course just perpetuates the problem.\n\nAnd that's just the direct annoyance of living with and raising children. Not to mention how they consume almost every minute of your waking life. Get up? Gotta make them breakfast. Home from work? Can't just relax, make dinner and watch TV. You have to make them food, clean them up, help them with homework, bathe them, brush their teeth, play with them, read to them, get them ready for bed: all this before you even think about yourself. That's what's required to not have terrible kids, right? How do you not just collapse after day and week and month and year of this? Do you love them that much? And if it is love and not just obligation, do you ever regret your decision? Do you wish it was easier?\n\nPlease understand my heart. I *want* to love kids. I want to want to have them. (Mainly because my wife desperately wants them and the delay has put a slight infrequent strain on our marriage). They're cute and I've seen parent/child relationships that put other loving relationships dynamic to shame. But they're work, right? And even if you do everything right - if you follow the latest research and use the correct teaching methods, and are loving, kind and patient - your kid could still be the worst, because, well they're a kid. But why go through it? Is it really all worth it?\n\nMy point in all this is a question - will it be the same with my kids? I mean, are (young) kids *really* as consistently awful as my experiences lead me to believe? Are your kids better? Does your love for them literally and figuratively cover all the crap they do? Please help me. Cuz it seems to me like kids are just annoying, selfish, awful creatures, who can be cool and rewarding, sure, but probably aren't worth the time/money/strain.",

It got me to thinking about parenting and I decided I would probably pull my kids out from sex-ed, not because I don't wish for them to learn, but because I'd rather they learn in an environment I am in control of and where the information is not portrayed in an unsavory way.\n\nFor example, I find it disgusting that a kid's first exposure to genitals (perhaps), at such a formative age is seeing photos of diseased bits. It's one thing to learn anatomy and the harms of STD's but to use nasty photos as a scare tactic bothers me and could even traumatize the kid into being \"disgusted\" by genitals, particularly of the opposite sex which they've never seen. Also, the anatomy books hardly look like real genitals, with gaping \"holes\" on the women and curved penises somehow sticking out away from the body on the men. I would rather have them look at an anatomy book more similar to the \"average\" bits.\n\nMoreover, while I want my kid to get the facts (in as academic/objective way as possible) I don't want them normalized to the idea of sex before marriage. I come from a religious background and they will ultimately have to make decisions for themselves. But I do believe that religious morals are important and abstinence is important. That does not mean not educating them about contraceptives (which are fine) or pregnancy etc., which I would do.\nWhat do you think?",

            "selftext": "So my mom has just started giving me and my brother a monthy allowance of $20, but only if we do enough chores (normally around 30) that she thinks equates to $20. \n\nBut with so many people in the house doing chores it's hard to do enough to get paid. And $20 isn't enough to buy anything, like we have to buy everything we want/need (except like food) with this $20 and I feel like that's a bit absurd?? But I don't really know, so that's why I'm here.\n\nI've seen most teenagers get paid a weekly or monthy allowance whether they do a certain amount of chores or not, but when I politely bring that up to my mom she gets super angry at me. And I'd do chores anyway if that were the case. \n\nSo my question is do you think $20 a month for my brother and I is a good amount? I don't want to be greedy I just want to know if it's a proper amount. Thanks.\n\nEdit: So a lot of you are thinking I'm complaining about this. I'm not. I was just wondering how average it is because everyone else I know gets more. And with having to use the allowance to buy everything (school lunch, clothes, etc) I was wondering if it was too little. Jeez. I don't know why ahould all got the idea I'm some terrible person for wondering something. \n",
