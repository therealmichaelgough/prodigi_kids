I just found out that my MIL and my husband's godmother will be paying for/hosting my baby shower. To which I am super thankful! \n\nI don't have a ton of girlfriends, and my closest family lives many states away and with the exception of my sister, no one has been jumping to offer to help plan anything. My family is small and doesn't family well.\n\nI should also prefice this post by stating I suffer from Anxiety and have being taking meds to help manage my anxiety for several years now. Pretty sure the anxiety problems run in the family. (Fun times)\n\nDue to a thyroid problem, I truly didn't think that i would be in the position I currently find myself. While I am not at all unhappy with the situation and have been having a relatively easy pregnancy, I know that I don't like being the center of attention, I also struggle with the idea of people/friends/family (which I have to invite to this shower) buying expensive things for my little growing family because I had sex with husband.\n\nI know, I know,... and have been told from everyone that I'm looking at the situation the wrong way. \n\n\nI guess what I'm asking is there another way to look at this, a perspective that my irrational brain can come to that will allow me to be less anxious, and not so judgemental towards my very sweet/only wants to be helpful MIL?\n\nI also understand  that we can't afford to buy everything on our own. So the fact that husband's family is being generous doesn't go unnoticed. So the phrase \"it takes a village\" is understandable.\n\nMy rational brain can understand that we can't afford all these things that a baby needs, but part of my older more stubborn self is also like why do we need all this stuff. I want to listen to the wisdom for been there, done that mom's because I don't know what I'm doing. But the irrational part of my brain says well you'll figure it out on your own the way you have the whole of your life. Like somehow since I made it this far on my own I can do this first time motherhood business on my own too. Not once until this moment has my rational brain even thought \"why would you even want to do this on your own?\" Like I don't have a choice? (Silly brain)\n\nWhy can't I truly believe and understand that this sweet little baby deserves all the nice things and all the love I feel like I never got? I don't want my little boy to miss out on the love and caring friends and family we have in our lives because I didn't have the greatest upbringing. I know that currently I'm allowing my anxiety to make irrational decisions/ formulate thoughts for me and the baby, and that aren't fair. \n\nI'm sure I'm working through somethings that needs some professional talk therapy. But suggestions or advise is always welcome.\n\nAlso what advise can you give about inviting close friends that live out of state. \n\nIn the age of social media and sharing it's hard to know who is really happy for you that you're having a baby...like how much are they willing to participate, and should I even assume that they would want to.\n\n\nHoping to figure this out before September \ud83d\ude2c.\n\nThanks a bunch!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3", "subreddit_subscribers": 77691, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Struggling with the idea of the Baby Shower.", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1563964146, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/cgqvmt/struggling_with_the_idea_of_the_baby_shower/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, "comments": [{"all_awardings": [], "approved_at_utc": null, "author": "STPFB", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3594216r", "author_patreon_flair": false, "banned_at_utc": null, "body": "I don\u2019t have super specific advice, but I can tell you that people love babies. Pretty much everyone goes nuts for them. I didn\u2019t really realise this before having my own and was so surprised by how excited my grumpy uncles, great aunts I haven\u2019t met in years, the receptionist at work, my clients and their parents, people from high school and random people in the grocery store have been. I absolutely wouldn\u2019t worry about people not being genuinely happy for you (ESPECIALLY people who have their own kids. After having a baby I am so overjoyed when people are expecting/have a little one. It\u2019s ridiculous). People also care more about you than you realise. You are already very loved if people want to throw you a shower. \n\nWith that being said - you don\u2019t HAVE to have a shower. I specifically asked for a very small one - less than 10 people, and it didn\u2019t mean we went bankrupt. If you\u2019re truly not comfortable with it you could suggest a small party, a celebratory brunch or even skip it. Babies actually don\u2019t need all the stuff that you\u2019re told they do (I find american culture especially crazy with the baby stuff). Newborns are so little and do basically nothing. They need a place to sleep (which can even be your bed), clothes and diapers. The biggest expense for us was a pram. Maybe formula and bottles if you choose to go that route. They can be bathed in the sink and changed on a pad on whatever surface. My kid is 9 months and all his stuff fits in three drawers and a toy basket and he is very loved still. We don\u2019t have a diaper pail, changing table, tummy time/play mat, specific feeding stuff, we skipped the bassinet etc. People will also still bring you gifts when baby is born. If it\u2019s truly only the stuff you\u2019re worried about then don\u2019t be. \n\nWith that being said - it is so nice to have your village.

Also due in November. I am not looking forward to a baby shower. My MIL wants to do one, my family is a mess, and I really hate the idea of people being around me knowing and celebrating this intimate and delicate medical event that I wanted to stay private. (Have not even publicly announced our Pregnancy and though some people know now because the bump is obvious, still haven't and will never post it on social media) this was a special private moment for me. I loved how it stayed in my little world at home just me and my husband, no outside stress or opinion. Now that it's out , it's out. It's not so bad, honestly, and now that other people know I've noticed a lot of support and people going out of their way to be helpful. It's a reminder that these people care.\n\nMy compromise with my MIL (who is a doll, btw. Absolutely a light in my life) is that she is throwing a very small baby shower with 10 people where we are serving tea and my favorite easy to make foods. Gift's are not being asked for and registries are not being given (I have made ones for me and my husband for the discounts/ free baby boxes though!) If they absolutely want to give us something my MIL will ask them to give us diapers and wipes. That way we aren't overwhelmed with clothing.

The only time everyone attention was solely on me was opening gifts, and even then it's mostly seeing the cute baby clothes and what other people got. I think o had a mimosa.\n\nI pretty much just had to prepare mentally every day leading up. Once I got there I kinda put on my retail face and made nice and chatted a minute or two with everyone. Opening gifts I kinda just didn't make eye contact and tried to draw the focus to the presents. Thanked the people who brought them obviously.

The pre-baby shower was more typical, but since she was here for the other one, no one cared about us, haha. They all just wanted to see and hold her. \n3. We were fortunate enough to have gotten most of what we needed before she was born, so for the post-baby shower, we asked specifically for diapers and books. No one even wrapped anything, let alone wanted to watch us open gifts. A few people did bring a wrapped gift, but most didn't. \n\nI hope this helps! At the very least, know that you're not alone. The only reason we had any showers was because we are also first-time parents and needed so many things that we couldn't afford on our own. It's a tough spot to be in with anxiety.

A few tips - ask for them to do it as a couples shower. Perhaps a welcome baby bbq. This way your husband can be there to take some of the attention and with men there showers tend to be less formal.\n\nAlso, perhaps think of it as not being for you but for the baby. You want the baby to have everything you didn\u2019t and this is the start to that. Having the shower is not about saying you can\u2019t do it alone but that you don\u2019t have to. It is a first step to insuring that your baby is surrounded by loving people that they can rely on. It\u2019s a symbol to show that your baby will have the large and close family that you didn\u2019t get to have. \n\nAs far as friends that aren\u2019t close by, send them the invite. You can reach out to them right around when they should receive it to let them know that you do not want them to feel pressured to come or send a gift, but that you want them to know they are an important part of your life and you would like for them to be a part of the baby\u2019s life as well. \n\nYou can also put on the invite \u201cgifts are not expected, but will be appreciated.\u201d  This can relieve the feeling that you are obligating people to get you something. \n\nAs far as, \u201cI don\u2019t really need all this stuff\u201d I suggest looking at several example registries and things we used/wish we had lists that are on this sub. This can give you a better idea of what things you can leave off the registry. \n\nIt\u2019s ok to not want a shower and it\u2019s ok to be nervous about the attention it will put you under. But I would suggest that if your in laws are wanting to help you get ready for the baby, let them. Based on your post this shower is out of love for you, your husband, and your baby.

My mother in law and partners god mom planned the shower and paid for it. I invited every friend I could think of even though I\u2019m not close with anyone. I had one friend show up. Literally one. And some family members. On my partners side, he had well over 50people friends and family. I let him take reins being the more social one anyway. I freak out in any social situation and always need his help completing simple tasks like picking up prescriptions because my anxiety can get so bad. When we we opening presents we did it together but he did all the talking. It was nice to have the spotlight mostly on him and to not have to shout at a crowd of people myself ! But since I was the one who was pregnant of course everyone did want to talk to me. Usually in a party setting I won\u2019t say a word to anyone unless spoken to first. So during this event it was nice having so many people actually come up to me because it gave me the chance to interact and get social. I didn\u2019t get sad about not having any friends or only have one person show up, I focused on bonding with my partners family.

I was 8 months pregnant and I didn\u2019t even have any shoes that fit me anymore so I was barefoot. I was also very poor at the time and I felt I didn\u2019t deserve the baby shower. I never ask for help even when I need it. It was horrible I was crying in my head the whole time. Then when it came time to open gifts it\u2019s hits me. It wasn\u2019t for me. It was all for my baby. I was so thankful and grateful for all the gifts that my baby desperately needed. Without the baby shower I would have surly ran out of diapers, clothes, wipes, baby wash ect. My baby really really needed all of those things. I wasn\u2019t able to provide them all myself so even though I didn\u2019t enjoy my baby shower or all the attention I appreciate the gifts for my baby because they helped us soooo much.

Even my closest friends tried to convince me otherwise, saying well just do a small one, or just have people contribute money, or just do a small registry, etc etc\u2014all of these mitigating things that were based around the absolute truth (in their view) that you NEED a bunch of things for baby and it\u2019s stupid to try to buy them all yourself when other people want to buy them for you. \n\nRegistries overwhelm me. We didn\u2019t register for our wedding (we did a charity registry with different orgs that we thought our guests would care about\u2014most of them didn\u2019t donate which we were fine with, we wanted no pressure). People balked at us at first, especially because I was in grad school at the time and husband was a teacher. Why would you turn down free stuff when you\u2019re on such a tight budget?? But in my view we didn\u2019t NEED stuff for the sake of getting stuff, and for our first Christmas married we asked MIL for gift cards (my parents and I don\u2019t do gifts so it\u2019s really just MIL/family that we exchange gifts with) and with those we bought a bunch of house stuff we wanted to start the next chapter of our married lives. Still were smart about it money-wise, but didn\u2019t have to create a huge registry and have EVERY guest buy us something. \n\nFor baby, there was even more pushback. \u201cOkay, maybe you had some house stuff when you got married, but you have NO baby stuff! And there\u2019s SO MUCH YOU NEED!!!\u201d Again, we\u2019re on a budget, but the sheer thought of all the stuff that could just accumulate and take on a life of its own is so overwhelming to me\u2014and pps are so right. You DO NOT NEED THAT MUCH! We both have moms that really want to help, and if left to their own devices would buy literal tons of clothes and toys and different items, and we would drown in a sea of stuff. So, we\u2019re asking that they help us with the few big ticket things (carseat, stroller, crib and bassinet\u2014which the crib and/or bassinet aren\u2019t even necessities if you don\u2019t want to go that route AND the crib we want is $80 at Ikea so not that big ticket, but still). Then we will be picking up the other things as we go (we\u2019ve already hit up yard sales, FB buy/sell/trade, and other sales). \n\nThe thing that I kept thinking about was that, while people love to buy baby things, it\u2019s my feeling that they love to buy \u201ccute\u201d baby things in their style and aesthetic. So the argument about how \u201cyou need so many things, let people buy them for you\u201d always bothered me because no one wants to come to a baby shower having just bought a dehumidifier. (NOT a necessity, just an example of a \u201cboring\u201d baby item you may want). They want to come with a set of onesies with cutesy sayings they find funny, or a toy that lights up and plays music. The last time I went to a baby shower I bought a set of gender-neutral onesies from the registry and wrote a sweet card, but felt like a total loser when every other gift she opened was 1) not on the registry and 2) was cool and personalized to the gift-GIVER. Which is fun for them, but as the recipient, it\u2019s not actually serving the purpose everyone says it will. You can, I think, buy for yourself all of the practical things your baby needs, even on a budget, and even without a shower you\u2019ll probably STILL get some cutesy stuff from people here and there, but to me it\u2019s less overwhelming\u2014it\u2019s a one-off gift, it\u2019s not everyone you know feeling obligated to get something from a super long list you felt pressured to make. (If you didn\u2019t feel pressured to make it, and you\u2019re fine with baby showers, then that\u2019s awesome! My issue is just with people who don\u2019t want one being pressured into it. If you\u2019re happy and willing then I\u2019m glad!)\n\nWe still want to celebrate the joy with close family members, and we know they\u2019ll want to buy something, so what we\u2019re hoping to do is ask everyone to bring a favorite children\u2019s book and sign the inside with a message for little one to read every time they read that story! That way it\u2019s still a personal gift, they get to feel connected in their own way, but to me it feels more manageable. I want them to feel involved, I want to share the joy, but I also don\u2019t want to end up with a million \u201cgrandma is my homegirl/my aunt is awesome/I get my looks from grandpa\u201d onesies and seventy light up glow worm toys that play music. That\u2019s just what we\u2019re doing and your family may be different! I have a pretty messy side of the family too, and MIL is the one who would be throwing the shower. I totally understand the trepidation you feel and I think it\u2019s good to talk through all the feelings you\u2019re having about baby showers and family and everything they entail! And finally\u2014don\u2019t let anyone make you feel like less THINGS mean baby will feel less loved/happy/cared for/safe. Sorry for the LONG post. \n\nTL;DR: You don\u2019t HAVE to have a shower, even if you\u2019re on a budget. If you want you could ask for a small sentimental gift (book or blanket) from each person in a small gathering to still celebrate the occasion without making a registry. And finally\u2014don\u2019t let anyone make you feel like less THINGS mean baby will feel less loved/happy/cared for/safe.
