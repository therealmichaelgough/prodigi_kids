I love my daughter, but I feel like I have no identity and I can't do anything I would do to keep developing any other part of myself.\n\nShe wants to eat every hour and a half during the day, and afterwards if I put her anywhere, she fusses and fusses and fusses (scream cries). So I have to be holding her or carrying her (which doesn't always work either). Or if I can get her down and sleeping, she might sleep for ten minutes and then wake up and fuss. Ican't clean, I can't really read, I can't write (writing is my big passion). I can barely even keep myself fed because she starts crying in the time it takes to make toast.\n\nPlus almost every time I feed her, she spits up afterwards. Even if she ate an hour ago (small frequent feedings) or if she's upright. I feel like she's gross and I'm gross and I can't keep us clean and happy at all.\n\nI have no family in the area so by the afternoon, I feel totally trapped and counting down the hours until my husband gets home. What works one day to make her happy doesn't work the next day. I think I understand her cues but then I guess I'm wrong.

Check into reflux, learning more about it will help. My first need zantac before he quit crying like that.  Plus he started gaining weight after that. I'm breastfeeding my 3rd and I gotta say, you might have to make a food log to figure out if it's something you're eating. My babies did/do not like eggs or McDonalds chicken nuggets. Weird, I know. I try to steer clear and it helps a lot. \nColic is also a thing. There are so many reasons babies cry,  you'll drive yourself crazy trying to figure it out. As long as you've offered the breast and changed their diaper there isn't much to do besides hold them. Sometimes babies wear themselves out crying and then guess what they do after that? Cry more. Don't get me wrong, I definitely end up holding my little one pretty much all the time. Invest in a good baby carrier. I have the boba wrap and I love it.  Those days when they're fussy, put them in the wrap to get peace. \nMake sure you monitor her weight gain and check in with your pediatrician regularly. They might have good advice for you concerning colic, growth spurts/cluster feeding, reflux, etc. \nBreastfed babies, IMO, cry more and want to be held 24/7. Don't listen to people telling you you'll spoil her. Worry about that when she hits about 3 months and it could actually be the issue. At one month they cry because they need comfort or something is wrong (hungry,  etc). \nThis may sound crazy but I learned it from my first baby and it works. Breastfed babies don't always burp easily. I sit them upright against me, support their head and just wait a few minutes. A lot of times they will burp on their own. Or sometimes I have to do a few gentle  baby sit ups where I lay her back and then sit her up again and a burp will work itself out. I know it sounds crazy but it CHANGED MY LIFE. I would sit there and burp my first on my shoulder for 20 minutes and get nothing.  And then he would spit up because he had air in his belly. My oldest was tough as a baby.  He never stopped crying. Ever. (Until about 8 weeks lol) You'll get through it mama!  \nPS: if you need to see a picture to see what I'm talking about with the burping thing, PM me and I will have someone take a pic to send you.

Just go about your day doing the things you\u2019d like to do and bring baby along. Wanna make toast? Make toast. Wanna go to the park/museum/store. Just go. Yes there will be some screams and tears.

Mom of a 1 and 3 year old here, as well as a NICU nurse. What you\u2019re describing sounds like your baby has reflux. I would speak to your physician about it. If she\u2019s on formula, there are better formulas for reflux. If you\u2019re breastfeeding, the only real option is medication. \n\nShe is likely eating every hour and a half because she is waking up with reflux, and sucking is what soothes her, but since her stomach hasn\u2019t had a chance to fully empty, it gets even more full and she reflexes more. It\u2019s a vicious cycle, but I understand it\u2019s hard to stretch out the time between feeds when you have a screaming baby! If you haven\u2019t incorporated a pacifier at this point, I would recommend it to satisfy her urge to suck for self-soothing. I would also keep her upright for 30-60 minutes after each feed to aid in digestion. The little baby bouncy seats or swings are great for this. You can also try wearing her with a soft infant carrier or wrap of some sort. This will keep her upright, keep your hands free, and allow her a good nap. \n\nAll this being said, sometimes you can try a million things and they still cry. That doesn\u2019t mean you did anything wrong! It\u2019s the only way babies know how to communicate. Allow yourself to eat and shower while she cries. It is not harmful for an infant to cry for 10-20 minutes (or longer.) It\u2019s harder on us mommas than it is on the babies, I promise. Same with spit-up. If they\u2019re gaining weight, spitting up isn\u2019t harmful. Just messy. \n\nEverything with babies is a phase, but they do become more consistent and predictable around 3-4 months. I know this doesn\u2019t help today, but want to offer you that hope. \n\nSome of these things (messy house, messy clothes, less time for yourself) are part of parenthood that you WILL adapt too. It\u2019s very overwhelming right now and that\u2019s exacerbated by lack of sleep. IT WILL GET BETTER! \n\nEveryone is going to have their opinions. At the end of the day you have to decide what\u2019s best for you and your family. Be confident in your decisions, and take the advice you like and leave the rest.\n\nLastly, make sure you\u2019re checking in with your practitioner about your own mental health. If you\u2019re too overwhelmed to function properly, please don\u2019t be afraid to reach out to them to get help. \n\nHope some of this helped at least.

Try to get out of the house and go for a walk or just go walk around Target (you don't need to buy anything, but I always do anyway). Talk to your spouse or someone about how you are feeling because it does help. If these feelings dont get better, start talking to your doctor about postpartum depression. \n\nOne thing I will say is that pretty much all babies have reflux. Their GI system is not mature and it results in spitting up. It can also be exacerbated by an over supply or and overactive letdown. It eventually does lessen and then goes away around 6-9 months. If she is screaming, arching her back after feeds, or seems uncomfortable, definitely talk to her pedatrician about meds.

I, too, am a mom of a 1 month old baby. My darling, sweet, adorable, great napper turned into a screaming colicky upset mess around the 2.5 week mark. (I\u2019m really tired so I can\u2019t remember exactly when...) I spoke with my doctor about what was going on and why she was 1. screaming all the time (they should use it as torture on prisoners. Would totally work.) 2. Spitting up everywhere 3. Looked like she was horrendously uncomfortable 4. Was (and still is sometimes) waking up after a little bit screaming and not getting proper amounts of sleep because of it.\n\nHer pediatrician said it\u2019s likely reflux and gas. We got her onto a different formula, got her some baby Zantac, and some gas drops. I\u2019m extra vigilant about burping her. I do leg bicycles and legs to chest often to help with moving things along in her intestines. She gets warm baths to relax her muscles and help move the gas along. I also have been giving her cold formula because she seems to like it, which I suspect is because it feels good on her raw esophagus.\n\nShe\u2019s... getting better. To be fair, yesterday sucked. Yesterday sucked so hard. Screaming non stop all day. But today she\u2019s only slightly fussy. She\u2019s only had one bout of spitting up today (at the same time she was having a poo-splosion. If I wasn\u2019t so impressed at the shenanigans that were this morning, I\u2019d probably be horrified. Mom life...) and she\u2019s less fussy than she was all last week. Not 100% but better, at least.\n\nMaybe speak to your pediatrician about why your LO could be a screaming, crying mess?\n\nI hear the digestive issues get better around when the \u201c4th trimester\u201d ends. That possible light at the end of the tunnel is what\u2019s keeping me semi-sane. That, and reminding myself that it must really suck for my LO and she\u2019s obviously uncomfy.\n\nGood luck, mama!", "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "created_utc": 1533599938, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e3qe04f", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_94cklg", "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_94cklg", "permalink": "/r/Mommit/comments/94cklg/maternity_leave_with_a_onemonth_old/e3qe04f/", "retrieved_on": 1533599939, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"approved_at_utc": null, "author": "CheeseItTed", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "banned_at_utc": null, "body": "Yeah, that makes sense.
