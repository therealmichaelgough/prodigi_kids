I didn't want to eat like that any more nor did I want to feed my toddler that stuff. I signed up for the clean eating slow cooker meal (but you can change your plan a few times a month, I just prefer this one right now. The low carb one is pretty good). I can put the kid down for a nap, throw everything in the slow cooker and clean up the kitchen, then make the side dish right before SO comes home from work (or alternatively if you work or don't have a SO, the side dishes don't usually take very long so dinner would be ready pretty quickly after getting home from work). I like that it's kind of a no-brainer, they give me my dinner shopping list (and dinners for two adults and one child have been running me around $50-80/week for groceries, depending on where I shop), and typically there are leftovers so I just eat those for lunches. \n\nBreakfast is usually oatmeal or eggs, with fruit on the side or sauteed veg in my eggs, with coffee and milk/sugar (and I'm working on getting myself off the sugar in my coffee, but since I don't drink pop/soda, or otherwise eat a lot of process sugar, I am not really worried about it yet).\n\nLunch is leftovers and/or a salad. Yesterday I had [leftover beef and carrot curry] (http://www.reddit.com/r/slowcooking/comments/23oj84/garlic_ginger_curried_beef/) with rice. The slow cooking menu usually gives me lots of leftover shredded meat, so I'll also make salad wraps. \n\nDinners are things like honey-orange pork loin with roasted cauliflower and snap peas or chicken thighs with carrots and potatoes, brown rice and sauteed cabbage and bell pepper. \n\nSnacks are usually carrots/cucumbers/sliced peppers with [hummus] (http://www.inspiredtaste.net/15938/easy-and-smooth-hummus-recipe/) or [baba ganoush] (http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ellie-krieger/babaganoush-recipe.html), which I try to make at least once a week (again, after the kid goes to bed). I like my hummus a little spicy, so I usually make [Sriracha hummus] (http://www.budgetbytes.com/2012/03/sriracha-hummus/) rather than plain hummus. Trader Joes/Whole Foods/Kroger also have decent hummus, but I'm also super cheap and trying to not spend a lot of money at this time. I notice if I process my produce and always have cut up carrots/cucumbers/peppers/strawberries/etc. in the fridge, I'm more likely to eat them so my produce doesn't go bad, and the work is already done so I can't be lazy about it.
