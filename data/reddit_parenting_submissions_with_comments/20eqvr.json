Formula feeders are not some poor, persecuted minority.  Less than 15% of moms in the US breastfeed past 6 months.  Less than 15%.  And that's breastfeeding AT ALL, not even exclusively.  The number of moms EBFing past 6 months is even lower.\n\nBreastfeeding moms don't \"shame\" formula feeders.  Breastfeeders are the ones who are shamed -- for showing our tits in public, for letting our kids have an \"unnatural\" (aka, nonsexual) relationship with our breasts, for not weaning early enough.  We have to have laws passed to protect our right to feed our kids, and despite those laws, we all still take tons of shit.  \n\nWhat I think happens is that moms who use formula have internalized guilt about not breastfeeding.  They KNOW that breast is best, but for whatever reason (biology or choice), they don't breastfeed.  As a result of their guilt over the issue, every time someone *mentions* breastfeeding, they take it as personal goddamned affront, like \"how dare you mention the fact that you breastfeed, when all you're really doing is condemning the way I feed my kid.\"  Breastfeeders are not condemning the way you feed your kid.  We're talking about the way we feed ours.  \n\nI will tell you, in the 9 months I've been EBFing my kid, I have never once said anything negative to any one of my (many, many) friends who formula feed.  But they have ALL told me that they think I'm crazy, making sacrifices for no reason, and that I should at least supplement with formula.  Every last one of them.  \n\nSo stop with the persecution nonsense.  I think I speak for the vast, vast majority of breastfeeders when I tell you that no one gives a shit how you keep your kid alive.  \n\nEdit: Well, now I wish I hadn't used a throwaway...

After reading your comment I've really thought about my friends and peers. I can think of about 50 current mom friends and acquaintances I have and I can think of about 5 formula feeders.\n\n\nAlso I invite you to look at where the upvotes and downvotes are in this thread. It sure seems that in our peer group the majority of people breastfeed. \n\nHaving many mom friends I know that you are speaking for the vast majority of EBFers, but believe me when I tell you that the persecution is definitely not nonsense - absolutely not by all but it does happen. You don't live it, you haven't walked a mile in our shoes, you don't know what it's like so venturing the guess that \"maybe they just feel guilty and take things too personally\" is just that, a guess. Maybe true for some but by making that generalization on FFers you are just as bad as those who claim all EBFers are fanatics. There's the real unpopular opinion. \n\nOne thing is for sure and I think what this article is ACTUALLY about and actually trying to convey is that it sure does hurt when you know something is best for your child but you can't provide it for them and then someone shames you for it. So those who do it, please stop.
