The main thing affecting this opinion is a friend who attempted home birth with twins. 1st one came out fine, 2nd one had her cord around her neck and friend took an ambulance ride trying not to push while her midwife pushed back against her contractions. The lack of oxygen has affected the baby in a profound way and she is physically and developmentally delayed. It's sad all around but I feel like in a hospital setting, this could have been avoided.

I wound up taking an IV of Fentanyl while dilating because I couldn't handle the pain of the Pictocin. I had the IV cut when it was time to push and pushed for 2.5 hours. My daughter inhaled amniotic fluid during this and had to be in the NICU for 6 days clearing out her lungs and stabilizing. I was extremely grateful to be in a hospital both for mine and my daughter's sake. \n10. I didn't have a midwife but my OBGYN discussed this in depth. She was open to low intervention unmedicated birth in various positions but as the pregnancy wore on and I developed DVTs etc my options became limited and the hospital I was set to deliver at was changed due to the larger branch having a high risk unit.\n11.

I'm in the UK where homebirths are quite encouraged for suitable mothers with uncomplicated pregnancies, we have teams of community midwives who have met you throughout your pregnancy and will attend- they're all fully qualified, midwives lead all \"normal\" births here even in hospital where they have their own ward, births are only taken to the doctors ward if certain kinds of medical intervention are necessary.  I think they're the best option for many women who would feel more comfortable and relaxed in their own homes than in hospital as long as they have qualified assistance and aren't too far from a hospital in case of complications.

In active labour the midwives shifts changed twice so there was little rapport.  It ended in a caesarean which I feel may not have been necessary if my care had been different.\n10. If you have had previous pregnancies did you feel that your midwife gave you enough information on home and hospital birth benefits/cons? Yes, we have all the options made clear along with the results of studies into the statistical outcomes of the different options.\n11. Do you feel like you would chose the same option of delivery again?  I would like to not have to go to hospital and to have future children at home or in a more relaxed setting but I don't think I would be allowed to because of my past caesarean.  Note that by \"allowed\" I mean they would *strongly* advise not to (although if you absolutely insist and go into labour and call them and still refuse to go to hospital they will send midwives to attend) and in that case of course it's wise to take their advice.

I live in a major metropolitan area on the east coast of the US where there are a variety of choices for birth available to you if you can get to them, from Baby-Friendly certified hospitals to free-standing birth centers, to hospital birth centers, OBs in hospital, midwives in hospital, and Certified Nurse Midwife attending a birth in your own home. I have had a few friends pursue homebirth and looked into myself.\n6. No\n7. n/a\n8. Yes\n9. Both of my births have been in hospital, one with an OB, one with midwives (CNMs), both attended by a doula. My first experience was fine. I would describe it as trauma-free and well-supported, but chaotic. My prenatal care, while medically fine/sound, left something to be desired in terms of the human touch component and the way my concerns were dealt with (skepticism of Bradley birth, skepticism over my birth plan, the manner in which my induction (ultimately unnecessary) was scheduled, and other similar things. My second birth was with midwives and I got the well-woman (as a opposed to Pregnancy Is An Illness) perspective I was looking for, the person-to-person connection and education components I was looking for as well. I was not able to decline all interventions (I still had to get antibiotics for example, and an IV port placed), but overall, as a low-risk patient, I was pretty in control of my choices. The hospital still has limits on how you labor (I was still in a bed because there are no other options, etc.). I think most of my positive experience can be attributed to the partnership and trust between me and my midwives, a nursing staff and hospital that is mostly on board with unmedicated/low to no intervention birth, and being a very low-risk patient. Some of those things you can control, some (the last one) you can do your best to give yourself the best shot at, but ultimately can't control completely.  \n10. In my third pregnancy, I discussed with my midwives choosing a home birth (which would have meant leaving them to work with a different CNM). They were very open in discussing the pros and cons with me--both medical and non-medical. With my low-risk history they agreed I was a good candidate. Ultimately, because I know I could have the birth I desired at the hospital with them, I stayed with the hospital. If I had had different experiences, but was similarly low-risk I believe I would feel differently. The reasons I chose to stay at the hospital include: 1) the administrative burden to get my insurance to cover was more than I was willing to take on; 2) we have pets and I knew they would both me during labor 3) the stand-alone birth center we considered transfers to a hospital where I don't have a lot of confidence in their L&amp;D and post-partum care. So you can see what I mean--if I had had less than desirable experiences at the hospital, it probably would have been enough to surmount some of those cons. \n11.

My Doula was a direct-entry midwife in training and had attended almost 100 home births between several Amish communities.

My midwives would have attended my birth at the hospital, so home vs hospital was not as stark of a choice for me.

It was a horrible experience. I developed HELLP syndrome so I was immediately induced even though the baby wasn't quite done cooking. I was too sick to be given an epidural, and also too sick (and too sedated by the medication for the sickness) to be able to speak or understand what was spoken to me. I was too sedated to be allowed to labor in the tub (which was in my birth plan). I was too sick and sedated to remember when to breathe when they tried to let me use nitrous oxide. Mid-contraction I was perfectly in the moment; I don't think I have ever been more zen in my life. My entire world was just an endless expanse of pain. I had no concept of time, I wasn't aware that the pain was from a contraction or that it had a start and an end, I was simply in pain. I had no concept of space, I wasn't aware I was on my side or in a bed or in a hospital, I was simply in pain. I was unaware I was having a baby. All there was, was pain. At the end of each contraction I immediately fell asleep and only woke up for the next contraction.  After the delivery I did not care about anything except sleep. I held the baby only because someone put the baby in my arms. I couldn't feed the baby because I kept falling asleep. I didn't really wake up for two days, and then only because they turned off the IV medication drip because I was having a rare side effect to it which would have killed me if they kept going. They hoped the HELLP syndrome would start to improve by itself. Instead it got worse. They waited to see how much worse it would get. A blood transfusion was in the back room with my name on it. I very narrowly avoided requiring it. After another day I started getting better instead of worse. At that point I got more interested in the baby. My doctor, an MFM (a step up from an OBGYN), was fabulous. Women still die of HELLP syndrome in the United States in good hospitals, but she was on top of things for me and did the absolute best she could to help me survive. I have some lingering damage including that I will probably die of heart disease earlier than I would otherwise have died, but I'll probably get to retirement age first. It will probably take about ten years off my life. Overall I feel blessed that I can be in relatively good health for now, and that the baby was healthy despite being undercooked.  \n10. I saw a midwife once during pregnancy. She is a CNM who works with the MFM team at my hospital. She was a really poor listener compared to my doctor. She also gave me incorrect information about what my lab results meant. (My doctor later confirmed to me that what the midwife had said was wrong.) Home birth did not come up in our conversation. Later, when I came into the hospital with HELLP syndrome, the provider staffing the intake rooms that night was a different CNM. She was a better listener than the first one and seemed to take my concerns seriously. She diagnosed my HELLP syndrome quickly even though it's a rare disorder that even big hospitals don't see often. She did not mention home birth. Because home birth is not currently thought to be as safe as hospital birth for low-risk women, and because I was high-risk anyway, it makes sense that neither CNM mentioned it. Also they were not my main providers so it makes sense from that perspective too.  \n11. There is no way I would birth outside a hospital in the future. I am high risk enough to see an MFM rather than an OBGYN for three separate, unrelated reasons (one of which is that I am apparently prone to HELLP syndrome). Even if I were low risk I would choose a hospital birth.  \n12.

It wans't notably exceptional, but I don't have any complaints about my experience either. \n\n10. If you have had previous pregnancies did you feel that your midwife gave you enough information on home and hospital birth benefits/cons. \nDue to my medical history, I am not a candidate for midwife care or home birth.\n\n11. Do you feel like you would chose the same option of delivery again? \nI would (and will) choose a hospital birth again with my current pregnancy.  If I didn't have the medical history that I do, I would have liked the option of using a midwife and a birthing center as opposed to a traditional MD and hospital stay.\n\n12. If you said no to question 6 then would you ever consider home birth?\nNot for me.  While I know that many women have very successful home births, I like to plan for worst case scenario and I like the reassurance of being in or nearer the hospital in the event that something were to go wrong.

My midwife was devastated on my behalf, but we were all extremely thankful both my child and I made it through.\n10. Yes\n11. No, I have chosen to never have another biological child.\n12. After my previous pregnancy/labor/delivery I have been advised that I would likely be classified as high risk.

What is your oppion of home birth?\"\" I live in a small rural community that is very religious and suspicious of modern medicine. Most of my friends had home births (lots of large families). I am a transplant to this community and part of getting to know the ladies is sharing birth stories. Everyone seems to attend each other's births and woman recite statistics about hospital errors and how un careing a hospital atmosphere can be. My  oppion of home birth is that it is all about the mother not the baby. Every birthstory is about how empowered she felt and the beautiful spiritual experience birth was. Attending births is a bounding experience and supporting the mother before/during/and after birth is taken very seriously.\n\n**6. If you have had previous pregnancies where any of them homebirths?**  No. They were all natural- no drugs but I choose to go to hospitals. Two attended by CNM. One was great and the other obviously did not like my husband which was annoying.\n\n**7. If you answered yes to question 6, would you say your delivery went well, if not why not?** NA \n\n**8. Did you have a hospital birth?**  Yes. I don't care as much about personal empowerment. If anything happened to my baby that could have been prevented by being at a hospital . It would break my heart and I could not forgive myself.\n\n**9. If you answered yes to question 8, what was your overall experience?** It was very good. My last baby had shoulder distosioa. My OB saved her life. I told all my friends how caring the nurses were. My two teenage daughters attended the birth and they had grown up in this community hearing how horrible hospitals are. They were both impressed with the hospital experience. My youngest loved how clean it was and copatant everyone was. She asked lots of questions and the OB answerd everyone. Her expertise and caring are a big reason both my girls want hospital births someday.\n\n**10. If you have had previous pregnancies did you feel that your midwife gave you enough information on home and hospital birth benefits/cons**  Not from a midwife but my community is all about the benefits of home birth and gives lots of unsolicited information. Everyone had a secret trick. An oil of herb that works wonders.\n\n**11. Do you feel like you would chose the same option of delivery again?**  Absolutely. I feel my OB saved my baby when I had complications.\n\n**12. If you said no to question 6 then would you ever consider home birth?** I personally would not consider a homebirth. I just have a different personality than my friends. Even though I was going to the hospital the woman gatherd around me to sing and pray for me and my baby. After the birth We had two weeks of meals brought in. I am happy I had my community support even though I choose a hospital birth.

My second and third children were born at home.\n7. My deliveries were amazing. Completely opposite from the hospital experience and so much more relaxing, with a much quicker recovery.\n8. My first child was born in a hospital.\n9. The experience was okay. I was instructed to purple push while on my back, leading to a fourth degree tear with a long recovery time.\n10. I definitely found that my midwives were much more invested in me educating myself than the doctors were. At every appointment they made sure that all of my questions were answered and encouraged me to read everything I could about birth and the newborn stage. The midwives had a literal library for mothers to borrow from. The doctors made sure that I was on board with the hospital's birthing policies and that was about it.\n11.
