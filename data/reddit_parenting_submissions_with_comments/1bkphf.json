He was also born right after a huge storm that knocked out power in four states. We were in this little rural hospital that I had never been to before and they had just gotten power back the day before. They only had two birthing rooms and there were five women in labor that night. I was set up in a spare room where they kept all the old and broken equipment. \n\nI was only 1cm dilated when my water broke so the had to manually dilate me with a Foley catheter and no pain meds. The nurses were very helpful, but that night there were only three nurses for five women. My son was born at 6am. \n\nI was then moved to a more permanent room, but it was still not the normal room they use. All the furniture was broken in some way. Since we had just moved I only had three visitors: my husband, my mother who caught the red eye, and a friend who also moved with us (he and my husband are currently going to the same med school). \n\nThe food was terrible and came in small portions, I had to send my husband out to get me food, but there was hardly any food in the city because we just moved and the power outage meant that stores were out of food. I ended up eating plain bagels. I had a hard time feeding my son, and when the lactation consultant came by 38 hours after my son was born, she only spent about ten minutes with me. She basically came in, grabbed my breast, saw that my son latched and left. I had so many questions and no answers.\n\n I finally went home after two days to an apartment filled with boxes and my mom sleeping in the living room because there was no where else to sleep. My mom stayed for five days before flying back home, and my husband started med school two weeks later. I had no clue what was going on, I was so confused, alone, and stressed out. I don't know how I made it. But things are so much better now. My son is happy and healthy, I've made friends, and I've lost ten pounds so far. \n\nAnd that is my story of how I spent last summer.
