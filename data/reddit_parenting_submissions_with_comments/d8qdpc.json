All the daycare handbooks I have read allow them to stop accepting my child, for any reason, with 1 week notice.  However, it would take much longer than 1 week to find a new daycare. For both of my kids it took months to find a new daycare when they were first born, and again later when they were older and we moved. At my very first daycare they changed the policy so that payments happened through automatic withdrawls from my bank account initiated by them. We expressed that we weren't comfortable with that - and they told us that we had a week to conform or our children were not welcome there.  Perhaps that experience has me too on edge, but here are the things I am too afraid to tell them:\n\n* Please stop making drop off procedures so complicated.  It is hard enough to get children under the age of 5 to get out of the house in the morning.  Asking the parent to then help their kid take off outdoor shoes and put on indoor shoes, put on sunscreen, put away their lunch, get out their waterbottle, use the bathroom, wash their hands, sign in on a piece of paper, and move a rock with their name on it - then rinse and repeat for second child. While at the same time time I am supposed to sign in on two different electronic systems (four total across both rooms), check the cubbies for supplies, check the diaper table for other supplies, check the lunch area(s) for supplies, take off my own shoes, and wash my hands. This means that drop off can take anywhere from 10 min to 45 min depending on the mood of my children.\n* Ensure that your documentation is consistent - often handbooks, quick parent guides, email communication etc have different info on how many sets of clothes, whether or not to provide a water bottle, etc.\n* Don't tell my children you love them. Tell them they are awesome, tell them that they make your day, tell them you enjoy playing with them - but don't say you love them.  That isn't fair to children who need help understanding the difference between professional who will care for them during the day for a period of time and family/fictive kin who will be there for them for the rest of their lives.  If you \"love them\" but leave them when you find a new job at a new daycare - how do they know at 3 that they can trust other people in their lives who love them to stick around?\n*Stop asking me for donations. I understand the struggle of daycares, but the struggle of working parents is real too. I pay more for daycare than I would for in-state tuition. I pay more on daycare for one child than I do for two car payments.  Don't ask me to donate on top of it.
