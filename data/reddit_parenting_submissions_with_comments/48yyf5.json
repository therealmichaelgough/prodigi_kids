He diet was actually more restricted than your daughters when he was 2, but he would drink anything, so we snuck in pureed fruits and vegetables.  Don't feel bad about the iron drops- most kids need them at least occasionally.  We started our son on a gummy multi-vitamin around that age and that has helped too.  Here are a few things that have helped us:\n\n1) We introduce things several times, without bias.  We try to just put the food in a bowl next to his plate and leave it at that.  The bigger deal we make of it, the more he fights trying it.  Sometimes the site or smell just isn't appealing one day, but the next time it will be fine.\n2) We give him the option to eat the \"new thing\" or not.  We never make the main part of a meal a new item.  He may end up liking it enough to eat more and skip him macaroni, etc, but we don't plan on it.\n3) We do our best to accept any effort.  We actually don't even make him try a full bite of new foods- just a lick to get the flavor.  He almost always says \"yuck\" to the first lick and refuses any more, but the next time the food is around he is much more likely to try a real bite if he licked it last time.\n\nMy parents took the \"eat this or go to bed hungry\" approach and I feel it did significant harm to me, so I am determined to find another way to encourage good eating habits with my son.

I wouldn't worry about it too much. My ECE supervisor (I'm an ECE student) had a few great tricks for getting the kids to try new things though:\n\n* Give small portions, and I mean really small portions: e.g., a few florets of broccoli, a couple spoonfuls of fish and rice\n* Keep all food separated when placed on the plate; try items on their own first rather than mixed, like serving spaghetti with sauce on the side, or crackers and cheese next to one another, etc.\n* Prepare/cut what you can in front of them so they can differentiate the whole items from the portions (even better if they can be part of the process, like washing the fruit/vegetables)\n* Read books on foods/provide dramatic play food items so they can see what they are beforehand, and possibly get curious about trying them\n* Encourage them to 'test' the item with their other senses (touch, smell, look at it, describe the colour/feel/smell... Work up to licking it... This is my favourite method!)\n* Don't force anything, but when they ask for more of something, do ask if they've 'tested' a certain item that's still on their plate before serving them more of what they're requesting\n* Serve the same item in different ways: e.g., apples on their own, apple sauce, baked apples, etc.\n\nHopefully some or all of these ideas are helpful, but again, try not to stress it as others have said. It's completely common behaviour, and I honestly think it's a natural process as children become less sensorimotor-heavy in their exploration of the world.

That has iron too. Spinach wrap quesadillas were a hit, temporarily. Mostly, my three year old likes fruit and bread like products. Tonight, I decorated his plate with steak, kale and potatoes because that was my leftovers from last night. He didn't touch it, but at least he's seen the stuff and can name kale now. :)", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1457577424, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "d0u7rzf", "link_id": "t3_48yyf5", "parent_id": "t3_48yyf5", "retrieved_on": 1460547759, "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"author": "Crysanthia", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "My kid doesn't like meat.. I think it's a toddler thing with texture.  He will eat fish sticks though, they have to be processed (I've tried making home made which of course he won't eat).  He also likes meatballs, again processed.  I think the texture is smoother.  It helps if it's smothered in pasta sauce.  Actually, I have a lot of luck putting pasta sauce on things I want him to eat.  \n\nI get his iron in with baby food packs, but also dry cereal (he eats the flakes like chips), and raisins.  I've heard quinoa is great for iron.  I haven't tried it yet, but was thinking making a simple dish with cooked quinoa, with pasta sauce and a bit of cheese.\n\nHe also doesn't like veggies.  So again, fruit/veggie lacks.  But.. He loves corn.  He will eat an entire plate of corn!\n\nLast tip, try offering something \"new\" along something you know she or he will eat.  If he's already eating, it's more likely he will try the others options.
