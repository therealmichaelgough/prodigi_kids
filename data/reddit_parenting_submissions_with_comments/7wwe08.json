I need your opinion on one topic. \n\nI am getting married in three weeks. \nThe setting: We are in Europe. The wedding will be in a place with no public transport available, we are booking a bus for all the guests and it is one hour ride. It is 79 km from the original destinations and taxis are super expensive. Public transport is not an option.\nThe bus picks up the guests at 11.30 AM and brings them back at around midnight or later. So the whole thing is around 13 hours and with no way to escape.\n\nWe planned an entirely adult wedding: music, unlimited supply of wine and beer, trivia games etc. etc. Nothing, nada, nichts is there for children. \n\nSo today we were skyping with my future in-laws and they were  like: \"Oh, X and Y(13 months old) are coming too. Booked tickets from a US city\". The original plan and confirmations we got were that they are not coming. They just changed their mind and never told us. \n\nSo I have zero experience with children. Is it even realistic that a toddler (who took a 14 hour flight) feels ok next day at a wedding that lasts so long? There might be a changing room, no clue about it. There is no place for the child to take a nap. The wedding is most likely inside as it will be cold. The restaurant is not huge and it will be loud. There is no room for any privacy unless they will lock themselves up in a restroom. Outside might be not an option as it is still cold here. We will also have music there and loud guests.  Obviously, no other children will be there. \n\nCan a toddler take a nap when it is so loud? Can it eat normal food from her mother's plate or do I need to do some special food arrangements with the restaurant? I am horrified, I see an exhausted, non-stop crying child, frustrated guests and upset parents. I need tips on what we could do to stick to the adult wedding but make the stay for the child, parents and guests comfortable.
