At first I was nervous because all the other kids were walking and she's barely crawling and standing on her own. Luckily, she was able to keep up with the older kids.)\n\n\n\n\nWhile the kids were playing, there was this 12 month old girl laying on the ground. My girl went up to her and put her hand on her face. Didn't grab just kind of started to pat her face. Almost instantly, the mother grabbed my daughter's hand, twisted her arm and she fell to the floor. I was SO mad but because we were basically visitors, I didn't want to cause a scene. I let it play out until my girl fell to the floor. Luckily she didn't cry and wasn't phased. The mother apologized and I said quietly, \"Yeah, don't ever grab my kid again.\" and picked up my girl and walked away.\n\n\n\nHow would you have handled this situation? I have never been in this situation before so I wasn't sure what to do. I was SO mad and should have said, \"HEY! RELAX! Don't grab by daughter.\" But I didn't want to be rude because it was our first class.
