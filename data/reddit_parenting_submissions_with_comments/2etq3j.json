I also got a bonus mom-shaming!\n\nI joined a local baby wearing group on Facebook to try to connect to other moms and they were having a meet up in the next town over. Another mom expressed interest in trying out my Ergo360, so I popped over with my husband. It was obvious that all of the moms there already knew each other and had established friendships as they were sitting in tight circles facing each other. I'm not shy and am generally outgoing, so I assumed I'd fit right in. I plop our blanket down and say hi to the moms next to me. \n\nOther mom: \"Oh, what carrier do you have?\"\nMe: \"An Ergo360! We picked this one because our daughter really likes facing forward.\"\nOther mom: \"Uh huh\" and she turned away. \n\nHmmm. Not the reaction I was expecting. Then the group leader came over and checked out the Ergo and was commenting how it was the better of the forward facing options out there. After hearing the group leader speak...\n\nOther mom: \"Well, I'd just NEVER forward face my child.\" The group leader at this point gave me a look as though she agreed with the other mom and proceeded to go on and on about how it would only hold a child up to a measly 30 lbs.\n\nApparently, at least from what I gathered about this mom group, is that the only acceptable baby wearing is done with either a wrap or a sling. How horrible was I for bringing an Ergo, let alone the one that allows forward facing! I quickly met up with the mom who wanted to try my Ergo (her little girl loved it by the way) and then my husband and I booked it out of there. \n\nI don't think I've ever felt so judged and isolated in such a short amount of time.

If one of the moms had responded to her, \"Ah, we went with this Mei Tai since we're not comfortable with the strain forward-facing puts  on the crotch,\" it's likely that would have been seen as hurtful as well. \n\nMany people put a lot of thought into the choices they make for their children, and get very up-in-arms when people make different choices - as if the fact that they didn't make the choice you made is a slight to you, specifically. I'll even see people be preemptively aggressive - like \"Oh, I work so my son's in daycare... WHICH IS SO GOOD FOR HIM. Kids who don't go to daycare are SO deprived. Where do you work? Or... do you stay home?\"\n\nDoes anyone have a good way to navigate this? Sometimes it's probably okay to just walk away due to different parenting decisions (i.e. anti-vax parents).
