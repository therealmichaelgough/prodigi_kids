My husband and I have an opportunity to take a vacation without our baby for up to five days. \n\nFor the most part, I'm ok with an occasional night out and having a babysitter. So far, we have only had two overnight babysitting times, partly because of scheduling/availability/drama. My husband and I used to go on spur of the moment trips fairly often, but now things have to be more scheduled and I'm finding it hard to leave our daughter. Going on a vacation without her feels like when she started at daycare and I would cry everyday for two weeks straight. I was happy when my husband started doing the drop offs because I didn't have to anymore. It's still hard when I actually walk out of the house (when she's babysat at home) even though I have a wonderful time and need to go out. \n\nMy husband misses the trips that we would take and spending time with me. Even when we have a babysitter, our time is fairly limited. He's chafing at the limitations, is cooped up, and feels that our daughter will be perfectly fine without us. The person who actually babysits aside, he thinks all of her needs will be perfectly taken care of and if they're not, we should address it after the fact. He seems to have no qualms at all about spending a few to several days away from our baby. He's excited about the possible trip and while I do want to go and spend time with him and our friends who will be there, too, I can't help but dread leaving my baby and cry at the thought.\n\nAm I being too clingy?

My daughter is 10 months so I'm a bit behind you. I'm still amazed at all the changes from week to week and love how cute she is as she explores her world.

Right now I resent anything that takes away my quality time with Baby Girl.\n\nI also think love language plays a big part. Mine are equally touch and quality time, so being with the people I love most is of utmost importance. If I feel like I haven't gotten enough snuggle time with my daughter one day, the next I am irritable, moody, and easily annoyed by little things.
