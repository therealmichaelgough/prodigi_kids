It was really, really, REALLY hard with my daughter. She was a cluster feeder, milk wouldn't come out very fast or much at all, I was engorged and in a lot of pain, my nipples bled and scabbed over. Taking a shower was excruciatingly painful. The sleep deprivation made me hallucinate. It seemed like she would latch on to each side for 45 minutes at a time, then fall asleep for 30 minutes, wake up, and want to do it all over again. There were times when I felt like literally peeling the skin off my chest and never doing it again. The lactation consultant I spoke with after week three of no sleep and feeling like I was going insane suggested I sterilize a needle and try to open the pores on my nipples larger. I was horrified. I also really wanted her dad to be able to feed/bond with her, so I pumped as much as I could and ended up supplementing with formula.\n\nI know things could be a lot different with the next baby, but I am apprehensive. I'm 37 years old, my husband works long hours, and I have an extremely energetic child who's almost four. I'm trying to figure out how to juggle keeping up with her, breastfeeding an infant, and still keeping up with all my other responsibilities. I also have to start working soon after having the baby, no matter what I end up doing. Most likely, it won't be the sort of job where I can go into a locked room and pump in peace. And we can't survive for very long on just my husband's income. \n\nI think people are defensive about it because formula is no longer the go-to, automatic choice for many moms. There's a definite push back to more natural childbirth, childcare, and feeding. Even my friends who had serious medical issues that made it impossible to breastfeed their babies felt tremendous, overwhelming guilt that they \"failed\" somehow. Women who've planned for natural births but ended up with emergency c-sections feel as if they've \"failed.\" \n\nWhen it comes right down to it, I think *most* people understand that \"breast is best.\" Being unable to do it when you really want to is upsetting, but *choosing* not to . . . well, you know that opens the door to all sorts of judgment that those moms don't really need or want, so they stick to the response you have heard.

I work full time. I took 6 weeks off of work when I had my daughter. That's six weeks that I could have breastfed, but I didn't because it's only six weeks and then I was back to work. I run a family practice office. I am constantly on the phone, working with patients, receiving, checking out, I am the billing department, the insurance specialist, the medical records department. I answer all phone calls and faxes and emails that come in. I don't have time to pump. Breastfeeding after that 6 weeks would be impossible, so I decided that I would skip the potential latching, supply, weening problems and just enjoy spending time with my baby before I went back to work.\n\nThe second reason is no family support. I was bottle fed as were all of my siblings. My sisters had children before I did, and their children were all bottle fed. It's not like my family discouraged breastfeeding, they wouldn't have tried to convert me if I had breastfed. But they would ask why and I would have to explain and defend a choice that I wasn't really gun-ho about in the first place. I considered breastfeeding, but I wasn't enthusiastic about it.\n\nThose are my biggest reasons. My smaller reasons include not caring for the breast pain, wanting to give my husband a chance to bond with her, being able to go out for the day without breastfeeding in public or pumping or leaking all over my shirt.\n\nThe bottom line is in my family and with our lifestyle breastfeeding wasn't worth the hassle. So we formula fed, and our daughter is healthy and wonderful and I do not nor will I ever regret not breastfeeding her. It was the best choice for our family.\n\nEdit:  You may not get a lot of answers from people who actually haven't tried.

She was a healthy \"near term\" baby, weighing 7lbs 6oz at birth, and no, my dates were not incorrect nor did I have GD.  My OB said she did me a solid by coming a month early.\n\nShe mimicked a healthy full-term newborn--no blood sugar issues, no respiratory problem, no NICU time, went home with me after 48 hours.  But she did have a couple \"hidden\" issues, one of them being a very lazy/weak suckle.  Her latch was great.  But she'd suck for a minute, get some colostrum on her tiny tummy, get tired, and fall asleep.  My body wasn't told \"THIS BABY IS HUNGRY MUST PRODUCE MILK\". \n\nLooking back, I should have pumped, but the hospital nurses and even the LC's never mentioned anything but \"keep trying, keep her at the breast\".  So I did.  For 10 days while I waited for my mature milk to come in.  She'd get a little here and there.  Her pediatrician was still optimistic and so were the LC's I saw.  We could still rock this. \n\nHer weight kept dropping.  Finally, when she hit 6 pounds, her doctor said that SOMETHING had to be done.  I realized that I had been letting my baby go hungry because I thought formula feeding made me a bad mother.  I was so determined not to give up, not to be lazy, that I almost hurt my baby.  I don't know if I'll ever get over that guilt. \n\nWe supplemented.  I had to return to work, and my mom watches her, so I pump.  I schedule it so that I'm either nursing her or pumping every 3 hours.  I do not respond well to the pump--I get about 2oz an hour.  Not enough to build up a stock, not enough to sustain her throughout the day when we're apart.  \n\nBesides her premature, weak suckle, there turned out to be other issues.  I found out later that I have insufficient tissue to produce a full supply of milk due to a breast reduction I had about 10 years ago.  My breasts are still comparatively large--I didn't even know that  \"insufficient tissue\" was a possibility for me.\n\nI will try my damndest to try to give my next baby exclusive breastmilk.  Maybe he/she will be full term, with a super suckle, and my boobs will start flowing like whitewater rapids.  One can only hope. \n\nShe's probably 50/50 formula and breastfed.  I hated myself for it at first.  I was NOT going to be lazy, I was going to do the best thing for my baby.  Turns out, the best thing for your baby is feeding them--by whatever means necessary.
