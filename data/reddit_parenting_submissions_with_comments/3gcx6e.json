I also still have my old friends and while I'm not going out every night of the week the odd times I do get out I appreciate so much. My social life is different, not over. I was quite lucky during pregnancy that I really didn't gain that much weight at all, mind you, I threw up if I ate anything in a large quantity at all. I basically had about 6 tiny meals a day. With help from breastfeeding I got back into my old clothes in a snap. I'm actually thinner now 10 months later than I was before thanks to being so busy all day running around minding a baby! Financially, I actually feel that while things are still tight it is so much easier to budget. I don't know how to explain it. Since having my son I just don't find myself spending money frivolously. I used to be such an impulsive buyer but I don't know, a baby popped out and a bit more sense popped in! \nBeing fit will make being pregnant, giving birth, recovering from giving birth and surviving a baby so much easier. That's the main tip. Don't read everything you see on the internet and if you must don't believe it. I spent countless sleepless night terrifying myself while pregnant reading about the horrors of childbirth but actually ended up having a very fast and easy birth.
