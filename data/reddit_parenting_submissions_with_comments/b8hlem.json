Of course at first it was more \"helping\" than actual helping.\n\nShe's 3 now.\n\nThings she has been able to do for a while: hand me pegs when hanging the washing, put ckothes i have unpegged into the basket, push the badket of clean clothes into the house (I'm not allowed to do this anymore it's her job), storing clean clothes into mummy's pile, daddy's pile, her pile, setting the table (well taking the cutlery, plates etc i hsnd her and putting them on the table), taking dirty dishes from table to sink, washing up non-breakable non-sharp things, helping to make the bed, choosing her clothes, getting dressed, holding the shopping list, placing groceries in the trolley, marking them off the list (can't read so i have to tell her which one it is), scanning things at the self checker, paying with the credit card, ordering coffee and a treat for us.\n\nPutting away her own toys is hit and miss but is has been a requirement for the past year. She often needs prompting and i need to help but she does it.\n\nLooking at the list of stuff she does might seem like a lot of chores for a 2 year old but she enjoys it. In fact her favorite games are shopping with her toy groceroes and her toy cash register and coffee shop also with the toy cash register and the toy kitchen, sometimes the coffee shop lady has to go shopping when i order my pretend coffee.", "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "created_utc": 1554235857, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "ejz1371", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_b8hlem", "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_b8hlem", "permalink": "/r/Mommit/comments/b8hlem/at_what_age_did_your_children_start_helping_out/ejz1371/", "retrieved_on": 1554235858, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"approved_at_utc": null, "author": "bclayton5", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_poo5ezv", "author_patreon_flair": false, "banned_at_utc": null, "body": "It really is amazing!
