I'll disagree with that. It's not a very good seat. In general, 3 in 1 seats (rear facing, front facing then booster) are usually not very good. The Evenflo Symphony is the only exception, and even that is only a good option for short to average height kids (because it can only be used rear facing when the head rest is in the lowest 2 positions).\n\nBritax are nice seats, but they are a bit shorter compared to other seats. This makes them nice for small cars and short-average height kids though. They are overpriced for what they offer, in my opinion. You can get a less expensive seat that can be used rear facing for longer.\n\nIn my opinion, the best choices for high weight and height limits are the Diono Radian, Safety 1st Complete Air 65 (Babies R Us now has a Complete Air 70, which is basically the same), Graco Size4me 70 (aka known as the Mysize 70 at Babies R Us) and the True Fit (this is a tall seat but only has a 35 lb rear facing weight limit, so it is best for tall kids that are skinny or average weight). The rest of these seats have 40 or 45 lb limits. \n\nIf you go to a Babies R Us store, they will allow you to take display car seats out to your car so you can try installing them to make sure they fit and you like them before buying. They don't carry the Diono Radian and maybe not the True Fit either, but should have the rest I mentioned. Also, once you decide on a seat, shop around online for sale prices. For example, Albeebaby.com has the Complete Air 65 in the Montross color for $129.99 right now (free shipping and no tax). \n", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1357761362, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "c7tz4j8", "link_id": "t3_1695xf", "parent_id": "t3_1695xf", "retrieved_on": 1430907955, "score": 4, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"archived": true, "author": "Talbotgirl247", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "I am in the same situation.

This can happen with just about any seat, but seems to be more prevalent with the AO seats.\n\nAs a belt positioning booster, it just doesn't do it's job well (positioning the seatbelt properly) for most kids.\n\nMy sister had one and replaced it after a year because it had gotten so difficult to adjust the harness and the straps were constantly twisting.\n\nI also know people who have it and love it....but it's really unlikely they won't still need at least a belt positioning booster once the seat expires.\n\nI mostly dislike the seat because it's misleading.  If you buy it for a newborn, it's likely not to fit them well, and the seat will likely expire before they reach the booster stage anyway.  If you buy it later then you're still likely to have to get a belt positioning booster once they outgrow the harness because it fails to position the belt properly.", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1357780116, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "c7u5ems", "link_id": "t3_1695xf", "parent_id": "t1_c7u4y49", "retrieved_on": 1430910973, "score": 2, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"archived": true, "author": "cassieniccole", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "My son has been in his Radian since he was 8 months old.
