When they answered yes then that was the end of the discussion.  THIS ISN'T ENOUGH!!!  if a woman has PCOS, is a first time mom, is AMA, or you know will need a C section it would be SO helpful from my end if they are old that these issues may delay the onset of lactogenesis and therefore MAY require supplementation until her milk comes in.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) Marijuana use: OMG this is so common and we have so many women who use both for recreation and therapeutically.  The AAP does not recommend breastfeeding while using marijuana because THC concentrations in breast milk are pretty high (lipophilic substance, etc.) and the developing brain is also lipophilic so presumably the THC will go in high quantities to a rapidly developing brain.  We know TCH is bad for brain development in teenagers and while there is no direct evidence of this issue in infants it would stand to reason it probably isn't great for it's development.  I really don't care if women choose to smoke weed but they should know that it isn't recommended and if they plan to breastfeed they should abstain from use just as they would from other illicit substances.

I had some  little \u201cbaby blues\u201d early on with worries or some tears but nothing that I didn\u2019t have with my first. I am an RN (although nothing do to with this subject) and thank goodness I knew something wasn\u2019t right. I know I waited to long and didn\u2019t see it right away. \n\nWhen I called my OBGYN their reply to the crying woman was that they recommend I try a counselor and if they thought I needed meds they would write them. I replied that I NEEDED to be seen by them that day and maybe they would go ask my primary person there, an amazing NP who I have a history with. She told them that if I said I needed to be seen she would see me that day whenever I got there and that she was there till x time and if that didn\u2019t work she would come on the phone to figure out a time. As I said, she\u2019s amazing. \n\nWhen she walked in the office I literally couldn\u2019t even get a word out. I just cried. She assured me I was going to be okay, and that I wasn\u2019t crazy. (I\u2019m tearing up right now). I almost quit my job, that I love. I was walking around the grocery store sobbing for no damn reason. I was not suicidal but I thought everyone would be better off if I drove away and never came back. I even knew at the time it was irrational if I thought about it but I couldn\u2019t think straight.\n\nPost partum doesn\u2019t make sense. And it doesn\u2019t only occur within a few weeks of the baby. If you were fine with one kid, it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll be fine with the next. \n\nIt is not talked about enough. A few questions at the 6 week or whatever check up isn\u2019t enough. The front desk staff needs to be educated on the seriousness of it when someone calls in. I honestly think if they said call a counselor and I didn\u2019t get in quickly I may have continued deeper in my spiral downward and maybe could have been suicidal, which scares the hell out of me. \n\nI was started on medication, I tried counseling but honestly the counselors I tried didn\u2019t help. I tried a few, I wanted to get better ASAP. They didn\u2019t know enough about PPD. I couldn\u2019t make the PPD group counseling sessions cause they wouldn\u2019t fit with my schedule and were only once every month. Counselors/therapists need to be educated. \n\nI got through this because I opened up to my husband and my mom and all of my friends and I leaned on them. I let myself need everyone else. I started working out. \n\nMy son is now two and a half. This still brings tears to my eyes as my darkest time in my life. I still feel guilty - I had two perfect kids, an amazing husband, a house, food, a job ... but I just wasn\u2019t me.

Whenever I walk into a room to talk to new moms one of my first questions is how feeding is going.  So many women give me a look like they are breaking inside and I always have to give them my talk.  We talk about how natural doesn't mean easy.  That breastfeeding is just a bodily function and sometimes our bodies don't work the way we want them to. That every nipple, breast, baby's mouth and baby's musculature is different.  That a drop of formula or a bottle or a years worth of formula will not ruin a baby.  That a happy mother who loves her child is so much more important than breastfeeding (if mental health is becoming a problem). That if you walk into a college classroom you can't tell who was breastfed and who wasn't.  That I bet they don't care how their mother fed them. That I was exclusively formula fed and I turned out OK.  Basically I am just giving them permission to not feel guilty because the mom guilt is REAL.  And it isn't just in breastfeeding.  I had a C section for failure to progress after a textbook pregnancy and I honestly couldn't care any less about that, but the looks I get of SYMPATHY when I tell someone I had a C section-it's as if I said my mother died!!.  I know so many women feel that if they don't have a vaginal unmedicated birth they have ALREADY failed as mothers!  Having discussions throughout pregnancy that pregnancy can be dangerous, that interventions are necessary sometimes, that our best laid plans are just that and we cannot will our bodies to do the things we WANT them to.

My baby slept A LOT and like 6 hours after he was born a nurse came in and asked if I had filled out the feeding chart and when I didn't she got mad at me, like I should have known? Nobody had explained how often the baby needed to eat, I figured if he was sleeping then he was fine and when he cried he needed to eat. I didn't know what my milk coming in was supposed to feel like, either. He sorta sucked on me and I figured he was getting what he needed, but when we took him in for his checkup a couple of days later he had lost like a third of his body weight and everyone freaked out. We ended up having to set an alarm and use a cold washcloth to wake him up and feed him every three hours. He was all right, and I didn't really feel the danger at the time, but in retrospect it scares the crap out of me. I don't think my milk came in for a couple of days and in the meantime he basically got nothing. What if he had gone to sleep and never woken up because his little body didn't have enough fuel? Even once he was okay, breastfeeding was a mess and I got mastitis a couple of times. I tried everything, and I still have no idea what I was doing wrong.\n\nMy second birth, my daughter was stillborn. Again, lactation was the main issue. I didn't have a baby so I just got sent home with nothing - a nurse pulled me aside as I was packing up and told me to wrap myself with ace bandages as tightly as I could. So that's what I did, which turned out to be the exact wrong thing to do. My milk came in, of course I got mastitis, and was in a ton of pain for a week. \n\nSo yeah, overall I feel like there needs to be a lot more information on how breastfeeding works and what you need to do with an infant in the first few days. These days they want to kick you out of the hospital ASAP, so they need to really educate you for what to expect between going home and the first appointment.

At both calls, they also reiterated that I could call with any questions at any time, and make an appointment before 6 weeks if needed.\n\nFor me, the unexpected and informal phone call was much better than an in person visit. I was doing well and not really having any issues, and really would not have wanted to deal with the logistics of what to do with the baby so I could go to another appointment in the harsh New England winter.

My daughter was born on a Friday and we were discharged on a Monday so I was told a lot of resources were just not set up on the weekend which was surprising as it's a major hospital for deliveries. I didn't truly get help until I was crying on the phone with a person who was doing a general phone survey following up a couple days later and she got me an appointment the next week with a LC who was helpful and taught me how to hold my breast and informed me I have a long torso so I needed a better pillow, etc. Until then the hospital (while still checked in) just told us it wasn't going to work and to give formula.\n\nAlso I wasn't educated on colic. My daughter had severe colic and again we went to every class and all we got was a brochure and video on Purple crying. No one believed us that it was something more. We often were told \"babies cry\" but I had been a nanny to an extremely difficult preemie and never seen this. Even my family didn't believe us until a visit. I still don't know what to do better and it was the worst 9 months for my husband and I.

I had a horrible infection after kid#2 and almost died. Mostly because I was so focused on caring for my newborn that I rationalized away all the serious symptoms. I was septic when I finally went to the ER. And unfortunately this happens way too often. I'm sure you're familiar with ProPublica's series on maternal mortality in the U.S. - those stories ring close to home.\n\n2) Self care: What new moms should feel ok doing. Like it's really ok to let your baby scream so you can shower, if there's nothing wrong then some babies are difficult. It's not that we're just shitty at momming when our friend Susan's baby just sits there looking angelic and sleeps 13 hours/night. Susan just won the baby lottery.\n\n3) Dad's Important Role: It's important for dad to spend time as a caregiver to bond with the baby. (Or mom's partner, of course.) A lot of moms are super nervous about this and feel like society expects us to be #1 caregiver. But it's important to let dad or partner play an equal role from the start. Plus, the more we do it, the less anxiety we'll feel when we do it. Bringing this up might also tip off the discussion about post partum anxiety, or any possible abuse in the home.\n\n4) Weight loss: I would have loved for my doctor to tell me that breastfeeding can make some women hold onto extra pounds, how long the loose skin hangs around, that having wider hips/ribs/feet is normal for several months or over a year or forever, and what is most important (in order: sleep, eating right, exercise).\n\n5) Brain/body changes: I'd love for my OB to look me in the eye and tell me that yes, my brain has changed and no, it's not changing back. I will now have superpowers like knowing exactly where everything is and remembering 20 million things related to my kids but I'll forget what I came upstairs for. I'll have to pee, all the time, and might even pee myself a little when dancing or trampolining. What is normal and what isn't.\n\n6) Please, PLEASE warn moms about the dangers of 'holistic medicine' - essential oils and 'natural supplements' and stuff like that. DO talk about when to see a doctor and how to research whether a product is kosher. For some reason it's moms who fall for this stuff more than anyone. \n\nThanks for doing this!! Lastly, I'd highly recommend to your patients that Dad (or their partner) comes to the post partum appointments too. You can certainly dismiss the partner when you need mom solo, but the partner also responsible for caring for mom, especially in the early stages of healing.

I wish they would\u2019ve allowed her to go to the nursery so I could\u2019ve slept. I was worried about her eating and just kept trying to breast feed her all the time. My husband finally went and bought some formula so we could give it to her because she was screaming. She just wasn\u2019t getting enough. My milk hadn\u2019t come in yet and she needed supplementation. They didn\u2019t give her any sweetums or a pacifier or anything when they drew her blood and it was awful. Because I knew they could. I felt they were stingey with resources. \n\n\nI also suggest if a patient has lost a child that more measures are taken to provide them with help and more chances to check on their baby. My first OB talked on the phone with me for an hour after she heard about our son. She was going to let us monitor our 2nd baby more. She knew I needed that to keep my anxiety levels down. But when we moved they wouldn\u2019t do it for me. It was hard. \n\nAlso, after my delivery my doctor noticed a large cyst on my groin. About the size of a plum. She removed it right after I had the baby. They prescribed me a 3 day supply of norco. I was in so much pain from the cyst removal I almost went to the ER for pain relief because they told me they wouldn\u2019t prescribe me more medicine. I remember standing in our bedroom crying and shaking telling my husband I couldn\u2019t make it another day like that. It was horrible. I was in so much pain for two weeks. I think that contributed to a lot of my problems. You trust your doctors to take care of you and also care about you and when they don\u2019t you feel betrayed and helpless. Every time I showered it felt like the incision was on fire. \n\n\nI already think you\u2019re a wonderful OB for doing what you\u2019re doing right now. I can\u2019t believe  some OBs can be so detached from their patients. \n\n\nUltimately more time-based help. Make us feel safe and protected by you. Make us feel that you care about our children and their well-being in relation to us. Help us on the front end.  Provide things that allow us to not have to worry for just a few days after going home. Research bottle types and styles and why they are best as well as formulas and tell moms about the options. Research diapers. And tell parents what you\u2019ve found with each type. I can\u2019t tell you how helpful that would be. \n\nThank you for your passion for your field and for your patients. I can only hope my future OB cares as much as you- because I definitely won\u2019t be seeing my last OB.

When your breasts are engorged there\u2019s basically more milk in them than they can comfortably hold, and you should relieve engorgement by pumping or feeding. Letting your breasts stay engorged increases your risk of getting a clogged milk duct, which feels like a small lump. If you get any clogs, you should move quickly to resolve them within a day or so. [insert helpful resource suggestions here] Sometimes you can develop clogs without being engorged first, so check your breasts often for lumps. If clogs aren\u2019t cleared out they can develop into mastitis, which is a breast infection that requires a lot more focused treatment. If you\u2019re still struggling to clear a clog, or you have a lump that isn\u2019t going away, give me a call.
