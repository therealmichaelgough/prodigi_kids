I hated the idea of it immediately.. it felt like it would rob me of something far too precious to share... rocking is tolerable but carying my baby against her in my wrap is just way too much for me ... Is my reaction normal ? \n\nI also have some trouble sleeping if she is too far from me... my husband wanted to give me a break yesterday evening so I could sleep alone a while and I ended up not falling asleep until he brought her back in the room with me... \n\nJust to be clear though, I dont mind my husband having her as long as he wants though... Just people outside of us I guess? \n\nMy inlaws will also visit soon for one week and I anticipate it a lot...

Just a 20 minute errand. Don't push yourself, but don't let those feelings chain you to your child either. It's really easy for us mom's to lose perspective and become entirely devoted to our kids. But I think as long as your bond with your child is strong and she feels safe and loved, a little space doesn't hurt (I mean this more for when your child is getting older, right now she's a baby and you're absolutely fine to be completely obsessed!)  My youngest is 5 and a half and he's definitely the clingiest child of my three. My oldest was super independent and easy. My second was/is an anxious kid, but not super clingy, just worried with lots of questions. He really went more to his sister for support (she's only 11 months older then him). My third is a total momma's boy. Sometimes when he's getting super clingy and I need to get stuff done I say \"buddyman, I love you,truly, but I need you to love me a little less right now\" and he just smiles and grabs my hand and says \"I just want to be with yoOoOoUuu\". And a big chunk of me wants to just let it be that way and let him be my baby forever, but he starts school this year and encouraging it isn't really doing him any favors. So I put some gentle boundaries in place to get him used to functioning in a world where I'm not with him 24/7... And that's the hard part, sussing out when it's time to let go a little, but trying to keep perspective that this time doesn't last forever. I think balance and consistency are the most important things to keep in mind.

As they get older it's necessary to let them spend time apart from Mom and Dad. My first born would cry if her dad and I weren't with her. We had made our schedule so that he worked days, I worked nights and I wouldn't work on days he had class. So when it happened that we both had to be away from her for work she freaked out. She cried the entire time and wouldn't eat. She was with Grandma and Grandpa who she knew very well but nobody could console her. She was about 9 months old at the time. We worked hard not to leave her alone after that just because of the difficulty it would cause for anyone watching her. \nIt took a long time to get her comfortable leaving us. Eventually my ex and I separated so she had to get used to a new schedule. I met my husband, got married a few years later, had another baby and I made sure to give her more integration into people. Having people over to watch her while I rested or did other things for small periods of time. She didn't have separation issues besides the normal dropping off at daycare the first few times. She's still safe around strangers but she was way more comfortable going to the store with Grandma or leaving with her Aunts. \nLol rambling on but the point is, it's fine to be protective and possessive of your baby but just be careful not to hurt yourself and the baby in the process. Remember to take breaks and have regular exposure to people who might help take care of your baby. \n", "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "created_utc": 1532904933, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e39e2k3", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_92uu2m", "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t1_e395u3s", "permalink": "/r/Mommit/comments/92uu2m/just_had_my_little_girl_dont_feel_like_sharing/e39e2k3/", "retrieved_on": 1532904933, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"approved_at_utc": null, "author": "soawhileago", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "banned_at_utc": null, "body": "I just walked over and said, \"let me see this baby\" and took them back.

My first birth was supposed to be unmedicated vaginal. I ended up with an emergency c-section after 22 hours of mostly unmedicated labor. After recovery and getting to hold my son for the first time, I still felt like I needed to have a baby. I developed HORRIBLE postpartum depression. For a month or so I felt like I needed to have a baby. I was also petrified of him not being close because I was anxious he would die in his sleep or something. \n\nC-sections do have a higher rate of PPD and PPA. Also know that there is emotional healing involved when you get one and things don't go according to birth plan. You sound as if you are doing really well with the support of your husband. If it becomes debilitating, speak to your doctor. \n\nBut also know that you do not owe anyone an explanation for why you want your child back. Guess what? They didn't make that baby, they didn't carry it to term, and they certainly didn't birth the baby. These people are also not the parents/sole caregivers of this child and for them it's more of a novelty \"I'm holding a baby! Look how adorable!\" and then hand them off while being able to go home and get sleep-- so them being butthurt about how you feel as a first time mom is a little low on the scale of things to be worried about. **You are the parent and your word is law.**\n If MIL wearing baby bothers you, tell her no. She can hold the baby and rock it, but baby wearing IS intimate. I personally wouldn't let my in-laws wear my month old baby and I'm on my 3rd. \n\nYour feelings are valid. Sit down with your husband and think of scenarios that might arise and how you feel about it.
