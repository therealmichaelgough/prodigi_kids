Thanks to all your questions and suggestions that I do an AMA, here I am to answer all your questions about language and reading development, starting from the first ba-ba-ma's to learning multiple languages! \n\nI'm half way through my doctoral work, studying the relationship between the written word and how it directly influences certain mental states in people, like anger, empathy, memory retention, etc. Starting from 6 months in utero, the human fetus can hear language as distinct sounds and begins to learn their parent's accents! Their first babbles are already influenced by the dominant language heard around them. And they understand words, long before they can speak them! So how do you know your baby is on track? When should you be worried or push for evaluation? What kind of words are most useful to teach first? When are their brains ready for certain ideas, like feelings and emotions? \n\nI know for myself, my research helped me as a parent, to not stress about some things, to facilitate my children's verbal and reading development, and to make my life waaay easier! So if you have any questions about how the brain actually works when it's learning to talk and read, what's a normal developmental phase for your child, and if your kid is ever going to start saying something comprehensible, ask away! \n\nPlease post your questions and I'll be live from 1 - 3 p.m. CST to chat and answer! I'm so happy to have a chance to give back to this special community. This place was my happy place during my first pregnancy and when I was figuring out what the heck to do with my baby now that she was born! Thank you for that!\n\nEdit: Okay, I spent WAY more time on this than I intended - kudos to my lovely husband who took the kids for the afternoon! Thank you all for your questions, I really enjoyed this. Feel free to keep posting questions, I'll check back every once in a while for a few days and try to get to you all.

[In many parts of the world, it\u2019s impossible *not* to raise your child multi-lingually.]( http://www.mnn.com/lifestyle/arts-culture/stories/9-of-the-worlds-most-multilingual-countries) For example, in India, you learn your local dialect, maybe the one from the neighbouring state, and then Hindi and English. So to put you at ease, raising a bilingual child will not delay them developmentally at all. This is actual a very normal thing for humans to do. You can both go back and forth as much as you can. There is no rule for the brain that one object can only be connected to one group of sounds. If you introduce that fact that one object is simply called two different sounds and both work equally well, your child will unquestioningly learn that. There is no need to translate one language through another.\n Is there a language that will be the \u201cdominant\u201d one in the future? For example, is she going to be surrounded mostly by English speakers and have to go to school/work/career in English? If this is the case, once both languages have been established and the child is in English school, I recommend mostly using the \u201cless important\u201d language at home, to ensure that both are kept up. As she gets older, be sure to specifically introduce her to the stories, art, history, and culture of the less-used language, to ensure that many connections between language and the world around her are made in the brain. The stronger and bigger the web of neural connections between the language and the things she sees and experiences is, the more likely she\u2019ll keep the connection to the language.\nReading is absolutely one of the best things you can do for her. Do you have any bilingual Spanish/English books for children?  \n[This is one of my favorite resources for bilingual parents]( http://www.linguisticsociety.org/resource/faq-raising-bilingual-children) Feel free to PM me if you have any questions that this webpage can\u2019t answer for you! \n", "created_utc": 1483901580, "id": "dc5y8kf", "link_id": "t3_5mr7wr", "parent_id": "t1_dc5s3tv", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3", "url": "http://www.linguisticsociety.org/resource/faq-raising-bilingual-children"}, {"author": "ZenMommy", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "Both my children have December birthdays too! Your child\u2019s babbling is her trying to communicate, which is great! Does she point, gesture, or use her hands/body to help talk if, for example, she wants something specific? What is important to consider is not so much if she is *talking*, but if she is *communicating*. I\u2019m happy to hear you\u2019ve made an appointment already. If there is a problem, it\u2019s important to begin therapies as soon as possible. The younger a brain is, the easier it is for them to make new neural connections, changing old habits and learning new ones. \nNow, it\u2019s difficult to predict whether or not your child may have a temporary or permanent delay. It\u2019s about a 50/50 chance either way. The reason for this is that there are SO many factors involved, including the reasons for the delay, and significantly, the parents\u2019 involvement in addressing it. You\u2019re already doing the best thing you can do by getting her that appointment. Day-to-day, I just encourage you to read a lot, keep her screen time super minimal, and play with her as much as possible. When we are playing and having fun, our brains light up like fireworks, and we\u2019re absorbing information very intently. Playing is the most natural form of learning! With my own children, while I do babble like a maniac, narrating everything as I go, I also, especially when they are less than 2 years old, took the time to listen to their babbling. In order for them to want to talk, they need to feel like people like to listen to them. \nWhen narrating or just talking about an activity you are doing, try not to focus on objects as much as what you think she\u2019s experiencing with her body and senses. For example, the playdough feels smooth, soft, and squishy. The colour is less important than what she feels, because what she is feeling is the dominant sensation in this experience. Singing, dancing, blowing bubbles, making silly faces together, etc. are all fun ways of learning to communicate and exercising mouth and face muscles, which helps bring attention to them.\nAnecdotally, my husband was a slow talker. He didn\u2019t really say much before his 3rd birthday. He\u2019s terrifyingly brilliant and makes medical robots for brain surgery now. Turns out, he was just really taking everything in and thinking very hard about it!\n[Check out this article by Rhea Paul.

Building sentences is not something that happens all at once, but incrementally.

Me!), the grammar starts to kick in as they notice patterns in other people\u2019s speech, and they eventually end up with \u201cMy good sir, if it is not an inconvenience, may I trouble you to hand me that ball?\u201d\n\n What is important is that he is on this learning spectrum, headed towards increased complexity. Developing sentences is a skill that begins to develop around 18 months in early talkers. By 24 months, we should see some small combinations happening, and by 2.5 years, things that sound like sentences but can still be totally grammatically incorrect. I\u2019m wondering if it wouldn\u2019t benefit him to hear you both say long sentences to each other in whatever his dominant language is. Reading together is super important.

I\u2019m going to use the example you describe with your daughter, because I was making the same mistakes. The goal is \u201ccommunication\u201d. So your daughter gets an A+ for wanting something, figuring out how to make you understand it, and then getting it! But wait! There\u2019s a trap! First, before she can get the thing that she wants and has communicated successfully about, she has to pass a test and make her mouth say \u201cmilk\u201d.

Keep the whole experience positive and fun. I bet you that within a few weeks of changing how you interact verbally with her, she\u2019ll start spontaneously opening up and using her words more. If she feels like it\u2019s stressful and important, and like there\u2019s a test to pass before she gets what she wanted, she\u2019ll shut down much faster, as her little nervous system quickly gets overwhelmed at this age.  \nYour daughter sounds like a very smart, determined little person! \n", "created_utc": 1483901722, "id": "dc5ycx8", "link_id": "t3_5mr7wr", "parent_id": "t1_dc5ryk5", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"author": "[deleted]", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "[removed]", "created_utc": 1483901791, "id": "dc5yezf", "link_id": "t3_5mr7wr", "parent_id": "t1_dc5rh26", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"author": "ZenMommy", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "This is perfectly normal at this age, and you are doing exactly what you should be doing.

I was raised German-English bilingual as well, and with a father who speaks German and a mother who speaks English! It would be fun and helpful for you to learn German along with your daughter, but if you want her to learn both languages, both need to be spoken. At all costs, please avoid \"correcting\" the languages. All the brain needs to know is that THING or object over there (like this table for example) can be referrred to using two different groups of sounds (table and Tisch). The brain is perfectly capable of learning this. After all, language is full of synonyms! It's important that the learning process remains fun and interesting. There should be no hint of \"correcting\" English to German or the other way. That will just make her feel like she's doing something wrong, and delay her learning. \n\nIf you both keep steadily interacting with her in both languages in a positive way, with lots of books and games in both languages, she will gain a foundation in both languages. This is exactly the stage you want her in, until about 4 years old, where the brain will natrually begin to categorize and seperate the languages to increasing degrees. \n\n[Here's a pdf from McGill University on raising bilingual children](http://www.psych.mcgill.ca/perpg/fac/genesee/A%20Short%20Guide%20to%20Raising%20Children%20Bilingually.pdf) and a great one from [the Linguistic Society of America](http://www.linguisticsociety.org/sites/default/files/Bilingual_Child.pdf) that may answer some of your questions. \n\nFeel free to PM me if you have anything else specific to ask!

We live in an area of Canada that is majority English, so common language outside the home and mostly within the home is English with the exception of my husband speaking to her in only French.\n\nDespite all of that, she has been an early talker. She had her first word (a French word - chat) at 10 months, had about 12 words by 1 year old and now at 18 months probably about 60 over both languages (I stopped counting) and has started putting together simple sentences (2 and even the occasional 3 word sentence). She has a handful of signs as well we started at around 6 months she still uses, now in conjunction with the word as well. She will say \"eat\" and also do the eat sign at the same time.\n\n*The con is she has already started to talk back with some sass so don't be too jealous!!*\n\nI guess my question is even tough she is being raised bilingually (although not 50/50 by any stretch, more like 80/20) her language hasn't been delayed at all, quite the opposite. Is this common, or unrelated to the second language? Gut feeling, she is just focusing on social and language as a priority for her. She was a late crawler (9 months) walked late-normal (13 months) and still isn't climbing on furniture or anything at 18 months (still crawls up stairs/doesn't use her feet, goes backwards down the stairs, etc.)\n\nSecondary question, how can I keep encouraging her language development? I talk to her and she loves books, but it seems like the words she is learning are really just words she is most interested in learning. Example as chat as her first word (cat) she loves the kitties!\n\nAlso, I saw your answer to Antiserra about pronunciation and we have the same issue and approach it in a similar way, repeat the word back to her correctly but not indicating it was wrong.

The most relevantt information is going to be in the first 1/3 of the book, I suspect. \n\nSolid research into actual brain development is just beginning to take off, now that we finally have the tools and technology to see inside the brain and find out if our 1000s of theories are actually true. I'm actually very frustrated with the lack of accessible books explaining to parents without neuorology degrees, just what's actually happening in the children's brains and what they are ready for. \n\nNow I can give you an unprofessional summary, gathered from 100s of articles of approximately what's up in your children's brains right now:\n\nThey are going off like *fireworks*. Imprortantly, their emotional abilities are growing by leaps and bounds (hello tantrums!), as they learn that they can *want* something, as well as *need* something. So they can learn the difference between need and want, even though that's a tough one. They are very ready to put words to all those facial expressions they see on people's faces. Mirror neurons are strongly actively, causing their brains and bodies to directly reflect their environments, so they are ready to have the seeds of empathy planted. We play a game we call \"statues\" with our children, where we say \"happy face!\" and make an exagerated happy face. (Or sad, angry, surprised, waiting, goofy, etc.) The kids have a great time making silly faces, and learn to pay attention to other people's faces and feelings, as well as their own. \n\nI'm sorry, I wish I had better resources to point you towards. I find it so frustrating that I haven't been able to find a good developmental parenting book that actually goes through the phases of brain development and ties them to what our children are ready to learn.

The words she is learning are definitely the words that belong to the stuff she's interested in. This is the most natural and helpful mental state to be in when learning! The key here is, to not only encourage interest in the things she is already indicating that she likes, but to stretch that interest further. Your own excitement and interest are most important here. We are hardwired to notice that if someone else is interested in something and focussing on it, we should get right up in there and learn something too.  By stretching, I mean that from \"chat\" we can talk about fur, what is it, how does it feel, do we have fur? no we have skin! Cats have tails! Do we have tails? What other animals have tails?\n\nDo you see how I kind of built a context net, starting with CAT in the middle? This way, her interest is there naturally from the start, but now stretched to noticing interesting things about the cat, learning about differences, and then on to other animals with tails...and so on and so forth. \n\nDancing and singing are invaluable tools to help reinforce and expand language. Never be afraid to sing to your child, even if you sound like a drunk frog. Your voice is the very first and most primal connection your child has to language, and is the most beautiful sound for them.

Perhaps looking into a referral to a genetist would be worth it for you all. \n\nYour second question is a tough one, because this behaviour is strongly linked to personality. I have two minds about this. My daughter is very verbal, but also highly anxious, so she doesn't like to talk to people she doesn't feel mentally and emotionally connected to and comfortable with. If your son has a speech delay, there could be an added layer of stress to already stressful public interactions for him. I'd ask him first, at a different time, what talking to people he doesn't know feels like for him. You can pretend and play little scenarios, where he asks you questions that strangers have asked him, and you answer, and then switch roles. What's most important is that his stress and anxiety are reduced. Stress and speech are inextricably linked, as when we are stressed, our brain shuts down electrical and chemical activity in the lobes we need for communication, and activates the lower lobes and brain stem, left over from when we were all lizards. So we're good at fighting, fleeing and freezing (maybe what your son is doing), but not good at clearly communicating our thoughts through language. Stress also causes your breathing to rise into the top of your lungs, you breath through your mouth, your muscles in your face, jaw, and throat tighten, so it's not only neurologically difficult to talk, but straight up physically harder. \n\nPerhaps, just protect him right now, if strangers talk to him, and let him know that it's okay for him to not want to talk to them. I just ask my daughter \" Do you want to talk to the nice man, or would you like me to answer for you?\" As his confidence grows, he'll begin to want to say things on his own.  \n\n", "created_utc": 1483908285, "id": "dc63sqb", "link_id": "t3_5mr7wr", "parent_id": "t1_dc5x82p", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3", "url": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-8749.1990.tb16948.x/full"}, {"author": "elleandmia", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "Thank you so much for doing this AMA.

Sorry for the lenght, it's just that I feel a bit of backstory could help you help me :D.\n\nMy boyfriend is French speaking, but fluent in Japanese because his mother is japanese. I'm from France so french is my mothertongue, but I've been learning english since I was 3y.o at school, and lived in the states for a while. We live in Belgium, where it's important to speak French, Dutch, and good to know english. \n\n\nMy boyfriend really wants our son to know Japanese as it's his heritage, his name will be a japanese name, and I'm all for it. I've tried to learn japanese a bit, but besides really really REALLY basic things, I can't really hold a conversation. However, I can say easy things like \"Are you hungry?\" \"Does this taste good?\" and I have a little bit of vocabulary for like animals, fruits, vegetables.\n\nI on the other hand, would really like our boy to know english because of how useful it is in our current world. We watch all our movies in english, I read english books, I also think in english half if not more of the time. I'll switch to english half sentence if the french word doesn't come easily. My boyfriend understands english perfectly and speaks it, but has more of a \"just out of high school\" level with a heavy accent when he speaks it.\n\nBut with this, comes the fact that the primary language in our household is french. We speak to each other in french, our family (besides bf's mom) speaks french, the part of the town we live in is mostly french, and second language is dutch, which my boyfriend babbles a bit but I don't at all.\n\nI'm going to be a stay at home mom for at least 2 1/2y until my boy can go to school here. So I'll be the one mostly speaking to him.\n\n\n\nSo I was wondering, with our situation... Is it possible at all to \"teach\" all three languages to our son? I don't want my boyfriend to feel like his japanese heritage will be put aside just because I don't speak japanese much, and I feel he'd secretly be upset if our boy spoke more english words than japanese for example.\nTo that, we can add the fact that english is taught early in our schools, so I was wondering if we shouldn't just focus already on french and japanese, and help him out in english later when he'll learn it in school.\n\nDo you have any tips for this? some advice on how we could proceed?\n\nThanks so much in advance and sorry for such a lenghty comment :D.", "created_utc": 1483924130, "id": "dc6gwkm", "link_id": "t3_5mr7wr", "parent_id": "t3_5mr7wr", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"author": "ZenMommy", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "Alright. Speech is actually a pretty tough thing to do. Not a lot of animals communicate like we do, and *none* of them to the extent, depth, and significance that we do. This is a pretty new thing, evolutionarily, and it's perfectly normal for the brain to mess it up sometimes. \n\nI recommend checkout out the first 1/3 of Steven Pinker's \"How the Mind Works\". In these chapters, he lays out just how complicated it actually is for the brain to translate data received through the senses into a verbal expression. He also explains why sometimes, the wiring is wrong and you end up with speech delays or dyslexia, for example. So I want to reassure you that it's nothing you've done or haven't done, it's just because of our fancy, complicated brains. \n\nWhat I would do is call up the referring doctor, and push for your place on that list. Make the case that his lack of speech isn't just a language issue, it's hurting his ability to learn social skills, interact with people his own age and older, that people treat him differently than he should be treated because of his unintelligble speech, etc. You want to make a strong case that even if he's not an emergency, the effects of his speech delay are having ripple repurcussions across his life, which is now causing OTHER developmental issues. Now, I hope I haven't stressed you out by saying this; I just want to help you make the strongest case for your child and get him bumped up that last. \n\nI'll be honest, it is my unprofessional, non-diagnostic, personal opinion that you're right to be worried. A *little* worried. Keep pushing for the speech therapy, because the earlier you can start remedial therapies, the better. I'd also recommend lots of songs and rhymes that break up sound into discrete parts. Somewhere in this thread I linked Raffi's Apple and Bananas song as a good example of a song that breaks up sounds nicely. Clapping ryhmes are also good. When you repeat yourself, try breaking up the words into syllables, and stress the breaks between sounds sometimes. His brain might just need some help breaking the sounds apart, like when you listen to a language you don't know and it's just a stream of babbling sounds. Once you learn it, it's like it snaps into focus, and your brain starts dividing the stream into chunks of words. Everything you are doing is *great*, and exactly what I'd recommend if you weren't. \n\nHave all physical obstacles, like tongue tie and swollen tonsils and adenoids been ruled out?

I just want you to know that it's totally possible; it just depends on how much effort you and yoru husband are willing to put into it. \n\nI think I made this recommendation elsewhere, but one of the easiest ways of keeping a language in your life is by dedicating family time to it. So for example, you may make a tradition of picnicking under the cherry blossoms (harumi) in spring, and only speak Japanese or as much as you can manage while you celebrate. Or perhaps do a bedtime story in a different language every night. \n\nI suspect that if you're feeling overwhelmed , it would be totally okay to not stess about the English, because that will for sure be taken care of in the schools. So maybe keep the English exposure a little more low key, to make it easier on yourselves.

Almost the entire rest of the world is pretty multiplingual, so pediatricians in China, for example, are going to have a different metric. \n\nThe argument is still ongoing about multilingual children, and there are a number of reasons for this. What is \"normal\" language development? For some reaons, social scientists that usually run these studies tie language development to an arbitrary age range. This is silly, because we know that we can learn language at any age, and there are way more factors than age in play. What I look for is the learning process, and indications of where they are on it. So if a 2 year old child is in a multilingual environment, has a combined vocabulary of at least 30-40 words, is putting little 2-3 word phrases together, and generally communicating, they are on lthe learning spectrum, headed in the right direction, even if they mix up the languages and have no grasp of grammar. It can *look* like there are language delays in multilingual children, compared to monolingual, but that's because their brains are literally doing twice the work. In my opinion, those \"delays\" are worth it, because they do even out in the end, and you're left with a multilingual instead of a monolingual child, which is very healthy for the brain. \n\nThis is an interesting question though, and I admit that most of my research is carried out in English and German.

If that kid is bored and tries to climb your back while you're barfing instead, that sucks. TV does not teach language or vocabulary and will not help her speech development in any way.

Thanks so much for waiting!\n\nSo, I always recommend getting your child on that wait list, because on the off-chance that they *do* need a proper evaluation and therapy, the success rates are better the younger the brain is. However, one of the most important, determining factors in successful therapies is the role of the parents. The child obviously spends most of their time at home, so the home environment clearly very significant. \n\nRegression is always a not good sign, I'm sorry. If you haven't raised this with their pediatrician, I would do so immediately (or tomorrow morning, if their office is closed already.) Regression can be caused by a number of things, none of which I'm really qualified to talk about. He's still communicating and following directions, which means he's on the path of learning, which is great! Let's try to nurture that as much as possible. \n\nFor now, until you get proper assessments done, there are lots of fun things you guys can do together, apart from reading and narrating around him. \n\nBlowing bubbles, blowing those whirly toys, pushing a toy boat across a bowl of water, are all fun activities which activate the mouth and throat muscles. \n\nSinging and moving to music is *very* helpful. Language has its neural origins in music, and evolutionary linguists highly suspect that music came before language. Music and songs also help break words up into little pieces, and rhythm is an excellent tool to help the brain just get used to the sounds, to breaks in sounds, and to playing with sound. \n\nHelp him watch your mouth by positioning yourself in a way that's easy for him to see, while you are talking. \n\nHow is he with eating? Does he feed himself most of the time? Does he have any texture aversions? Is he social or interactive with other children at all? How is he with stimulation, like lots of things happening visually? Is he often overwhelmed, and if yes, when and how does he react?\n\nBecause regression is a factor here, I'm hesitant to suggest more intense therapeutic activities, because they may accidentally aggravate other neurological issues as well. I'm sorry, but I think your very best course of action is to get him thoroughly evaluated by a team of developmental specialists, ASAP. \n\nYou are ABSOLUTELY doing the right thing here. You've noticed an important issue, you care, and you're doing something about it. You're a caring, loving parent and in the end, those things matter more than anything else. Call his pediatrician, tell them that you've noticed a clear regression in verbal development in the last 2 months, and that this is not getting better. Push for an evaluation. Do NOT let them brush this away with an \"oh he's too young to evaluate\". There is evidence of a clear verbal regression here, which can indicate other serious problems. You need more than a speech therapist. \n\nI'm so sorry. I just want to give you a hug. I wish I could have said much nicer things for you to hear. As a parent, I know you definitely didn't want an answer like this. I took the time to do some research and see if there are comparable cases out there, and my recommendation to get him evaluated for developmental issues is the very best advice I can give. Perhaps you'll go through it all only for him to be perfectly normal, but you're still doing the right thing by getting it checked out. \n\n*Hugs*", "created_utc": 1484012248, "id": "dc81qp2", "link_id": "t3_5mr7wr", "parent_id": "t1_dc5xfbw", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"author": "ZenMommy", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "Based on what you describe, your daughter sounds right on target for her age.

There's an important difference between language and communication, so the fact that she's figured out ways of communication that are working for her right now is really good. Theoretically, their brains are just focusing on a different skill set at a different time. \n\nSo, because she's obviously a bright little thing, full of personality, I would recommend *against* teaching her more signs. You want her to focus on communicating verbally, with language, and not physically through signs. If you are signing to her still, I would begin to scale back and substitute *only* verbal communication, one word at a time. \n\nYou say she has about 15 words. At this stage of learning a language, she probably understands a good 80% more than she can say. Does she respond to words she doesn't say herself? Can you see that she understands more than she speaks?\n\nLots of reading, singing, clapping rhymes, rhythm and dance movements to music, and very restricted screen time will all help move her in the right direction. \n\nI'd definitely monitor her, and keep an eye out for any regressions, both in language use, and in overall communication. By age 2, you should be looking for a decent vocabulary of about 40+ words and little 2-3 words phrases. If you don't see development in that direction in the next few months, I recommend calling your pediatrician and getting an evaluation.

Knowing Germany (which I do), I don't recommend just leaving German to chance. The way people interact with her will be profoundly affected by her lack of German literacy and language skills, and this in turn will impact her sense of self and her social skills. In my own experience, simply having a slightly different German accent and having a slightly reduced vocabulary caused many people to treat me like I was mentally disabled, despite being very educated and speaking 5 other languages. I actually had to remind my boss that although I may sound stupid to her in German, I'm actually brilliant in several other languages, including ones she didn't speak. \n\nSo where does that leave you? Yes, your child would be totally capable of picking up all 4 languages.

Keep English as your \"secret parent language\" until she starts school (trust me, you'll want one by the time she's 18 months), and if you go with the OPOL system for French and Dutch, keep in mind that as your child grows older, you need to be careful to make your language and sentence structure more complicated. The one issue I have with the OPOL system, is that because the verbal interactions are not between adults, the child isn't exposed to sophisticated sentence structure and vocabulary, which artificially restricts their fluency at a more immature level. \n\nKeep in mind that learning languages is a life's work. So no worries if she picks up on Dutch really fast, but French seems to lag. Maybe in 15 years she'll do a semester in France, or go to university in an English speaking country, and better her language skills that way. What's important is that with early exposure to the various sounds and grammatical structures, her overall language skills are going to be facilitated in a way that just wouldn't happen if you were not giving her such a rich lingual environment.

Mouth breathing actually causes a different kind of electrical activity in the brain than breathing through the nose. It heightens the areas of the brain that respond to stress and distress, and signals stress hormones to be released in the body. A major component of successful speech and language learning is calmness, as a tight and taut throat, face, mouth, neck and shoulders make it physically difficult to speak. This can lead to a kind of negative feedback loop, where you are stressed so you can't speak, so you stress out more, and can't speak more, etc. \n\nI recommend trying to get her to mimic you doing nice big diaphragmatic breathing and some really easy yoga poses. My toddler has a blast doing these with me!
