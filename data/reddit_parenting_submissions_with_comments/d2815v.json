She has an abrupt manner that just doesn\u2019t sit well with me but before I had my daughter it was tolerable. My daughter is now 4.5 months old and I cannot stand her now. \n\nI do have my reasons although I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m being too hard on her. To start, she makes unwanted comments about my daughters appearance or style. She remarked that she\u2019s \u2018too young\u2019 for a double chin (I had a double chin even when I\u2019m underweight so there\u2019s a chance my daughter may always have one). My daughter is also in the 50-85th percentile for weight so perfectly average. \nI put small bows on my little girl as she has a lot of hair that I can\u2019t tie yet so I use them to style it. She always remarks about how she might not want ribbons and she might be a tomboy. She only buys her boyish clothes and clothes that match what she wears which I find weird. \n\nMost recently she\u2019s begun taking my daughter from me without asking. She\u2019ll come up and say my turn and then take her from my arms.

My baby, my rules.  \n\nAs far as the clothes go, I mostly let that slide. I didn't particularly care for the outfits  my MIL would buy my daughter, but if I didn't have to put her in those clothes if my MIL wasn't around. When they would visit, if my daughter needed a change of clothes, my MIL would volunteer to get her cleaned up and my daughter would come out in crazy outfits, but hey, I didn't have to clean up the blow out and vomit... seemed like a fair trade.

So at least now, I don't have to store ridiculously gaudy outfits anymore. \n\nMy MIL and I get along for the most part now.
