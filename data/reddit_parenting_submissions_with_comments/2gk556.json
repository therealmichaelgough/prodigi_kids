As someone whose family also brings home 6 figures, I can tell you that there is a lot of work you need to do to figure out where the leaks are. \n\nYour budget is absolutely the first thing you need to take care of. You need to look at every single penny that goes into your bank account, and then be watching where it goes when it leaves. So before anything, MAKE A BUDGET. Even if it is just in Excel or a Google Doc. It can take time to figure out - put aside a weekend to go through your bank statements or online account for, say, August. Plug every single expense in and see what you're looking at. I really can't stress doing this on paper enough - just thinking in your head, \"well we make X every month and A goes to this and B goes to that... we should have plenty left over\" is not going to cut it. \n\nOnce you know *where* money is going, you can start to control it. If you see that you are spending $300 a month on coffee, you can swap that out for a $10 canister of Folger's instead. If you already live what you consider a \"comfortable\" lifestyle (eating out, lots of alcohol in the house, new clothes and home goods every few months) it might be time to step back and lower expectations until you can get a full handle on this. The fact that you aren't willing to get rid of cable suggests to me that you may be living at \"comfortable and not willing to change.\" Living below your means is key, even if you make millions of dollars.\n\nMaybe no one is answering questions about saving for their kids future because they don't have the extra funds. Saving is not often part of the equation when you are living paycheck to paycheck. \n\nBut the tl;dr version is this: You want to know how others make it on $6k a month? It's because they would never say things like this:\n\n&gt; We are not willing to bake our own bread and cancel cable.\n\nYou will at some point have to start cutting. I can promise you right now that is your problem. Whether you cut out things that are unnecessary (cable) or go extreme and stop buying store-made goods (baking bread) is your choice. But you will need to make decisions on where to cut, and then start cutting.\n", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1410888055, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "ckk0ij9", "link_id": "t3_2gk556", "parent_id": "t1_ckk0503", "retrieved_on": 1426982976, "score": 8, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"archived": true, "author": "snuggleslut", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "Well, it really depends where you live, how big your house is, and how nice your car is.

If you cut back later, elsewhere, save some money, and pay back your debt in a timely manner. \n\nMy parents had over $30k credit card debt (at $80k/year) and it took work, but they paid it off. My mother stopped with her mindless mall trips, my dad stopped buying $30/lb fish on a whim, the house was refinanced, they chipped away at it. Debt is an avalanche toward rock bottom just waiting to build momentum. \n\nEdit: I reread this and realised I never really made my main point.

Came upon this via my Mommy half.  Hope my input is welcome.\n\nI imagine as professionals who each earn $150k a year, you're both savvy, intelligent people who can easily devise a sub-$150k budget for a household of four.  I think maybe the disconnect is that you're imagining your sahm neighbors are living the same lifestyle you are; they are not. \n\nYou've mentioned you're not interested in baking your own bread or cutting out cable, and that he's not willing to cut out Starbucks. Those are luxuries. No judgment here, you work hard for your money and should spend it as you see fit.\n\nBut.\n\nIf you want to decrease your household expenses by HALF, you'll need to cut a LOT of spending in ways you'll notice much more than missing your morning latte. It's tightening your belt for months to pay down your debt to get rid of that monthly credit payment. It's drastically changing your eating habits to cut your food costs.  It's possibly even downgrading your car or moving to a different home to cut costs there too. \n\nThe real question is if you would rather keep living a $250k lifestyle or if you'd rather be a sahm. Unless hubby can do something to drastically increase his income, you won't have both. \n\nWould you rethink baking your own bread if it meant the difference between being home w the kiddos or not?", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1411022197, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "ckllzuf", "link_id": "t3_2gk556", "parent_id": "t3_2gk556", "retrieved_on": 1426947740, "score": 2, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"archived": true, "author": "goldilockz", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "Wow. check out Dave Ramsey.
