I have no issues being a SAHM, but I do like my job (hate the company, like the work) and I\u2019m fearful about what kind of hit our retirement would take if I did that.

We started looking elsewhere when our oldest was getting older and found an even better daycare that was less expensive. \n\nReally think through all your options and what will make you happy.
