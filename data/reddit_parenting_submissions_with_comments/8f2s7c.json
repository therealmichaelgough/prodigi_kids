We live in a culture that talks all about the \"unconditional love\" between mother and child.  You see it, hear it, and are told how amazing the bond between the two of you will be.  How your motherly instincts will \"kick in\" at some point.  \n\nTHAT IS BULLSHIT!\n\nFor some women, sure, it's there.  But for the first few months of your child's life, they are a mewling infant begging for food, or sleep, or a new diaper.  They take and take and don't really give anything back at that point.  You're pouring everything you've got into caring for them and not reaping much benefit at the time.\n\nYou care for your son, which is great.  About a month into my son's life, my wife and I sat down and I talked to her.  She seemed out of it, she was getting more and more \"short\" with me and our son.  She was getting frustrated easily.  We talked about how she was feeling completely and totally overwhelmed, how she felt she was a bad mom because she didn't have that unconditional love, how she felt like she didn't necessarily love our son, but was just going through the motions day in and day out.  \n\nWe talked about how she was doing everything she could.  We talked about how love is something we all have to work at (even and especially within our marriage).  We talked about PPD and I suggested she go talk with her OBGYN.  She did, she got some support through conversation and medication and she started to feel better.\n\nMy son and her have a great bond now.  He's 3.  He can show love a lot more towards her now and could do so as he got older and older.  She started seeing her effort reciprocated from him and they started building a bond.\n\nMy advice; talk to your SO.  Share with him/her how you are feeling and be honest.  You need each other right now more than ever.  Talk to your doctor.  Share with them all your feelings and don't hide any way.  All of your feelings are valid right now and need to be discussed.  By sharing them and putting them out there, you can start to address them. \n\nIf you haven't yet, look around your town for some Mommy support groups.

I have 3 sons whom I love with my every breath but being pregnant and the work involved in the having kids part does a number on you...it truly does. You question whether or not this was a mistake, if you're cut out for it, etc. and don't properly bond other than going through the motions...and feel guilty about not being the mom in all the commercials. When they wake up crying at 4am you think about tossing them out the window for the first few months...or running away. It's normal.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWith my first son, it was 2 years and while I wasn't abusive, I was more neglectful - 19, no clue what the hell I was doing, and it was really easy to hand him off to my mom so I could still go out and be 19...but 2 years into it, due to my neglect and cluelessness - leaving him too long in wet/soiled diapers, not properly washing the bottles, etc. he ended up getting sick with bronchial pneumonia and was put into ICU for awhile to monitor his breathing. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI lay in the chair nearby falling asleep and having this revelation that I can't do this...I absolutely cannot cope...maybe it's for the best that he doesn't make it. I ended up falling asleep awhile later only to be awakened by the sound of a steady buzzing. I looked over and saw the flatline and it was literally that moment the Mother in me kicked in...I bolted up, checked on him, ran into the halls raising 12 kinds of hell to get someone in there NOW to fix it, save him, help him.  In that moment, I became Mamma Lioness protecting her cub and from that moment forward I was connected to my child. \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut if you think about LITERALLY tossing them out the window, or kick around plans and ways and means of doing it, or you hurt them, or look the other way - then there's a huge problem. That child trusts you to not throw him to the floor and stomp on his head because you have no self control. \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThat's the best litmus test - indifference is normal, bonding happens in time...but if you are actively seeking ways of getting rid of this child then you are a danger to him, the problem is you, and CPS needs to get him the hell away from you.", "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "created_utc": 1524767835, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dy0kw7m", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_8f2s7c", "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_8f2s7c", "permalink": "/r/Mommit/comments/8f2s7c/im_really_sorry_if_this_doesnt_belong_here_but_i/dy0kw7m/", "retrieved_on": 1524767837, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"approved_at_utc": null, "author": "yournotthebossofme21", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "banned_at_utc": null, "body": "Please talk to your doctor about ppd.
