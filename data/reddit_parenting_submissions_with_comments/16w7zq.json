I'm sobbing as I write this. I apologize in advance for the length (I want to give you all the details) and lack of fluency (I'm so sleep deprived I can no longer think straight.) \n\nMy baby girl is just shy of 6 months old. She has never been a  \"good\" sleeper. At 6-8 weeks she had a few 4 hour stretches (in a swing), but since then the longest stretch she has slept is 2-1/2 hours (rare). \n\nOn a nightly basis, she wakes up crying anywhere from 8 to 24 (yes 24) times, with the average being 12-16 times. She almost always requires nursing to go back to sleep for 2-10 minutes. Lately, around 2 a.m., she wakes up and is UP (not crying, just awake) for 1-1/2 to 3 hours!\n\nShe will only sleep in her travel system. I have had no luck getting her to sleep longer than a few minutes in her crib. I tried cosleeping for the first few months, but it was no better, and my husband never got any sleep. She and I have moved to the nursery with me on a cot next to her travel system.\n\nI read No Cry Sleep Solution and implemented many of the strategies but she just wakes up too many times to put a sleep plan in place. I would literally have to be up all night long. I really, really don't want to let her CIO. I've tried the attended CIO for a few hours and I just couldn't take it. She has a bedtime routine and a \"lovey.\" She goes down around the same time every night (7-7:30) and wakes herself up around the same time every morning (6-7, sometimes 7:30 if she's up for that 3-hour stretch). I put her down for naps as soon as she's tired. She had a problem taking longer than 30 minute naps, but I've been sitting in on  part of the naps and rocking her stroller through the transitions, so she's beginning to nap longer but with no improvement in the night wakings. I have read and read and read and have never found a description of a baby waking this frequently, which makes me feel even more alone and upset. \n\nWe tried having dad respond to her crying, but he didn't handle it well and he has to work early. We have NO ONE else to help; neither of us has family involved in our lives or friends in a position to help, and she cries when a stranger comes near her. \n\nShe is EBF and only just now is beginning to accept a bottle, but will only eat an ounce or so over a couple hours and then demands to be nursed. I'm beginning to really hate nursing and am considering switching to breastmilk in a bottle to see if that will help. I'm considering starting rice cereal before bed (as various people have been pushing for months but her doctor said not to do). \n\nShe has no symptoms of reflux. She doesn't seem to have a belly ache. I don't consume gluten or dairy. She is happy during the day (except for the tiredness, of course.) \n\nI feel like I'm going to go insane. I'm so tired. I miss my husband. I miss my bed. I want to enjoy my baby (and my other children). There seems to be no end in sight. I don't know what to do, but I can't keep doing this. I sometimes feel resentful and angry towards my beautiful baby (though I know it is obviously not her fault.) Between night sleeping and naps, my whole life is consumed by these sleep issues. \n\nHow do I get her to sleep outside the stroller? How do I get her to sleep longer? How can I get my life back without making her suffer?\n\n**TL;DR -- My 6-month-old wakes up 8-24 times a night including a long stretch, will only sleep in her travel system, and I am losing my mind (and straining my marriage). :(**\n\n*Edit: Bold TL;DR\n\n**Edit: Thank you sooo much for all the ideas and responses; you are all so thoughtful! I am overwhelmed by all the support. I think that I needed to hear that this isn't a \"normal\" consequence of breastfeeding and attentive parenting, and I really appreciate all the strategies you have given me to try.

I have a now 17 month old that was the worst sleeper ever and awoke 10-20 times a night up until about 9 months of age.  It's agony and incredibly stressful.  \n\nMy advice would be to first try and figure out exactly why is she waking up so often.  You can often tell by the way she cries out.  Does it seem like pain/colic/reflux (hard to sometimes tell and may be good to get full checkup with this in mind), hunger, separation anxiety from you?  If it's a reflux or colic issue, this can be remedied but you may still have major problems due to the habit she has of waking so often.  This was my problem.  Our little guy started out with nasty colic for the 1st 3 months, but when that eased, he was still waking a thousand times due to habit and just wanting to hang out with mommy like before.\n\nIf it's a hunger cry, you may want to introduce some solids during the day.  Six months is usually fine to do this.  Just some simple purees and such.  Even a few bites a day may make a difference in how full she feels at night. \n\nIf the waking problem is like mine and you have a beautiful, precious, but stubborn little baby that doesn't sleep well, this may be a tough road.  I read every book, tried EVERY technique for weeks and weeks, was firmly against crying it out or anything like that, but it got to the point where my husband and I were losing our minds.  The sleep deprivation becomes mental and physical torture.  I wasn't functioning well and we both were becoming zombie parents.  Not good.  It was the hardest decision, but I did eventually do a modified cry it out at 9 months.  After a week of hell it worked.  \n\nI'm not saying this is the way for you or anyone else, it's just my experience with a difficult sleeper. Hang in there!!  I promise you will sleep again and soon.  This was all less than a year ago and it now feels like decades away!  They grow so fast that this will feel like a blink of the eye someday.

You are stressed and exhausted, and when that happens tears are inevitable and its really hard to think straight and come up with a plan. Take a deep breath, you will get this figured out! This is my two cents, but I'm not expert. These are just thoughts coming from me, both as a mom and as a medical student who has worked 36 hour shifts and knows what real sleep deprivation feels like.\n\n1-Take the babe to the doc, make sure there is nothing going on (like reflux etc.) This way, if she is crying and waking up, you know there is nothing SERIOUSLY wrong that is causing pain/suffering. You won't feel guilty when she cries, because you know there is nothing that needs to be \"fixed.\" You won't lie in bed worrying yourself to death, and instead you can tell yourself \"my baby is fine, she is just learning to fall asleep and that is hard.\"\n\n2-If there is nothing medically wrong with your baby, then crying is NOT suffering. If they are healthy, have eaten, and have a dry diaper, there is NOTHING WRONG with crying. This is their only method of communication. I struggled with this BIG TIME (most moms do) when we started sleep training w my son (we started when he was around 3-3.5 mo old). I was tired and exhausted, and when he would cry going to bed I would break down in tears every time because I felt like I was failing my poor baby. My husband was the strong one, and would help me through it. One night I just couldn't do it any more, so we turned the baby monitor off and turned the TV on. He cried for 40 minutes and then went to sleep. After 1-2 weeks of his bedtime routine, he stopped crying and now goes straight to sleep every night. (bath, lotion and change, nurse, short book, cuddle and listen to one song on pandora, bedtime) If he doesn't fall right to sleep, he talks to the toys hanging from his crib until he is ready to sleep. \n\nSomething that worked for me during those first few really hard nights was setting a timer for 20 minutes. He would start crying and I would start the timer. I would listen to music, watch TV, take a shower, do laundry, anything but listen to him crying, then if he was still crying after 20 minutes I would go pick him up and hold him, rock him, cuddle etc and calm him down----then put him back in bed and let him try to fall asleep on his own again. Some nights it took a few times, but eventually he would fall asleep. It wasn't perfect, but it helped me not to feel like I wasn't allowed to comfort my crying baby while still teaching him to self soothe and learn to fall asleep on his own.\n\n3- In terms of the night awakenings, I would think NOT sleeping in the same room with her will make a huge difference. My doctor actually suggested this to me when I was exhausted and stressed! I had trouble with this too but my husband finally drew the line and basically said to me- \"You need to sleep, I need you in my bed, and he is full and nothing is hurting him, he will figure it out\" This is true, you need sleep. Babies are super loud sleepers and often wake at night (even for a few minutes) but then go back to sleep. Chances are you are noticing her waking up a million times because you are sleeping right next to her. Second, she probably hasn't learned to self soothe, so when she wakes up she can't fall back asleep. She is 6 months, and should be able to go AT LEAST 5-6 hours until NEEDING to eat. After she goes down, go to bed with your husband, set an alarm and go to her after 3-4 hours. If she wakes up and cries, she will learn to self soothe and go back to sleep instead of expecting you to help her. IT IS NOT HURTING HER.  I would get up with my son 5-10 times when he was sleeping in our room, when we moved him, I only got up 2 times because I wouldn't respond until he was clearly awake and hungry (ie loud)...not just awake and wanting me to hold him.\n\nThese are just my thoughts, but of course this is your baby and you need to do what is right for you family and I'm not an expert. I thought CIO and sleeping in separate rooms was the worst idea ever until I go to the end of my rope, then I made the leap because I had nothing left to try. I'm so happy I did and I wish someone had told me to do it sooner. YOU CAN MAKE IT THROUGH THIS! You are just too tired right now to feel like you can.\n\nOnce you get some sleep, this won't feel as formidable. I also got the book baby 411, which was the best 10$ I ever spent.\n\nTLDR: If there is nothing medically wrong and she is tired, fed, and dry, you might just have to let her cry it out, but DO NOT listen to it for an hour because you will go crazy. Don't sleep in the same room, set and alarm and go to her after 4 hours when you know she should be hungry, otherwise you will wake up with every twitch she makes--regardless of whether she needs your or not.", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1358652289, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "c802qwv", "link_id": "t3_16w7zq", "parent_id": "t3_16w7zq", "retrieved_on": 1431018072, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"archived": true, "author": "Lovely1108", "author_flair_css_class": "green", "author_flair_text": "Feb 08 &amp; Nov 11", "body": "I agree here.

First, your husband *will* figure out how to handle the baby better if given the opportunity and if he puts some effort into it. Will it be the way you would do it? Likely not, and that's ok!!! Daddits generally do things a little differently from the mommits. Babies somehow survive. Second, what works for us is to take shifts. I am \"on\" until 2 am, and then Bean's dad takes over, only waking me if nursing is required. This allows me to get a few hours of solid sleep before I have to go to work, enabling me to function. Since your husband has to work early, maybe he could take the 7-1 shift, and you could take the 1-7 shift. \n\nLook, I get that you want to let your husband sleep as much as possible, and that's thoughtful of you. My husband needs more sleep than i do to function, and I want him to have it (notice who has the long shift at my house).

I feel for you mama\n\nMy son is now 8 months old and wakes anywhere from 5-12 times a night between 7p-7a. He too sometimes wakes up at 5a and is just awake. Our reason of why he wakes is he needs to eat. I KNOW he needs to eat because he refuses to eat much during the day. For example: today he woke up at 7a and didn't until 3pm. Then again at 5p and again at 7 when I put him down. We've been up 6 times so far tonight so he could eat. \nHe's breastfed and always has been. When I introduced baby cereal it did nothing. I fed him at dinner time right before bed and it made no difference what so ever. The only thing that did happen was I had a lil boy who screamed bloody murder every time I tried to feed him pur\u00e9es. We started at 4 months and I gave up at around 5 months. Then reintroduced solids at 6 months but instead tried baby led weaning. This let him control the food and he no longer cries unless god forbid I make the mistake of trying to feed him something myself. When we started the baby led weaning and he actually ate food, it cut the night time waking a from about 12 down to 8 (although we still occasionally have a bad night). However, the solid food doesn't make up for the fact that he doesn't nurse much during the day and seeing as how he needs to eat... \nThe only thing that helps is co sleeping. He usually only naps for 30-40 mins if I'm lucky.  My son is also just a terrible night sleeper and occasionally has night terrors which started around 4 months (really young for them but I had them as a kid too). Because of this it's just so much easier to co sleep a nurse laying down. I stopped fighting trying to get him into a crib. I gave up trying to let him CIO, he cries so hard he stops breathing for seconds at a time and sweats profusely. Cosleeping and nursing at night is the only way we get the most amount of sleep. Maybe get a bed in the nursery you can both share instead of the cot and crib. I found the more fuss that had to be made (picking up from crib, going to sit to nurse) just made problems worse. \nI would say your best bet would be to check out a sleep clinic or someone who specializes in infant/children's sleep problems.

We started breakfast at about 7.5 months. He usually WILL NOT nurse at all in the morning so he chows down at breakfast. I leave him in his pjs and then change him. Much easier that way. \nAbout two weeks ago I started to offer egg YOLKS. I know this can be a high allergen but no one in our family is allergic so I felt comfortable introducing it. No whites as they don't offer much nutrition wise and they are supposedly what most people are actually allergic too. Anyways, I have seen a recent improvement with his morning nap. He's gone from 30 mins to an hr and the past three days he has taken a THREE HOUR NAP! I was stunned. But it's only been three days so I don't know if its from the egg or a growth spurt. I hope it's a permanent change. Obviously you'd have to evaluate if its appropriate for your lil one to introduce it this early. \nWe've gotten remarks from some who are a little wigged out that we give him while pieces of food but he's never choked once. He's gagged less than he did with the pur\u00e9es. It's what has worked best for us. \nOh and we haven't touched any grains since the baby cereal. Just fruits and eggs for breakfast then veggies and beans for dinner.\n\nI hope you find a sleep solution soon. It's so hard. Definitely the hardest part of having a baby IMO.

Even on the nights where he would cry, he would wake up smiling at me when I came in to get him in the morning. Think of how awful you feel being sleep deprived, and your baby is up all those hours too and is probably pretty exhausted as well. I promise that when they cry it feels way worse for you than it does for them. I thought the same thing you did and my husband made two good points to me, the first being: he is in his own bed in his own house with a nightlight, music, and his toys, and he knows that, he is not lonely or scared---he is bored and tired and needs to settle himself. Every kid in the history of the world tries to stay up past their bedtime. Second, you have no memories from being a 6 month old. Does anyone remember being born? Your baby will still love and trust you, especially since you respond to her every need ALL DAY LONG, she has no reason to think any differently.\n\nI still had trouble when he would go into the hysterical crying, because it just sounded so awful and I felt like he would never settle himself down once he got to that point and I didn't want him to think I abandoned him. Thats why I still let myself go pick him up and calm him down, then put him back to bed and give him another shot at it. In my head it felt like I was reassuring him that I had not abandoned him and would still respond, but he finally learned to settle himself after a week or so. \n\n ", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1358727591, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "c80jacl", "link_id": "t3_16w7zq", "parent_id": "t1_c80bspq", "retrieved_on": 1431026050, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"archived": true, "author": "Sburd", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "Hi again!\nMy son hasn't been gaining as much weight and my doctor actually suggested we start solid foods (and he is only 5 months). She told me there is actually some evidence out there that introducing some wheat around 5-6 months decreases the risk of gluten intolerance (celiac disease). I don't have an article to back this up though. There is no right way to start first foods. You should avoid peanuts/peanut butter (and nuts/nut butters) because of the risk of an allergic reaction. Don't give her honey because of the risk of botulism. After that, just try some pureed/mashed stuff and stick with less than 3 new foods per week (and not all on the same day!) so if she has a reaction (rash or diarrhea or something) you know which food it was from. Grab a box of the gerber wheat baby cereal from the store and mix it with breast milk. (My doc suggested wheat instead of rice so that he doesn't get constipated) I also grabbed bananas (sweet) and avocados (high in good fat and calories that will keep a baby full). You can also try full fat yogurt but my son didn't like it. You can always get jarred baby food too! I just tried these other things so that if there were leftovers I could eat them and they wouldn't go to waste.
