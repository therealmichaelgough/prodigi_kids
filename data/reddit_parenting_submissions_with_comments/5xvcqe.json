But just like every child all of the them develop different from each other.  Because you already got an evaluation and the SLP told you to wait a few months I think you should.  For now the only thing I can recommend to you while you wait is to do some Parallel and Self Talk.  We do this exercise when children are not talking yet.  For example: Your child is playing with a train.  You will sit with him and play with him.  You will describe to him what he is doing with the train. \" You grabbed the train.\" wait 5-10 sec to describe another action. \" The train color is red.\"  Keep each of the sentences very short and simple. You can also describe what you are doing.  \"Uh-oh. the car crashed against the train.\"  Another thing you could do is to put the things he wants out of reach so he is motivated to ask for them.  Repeat the name of the item and describe to him what he wants.  You could exercise 1-2 syllable words.  Work on words that he is able to see. \"M, P, B\".  He can see when you make the M, P, B sounds because they are bilabial (use both lips).  Look for a list of words with those sounds.

This is very likely to resolve with maturation.  I'm not sure why the SLP advised you to wait until he is independently mimicking--this can and is an important linguistic milestone that can be scaffolded in therapy.  He's in a critical developmental period, and early intervention is most effective and produces better outcomes in speech and language development.  The lack of pointing and regressions are really big red flags for evaluation and intervention.  \n\nI saw in a comment that you mentioned you were waiting on an appointment for a hearing eval, which is great, and definitely something to explore.  How is your son's receptive language?  Expressive vocabulary, or the words/signs he makes get use to communicate something to you, are one dimension of language development, but how many words does your son seem to recognize and understand?  Does he respond to his name?  Can he follow one-step directions, like \"throw the ball\" or \"clap your hands\"?  Can he identify simple body parts when promoted to find your feet, \"where's my nose,\" etc.?  Does he seem to enjoy music?  Does he make eye contact?  Does he look in your direction when you speak?\n\nScaffolded play to model language and pragmatic skills is great in the meantime.  Also, reading books is so good!  Big picture books that are attractive to him--make reading together exciting and fun.  Talk about what's on the page.  Describe what you see.  Ask questions (where's the dog hiding?) and pause before you answer them yourself the way you would in conversation, or guide him hand-over-hand to touch the dog or lift the flap, for example.  Simple and functional signs are good, even if he cannot or does not imitate them for a while.\n\nI'm in my second term of clinic practicum for speech &amp; language therapy currently, and also nanny for two kiddos with significant language delays/impairments.  I'm sure this is frustrating and confusing for you as a parent, and even though I want to emphasize how important early intervention is, you can absolutely try to work on some of those skills at home with your child if you can't yet get services.  I can send you links to some more at-home resources, if you'd be interested.  I hope I'm not overstepping--I see kids who fit your child's description in the clinic at least once a month, though, and I'm concerned and just wanted to give some of my thoughts.

He usually just mutters his own little gibberish quietly under his breath.  He can mimic actions but it's been a very recent thing.  He only started waving and clapping at 18 months and is copying our actions constantly now.  But we're having a hard time with specific communicative actions like pointing or shaking/nodding his head in answer.  I hope it's just because he was slow to pick up this skill and will learn soon.  Just yesterday he came on his own to \"help\" me clean the kitchen by copying my actions.\n\nMy son's receptive language is excellent.  He was a little slow to understand things but now is completely on track.  He follows directions very well.  I don't know how many words he understands but for example if he has his huge pile of stuffed animals and I say \"go get the whale\" he understands which animal is which.  He understands \"throw the ball\" and \"clap your hands\".  The only body parts he knows are his head and belly button.  He makes excellent eye contact and will often look at us for approval, if he sees something interesting etc.\n\nLuckily he's crazy about books recently, especially flap books.  His favourite is \"Dear Zoo\" and he laughs at all the animal sounds I make while lifting all the flaps on his own.  That's why his speech delay and people saying there are red flags is confusing to me.  He's very engaged and social despite being non-verbal.  He will even come up to you unprompted and cover his face to play peekaboo.  He is however a bit introverted and can play by himself for a long time (\"driving\" his cars is his favourite activity).\n\nThis is extremely frustrating and upsetting as a parent.  My extended family and husband think his delay is no big deal and that I'm worrying over nothing.  So I'm battling against everyone to get help which is making it even harder.
