Last night he asked his friend about his honest opinion about what he thinks. He said he had to pry it out of him but basically that his wife (my close friend) said that she was surprised that when she watched my son that he would flop around when he was mad and that she thought I could be doing more to discipline him and that she was surprised he acts like that. \nI was honestly a bit hurt by that comment mainly because I wish she could have spoken to me about it. \nAlso I feel when our kids are playing together  my son is respectful with sharing toys and how he acts. It seems like the children play well together. Of course there are normal behaviors like my son will be upset if he sees food and can\u2019t have it or her daughter will be possessive over her toys - but he is normally a very docile child (heard this from multiple people).  When he\u2019s stressed out when I leave him somewhere he does start to freak out a bit. I don\u2019t really know what I can even do about this and feel frustrated about the whole thing. I don\u2019t want to be one of those parents who don\u2019t accept any advice but at the same time I feel like I need to make sure that the advice I take is coming from the right place? I do plan on making sure I follow through every time he tries to hit and let him know it\u2019s not acceptable. I guess I just needed to vent.

We want our kids to live up to our expectations, not other peoples\u2019.

Our friends parent their kids in their way and it works for them, I guess. We parent in our way and it works for us. \n\nMy in laws think my 4 year old son should be quieter and less physical and less stubborn. They think we should scold him more (and probably spank him, though they haven\u2019t said it). They are wrong for a few reasons:\n\n1) My son\u2019s personality is very different from my husband\u2019s, their only child. What worked for them will not work for us. Scolding and beating both just make my son\u2019s behavior worse. \n\n2) Most of the time, we don\u2019t have a problem with the way my son behaves. THEY do. I won\u2019t change my expectations of him just because they\u2019re around. \n\nI refuse to parent the way they want me to - I will parent the way my son needs me to and the way I am comfortable with! \n\nIt sounds like your friend is being judgey because you aren\u2019t disciplining the way she is and/or your kid isn\u2019t acting the way hers is. Neither of those are your problem - they are both her problems! Even if you were disciplining him more, there\u2019s no guarantee his behavior would be any different. And her kids might not be little angels because of something she\u2019s doing - it may just be that they were born that way. \n\nYou are right to feel hurt by her judgement, but don\u2019t for one second question your parenting!

What you replied with is exactly what I don\u2019t want to be which is a parent who is blinded by love goggles and don\u2019t do anything about behaviors because they think their kid is so cute and can do no wrong. \nMy husband was raised in a strict family (his Dad had Mormon roots and they are big on discipline) and our friends happen to be a strict family as well (wonderfully behaved kids for the most part so it\u2019s is working for them). So I think their standards are a bit different from my standards. I want to have a balance and a sweet spot where I address behaviors but not go overboard.
