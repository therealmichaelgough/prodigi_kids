Especially at 2-2.5 when they still can't quite communicate effectively. My go to techniques are 1.) Pick your battles 2.) Distraction and 3.) Stay laughing. \nFor example; Does it really matter if shoes are on in the car? Maybe this is a battle that doesn't need to be fought. Tell your child they can leave shoes off till you are at the destination, but they must have them on when out of the car. Save your combat energy for important things like not touching the hot stove or not kicking you in the face.\nSecond, distraction. My son loves toy cars, so every single time we change a diaper I hand him a car to hold and play with till we're done. Usually, this distracts him long enough for me to ninja him out of and into a diaper. Also by distraction I mean activities. A busy toddler is a happy toddler which is in turn a happy parent. This can be anything along the lines of playgroups, play dates, park or outdoor time, painting, exploring, playing with toys, watching a fun show, etc. Toddlers are easy to distract and the more busy they are the less likely they are to drive you insane.  \nAnd lastly, have fun! If my son is driving me up the wall, the very best thing for it is to go into the bedroom and let him jump on our bed. I sit with him while he jumps and we have tickle fights and blow on his belly and get kisses and hugs and it ends in fits of giggles. What's easier to make you both feel better than laughing together? \n\n", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1403113485, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "ciavjuj", "link_id": "t3_28gyrk", "parent_id": "t3_28gyrk", "removal_reason": null, "retrieved_on": 1434296366, "score": 53, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"archived": true, "author": "sarahoflayton", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "Haha, more wine.

My son just turned 3, and I'm expecting my second any day now. I am a\nSAHM and have had quite a few days lately where things are harder and harder.\n\nTo answer your question about getting through all the tiny little problems through the day: I TRY to remain calm and think of ways that are compassionate, yet still assert the boundaries I want to set as a mom. For example, I give lots of 2 option choices (even though both options are ones I can live with). \"You have a choice - you can get in the car or I can put you in the car\"...and then follow through. With regard to the kicks at diaper changing (I can definitely empathize). My favorite is if it's before nap or bed time: \"Your behavior is showing me you are too tired for a story, so you can either calm your body and stop kicking or we are going straight to bed without a book\"...and then follow through. \n\nUsing the choices and the \"your behavior is telling me...\" line helps him, but being consistent is key. When all else fails, I put him in a safe place and walk away after explaining that we both need a break. \n\nAlso, getting out everyday to get out energy is essential - park, walk/run around block, etc definitley helps us. \n\nAnd, lastly, make sure you get some time for yourself. I don't know how hands on your partner is, but it's amazing what a trip to Target or Starbucks alone at the end of the day can do. I find alone time essential to my well-being. \nDon't beat yourself up. Toddlers are nuts sometimes. I'm sure you're doing your best, but it's always nice to reach out for support like this - I know I do the same thing when I've had it. Good luck!

I'll give you an example that literally just happened. 5 minutes ago, he told me wanted to watch a certain movie. I said no, and he got upset. I responded by saying, \"I know you're mad because you want to watch it now, but it's almost nap time so we'll watch it later.\" He's now fine. \n\nObviously, at 3 (he just turned 3 this week), he can understand more complex language like this.

I can honestly say that this type of acknowledgement helps a lot at the tender age of 2. Is it perfect? No. Does it prevent every temper tantrum? No. But it makes things a lot better and makes him feel like I actually care about his feelings - which, I obviously do.  \n\nEverything takes a good few days to a week I feel, but consistency is key and eventually they figure it out.

Controlling the options limits the possibilities but gives them the sense that they are in control. The great thing here is that you know your kid and what they'll want but you know what you want them to choose, so on issues where you really want them to do this thing your way, you give them an option you know they won't like as much as the option you want them to take.

When my boy acts out in less-than-calm ways, I still acknowledge his feelings (\"You must be so angry to be ______, but that's not ok\". Let's take a break and calm down\".) Then, I separate us from one another. I certainly don't want to be a pushover and let it happen, but I still want him to know it's absolutely unacceptable while still letting him know I get why he did it. This type of intervention usually works. Toddlers are so fun sometimes. I am sure I'll be ready to pull my hair out in a couple weeks, once the sleep deprivation is paired with caring for a newborn and a jealous kid. \n\nSomeone else gave me some advice that I found useful. Of course, we want to promote a positive relationship between siblings, but it's okay to acknowledge that it kinda sucks from the perspective of the older child at times. For example, if I notice that my 3 year old is getting upset while I feed the baby, I might say, \"I know it's hard when mommy has to feed sister so much instead of playing. How about when Daddy gets home, you and me have some special time together?\" And then do something one on one with the older child (a walk, trip to the park, an ice cream date, etc.). From others' experiences, this seems to help with the jealousy.\n\nOh, dear. I'm freaking out now. Good luck to us all! ;)\n\n\n", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1403150783, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "cibcpf8", "link_id": "t3_28gyrk", "parent_id": "t1_cib01m3", "removal_reason": null, "retrieved_on": 1434304584, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"archived": true, "author": "vidiuk", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "Thanks!

When she is calm enough to talk, I will ask her or tell her about whatever just happened (I.e., \"Mama had to pick you up because you said no to walking up the stairs\" or \"Did you feel angry because it was time to leave the playground?\") Then I try to explain why, and offer some resolution (\"I know it's sad sometimes to leave the playground, but right now it's dinner time.

No. But it's way more effective than when I lose my temper, and I think it truly is helping her understand consequences of her actions and being able to talk about her feelings.\n\nSorry for the wall of text!", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1403166330, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "cibgwf9", "link_id": "t3_28gyrk", "parent_id": "t1_ciawpe5", "removal_reason": null, "retrieved_on": 1434306626, "score": 5, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"archived": true, "author": "Rose1982", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "Exactly.
