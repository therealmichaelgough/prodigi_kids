High energy, high emotion. \n\nSo, here are my suggestions as a parent of six (nearly seven): \n\nFind a fun / sweet way to wake your daughter up each day. Or implement something if she wakes you up... getting a kid in a good mood for the day really helps. Make a big deal about saying good morning and give her plenty of cuddles. You can play a song or video that she likes and have her dancing whilst she waits for breakfast. \n\nFor mealtimes, there are plenty of kid dishes with a suction thing underneath that sticks to the high chair / table/ counter so that babies and toddlers can\u2019t throw them. Use them! Keep drinks at all times in non spill sippys until kids become a little more civilised. \n\nStop going to your group, at least for now. Maybe you enjoy it but probably the amount of stress brought about by going isn\u2019t worth it. \n\nHead outside- your garden, parks, playgrounds, soft play, hikes. Children are a lot like dogs. They need exercise! Especially high energy kids. Try to get the main portion of exercise after any afternoon nap, you\u2019ll see the benefit from that at bedtime. \n\nKeep a good routine. It doesn\u2019t need to be scheduled, because life, but the routine should pretty much stay consistent regardless of other plans that come along. Same bedtime, same wake up / breakfast, lunch, nap, a dedicated play time (maybe specifically for you and your daughter one-on-one), same supper time, same quiet wind down time before bed etc., \n\nWind down time for high energy kids is really important. No tv or electronics 1 hour before bed. Keep the household energy calm. Have a bath time, read a story, plenty of cuddles. \n\nWhen kids have a good and consistent play of the day to expect, that gives them reassurance, confidence and less curveballs that can produce tantrums. \n\nGive your child acceptable choices so she feels like she has some control. If there are options for lunch or what you\u2019re going to play, give her the choice. \n\nToddlerhood is not too early for discipline. This is the time they start pushing boundaries because they\u2019ve figured out that they\u2019re their own person and they can (at least try to) say no. Things like a naughty step or corner if something unacceptable happens is useful. Even if the child won\u2019t stay put- the message gets sent. \n\nNever give in to whining and don\u2019t go back on your word. That applies to every stage of parenthood. \n\nSpecifically when your child hits you (I know that sucks but, that\u2019s toddlerhood) tell your child that you\u2019re really sad that she hit you and that you love her and like her but you don\u2019t like what she did. Tell her you\u2019d like her to say sorry and not do it again. Nothing else until she\u2019s apologised/ given a hug etc., \n\nTell your husband things have been difficult. The above tips will really help, but implementation of things until they stick can take time- you have to gun for it, but you\u2019re already drained. Make sure your husband gives you a little time for yourself to do something for you on a regular enough basis. Go shopping, go on a hike, go to the salon, something relaxing and rejuvenating. Don\u2019t waste your \u2018me time\u2019 on something like catching up with family or friends- if they have their own stuff going on you could go home more mentally drained than when you left. Unless that\u2019s your jam, you do you. Just do something restorative. \n\nMake sure your husband is totally on board with the routine when he\u2019s at home, unity is imperative. \n\nDon\u2019t be hard on yourself. Parenthood is hard, toddlerhood is very hard. This phase won\u2019t last, I promise.", "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "created_utc": 1563038089, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "gildings": {}, "id": "etouplf", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_ccqcsb", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_ccqcsb", "permalink": "/r/Mommit/comments/ccqcsb/my_daughter_is_driving_me_nuts/etouplf/", "retrieved_on": 1563038090, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3", "total_awards_received": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "approved_at_utc": null, "author": "kmtandthetwins", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1ieldxjo", "author_patreon_flair": false, "banned_at_utc": null, "body": "Like I said, I'm not trying to diagnose anything.
