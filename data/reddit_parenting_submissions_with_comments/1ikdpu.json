I was shopping and my 9 month old dropped his toy on the ground and I picked it up and gave it back to him. The lady in line behind me was like that is gross, I started laughing because her son was chewing on her purse strap. I told her to MYOB and checked out and walked off.\n\nA family member of mine was horrified that I left my son watch educational cartoons like disney junior. Her son is almost 7 and has never slept on his own which is fine if your co sleeping but she admits to hating it and not being able to control him. She has to buy him a toy every time they go out just to get him through a shopping trip. I don't care how she raises her son but he did poke my son in the eyeball when he was trying to sleep and then lied about it.  \n\nI just am tired of moms being judgmental we all are different all parent different unless your doing something harmful or they ask your advice why can't everyone just relax. \n\nEDIT I have no problem with cosleeping I did it when I was breastfeeding, I was pointing out she hates sleeping with him and admits to failing and she uses her age as an excuse for her bad parenting which I find annoying. I know I sound judgy and I am more just trying to get it out sorry if I ruffled feathers. Everyone judges it is human to judge in your mind but I think it is strange to speak up about it to a stranger just trying to make yourself look better or cause a conflict.
