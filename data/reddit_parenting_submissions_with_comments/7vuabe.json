And because I dragged my feet he's delayed and will actually have to get several.  I know I'm being irrational but I am absolutely terrified.   \n\nIt has been hammered into me since birth that vaccines kill and maim.  My mother told me \"the light would go out of his eyes\".  She told me he might suddenly become delayed, get new allergies, become severely disabled.  Everything bad.  I'm trying to be brave and do the right thing but I keep crying.  By family has sent me every article about vaccine injury they can find.  But my husband is determined and I understand he needs them.  \n\nI rely heavily on my \"mom instinct\" but right now it's being drowned out by fear instilled by decades of brain-washing.  \n\nSo please, tell me happy stories about how your child is perfect and intelligent and vaccinated.

Only once has my boy gotten a mild fever afterwards but that's totally normal! Thank you for deciding to vaccinate your baby.

Vaccines are generally effective (and safe!) but, like anything, a certain percentage will not work for some people (that is, there will be no effect and the person might not be immune). That small fraction relies on **herd immunity** - meaning they don't get sick because enough people around them are immune so the disease can't spread. Herd immunity also protects babies who are too young to be vaccinated, and people who have compromised immune systems, such as those undergoing cancer treatment. \n\nYou probably know all this already, but I just wanted to remind you: not only are you doing something good for your immediate family, but also for your whole community. Thank you! Also, I would like to commend you for your open mind and critical thinking skills in the face of pressure not to vaccinate.
