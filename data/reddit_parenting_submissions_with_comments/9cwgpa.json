These are my opinions/feelings and I'm searching for answers from people who know the mom life best. \n\nSo for years and years, I've known I don't want children. I've avoided children for as long as I can remember. When family members were born, I always begged my mom to not make me go to the hospital or have to hold the baby. I've always been way more of an animal person than a baby person. I don't 'hate' children, it's just that being around them makes me a little uncomfortable.\n\nThat was all fine and dandy to me for a while until I met my SO who absolutely wants kids. He loves kids, grew up helping take care of his sibling/cousins and doesn't see his life without him. We've been together 5 years now and while he knows I'm not completely gung-ho, I'm not sure he understands the extent of my aversion. As we get older and I feel that we will likely get engaged soon, I can't help but constantly think about the expectation to have children in the next few years. The more I evaluate, I realize that I don't necessarily hate the idea of having older children. I think I'd like being a mom to school-aged children, especially when they get into their teens (I was a high school teacher for a little bit, so this makes sense), so maybe I just don't feel warmly to younger children.\n\nAlso, child birth absolutely scares me and I don't imagine myself feeling that immediate bond to a stranger who is now going to absolutely take over my life. I hate the idea of giving up my life as I know it and spending every penny I work for on my child. I don't see myself loving anything as much as I love my dogs. Everyone says these feelings will develop but what if they don't? What if, because I love my SO, I decide to have children and I regret it? I also think about the environment implications of having more children, and is it fair to force them to grow up in a world where the future is a little murky? \n\nDid anyone feel this way but now loves being a mom? Would anyone be willing to admit that they regret their decision (I think it's possible to love your children but regret that you had them at the same time)? I don't know what answers I'm looking for but typing this out was therapeutic nonetheless. I think I want to be a person who wants children and I'm hoping you guys can turn me....", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3", "subreddit_subscribers": 38759, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "To have or not to have?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/9cwgpa/to_have_or_not_to_have/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, "comments": [{"approved_at_utc": null, "author": "JustGingerIt", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1jogba7", "banned_at_utc": null, "body": "I didn\u2019t know if I wanted children.

(I\u2019m not rich or anything) it was just nice to go to bed late when I feel like it, wake up when I wanted or go to bed early, etc (I love sleep).

Having a child because your partner wants kids....just isn\u2019t fair to the child. If you resent the child, then that kid could potentially have major issues as they grow. Kids know when the love isn\u2019t genuine or given freely. OR you could have a kid and be absolutely blown away by how incredible it is. That being said, if a child is even an option, you need to be prepared to go all in. \n\nIf deep down you know you do not want kids and you know your partners life goal is to be a father, then you two are probably incompatible long term. You may have a kid and then hate your spouse because you feel like he forced you to do something that you didn\u2019t want in the first place.

It is very difficult to find placement in the foster care system for older children, so you could be making a huge difference in a child's life as well. \n\nI highly recommend sitting down and having this conversation with your SO before you get engaged.

You have to think about someone other than yourself, for the rest of your life, and be okay with that. \n\nAlso, I'm a firm believer that no one should have a child to make someone else happy. If the only reason you have a child is to make your partner happy, there is a high chance that you will regret having that child and resent your partner for it. And then everyone is miserable -  you, your partner, and the child. \n\nI think you need to really be honest with yourself about your feelings toward becoming a parent and maybe even talk with a professional about it. Examine why you feel like there is this big pressure and expectation on you to have kids (is he putting this on you?), how you feel about it, and how you want to react. And then tell your partner those thoughts and feelings and work together to see if you can both live with whatever conclusion you've come to. \n\nBest of luck to you.

I knew having a child for him was a bad idea, that I would need to want it myself, otherwise I'd regret it and resent him and life would be miserable eventually. So I embarked on a journey (not to sound too corny) to really dig into what I wanted in life, what my core values were, what my calling was. I saw a counsellor, I took on a variety of new volunteer opportunities, and I journaled a lot. I came round to adopting first, but SO was pretty against it, he wanted his own biological child. So I rolled my eyes and went back to the drawing board. I had some good conversations with women in my field who told me their children were the best thing, and there was one who told me to just get over it, they weren't going to ruin my life. That actually helped me get over the final hump. That and my sense of competition -- watching SO's friends have babies and figure out how to parent and decide on schools, etc, made me want to do it too so I could do it better, lol. \n\nSo here I am now, with a 2 month old, and no regrets. I also believe I would have zero regrets if I'd chosen a childless path. That said, from the moment I found out I was pregnant I found my career ambition levels had dropped. I'm not sure how that will play out in the long run. \n\nAlso, when a friend asked me at 8 months pregnant what part of parenthood I was looking forward to most, I said, When they're 18 and moving out of the house. I'm still looking forward to that, but I'm enjoying my infant so much more than I thought I would and finding myself looking forward to all of the next 18 years.

I wasn\u2019t interested in babies, I\u2019m pretty unemotional and definitely not maternal at all. But I\u2019ve been with my husband a long time and gradually, we both grew to decide we should have children. I knew that when I was middle aged, I wanted to have children and to have them, I had to have a baby around this age. I hope that makes some kind of sense - I\u2019m trying to say I didn\u2019t necessarily want a \u2018baby\u2019. Pregnant was a breeze but the birth was awful and I had some kind of hormonal/mental breakdown after birth or postnatal depression or whatever you want to call it. It was truly the hardest, most awful time of my life and I was convinced I had made a terrible decision and be one of those mothers you hear about who abandon their families. \n\nBut I was lucky and it lifted naturally at 4 months pp when I got my first period (I do not react well to hormones man). And now, the bond with my son is everything you are told having a child is. I love him an indescribable amount and would suffer through the bad parts ten times over to have him. Anyway I\u2019m massively rambling but the point is, just really sit down and think about what you want. Not just now but when you\u2019re older. It\u2019s an unfortunate fact of womanhood that we have such a short space of time to make huge decisions due to our biology. \n\nAlso a final note: if you search on other parenting subs, there are stories of true regret at having children but I\u2019d say they are fairly rare? It\u2019s very common to regret the decision in the first year or so because it is hard flipping work!

I knew he\u2019d be a good father and I felt it was the right next step. Last October we decided to let things happen. I figured it\u2019d take a while. Nope. Got pregnant right away. I was worried about our lives changing, but I was so excited!! We had our son 6 weeks ago. Life is hard and different, but I wouldn\u2019t change it.
