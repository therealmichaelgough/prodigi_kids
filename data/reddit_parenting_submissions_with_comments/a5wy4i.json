My daughter was hell to potty train. Very, very slowly the accidents just became less frequent. I found that almost completely ignoring the accidents other than to have her clean them up herself was the most effective way to handle them. She was almost accident free for a year (late 4- late 5). Now every time we have any sort of change in our lives, she starts having A LOT of accidents again. We moved over the summer and it got very bad. We ended up having to go to therapy and a urologist, where we found out that she'd been holding it for so long that her bladder was becoming distended and weak. \n\nWe started using a potty watch. I got a cheap fitness tracker on Amazon that had a bunch of programmable vibrating alerts. I set them based on what her daily schedule was (wake up, before the bus, 2 before lunch, 2 after lunch, 1 right after bus drop off, 1 around dinner time, 1 at bed time). It isn't water proof and sometime the alarms get turned off on accident, so for a younger child you may want a more durable actual potty watch. Anyway, having the watch let me get off her case about it, which made her feel more in control of the situation. The regular reminders to go helped her bladder heal and get stronger, and retrained her to be more aware of the urge. She's highly intelligent, creative, and imaginative and can have very intense focus and she just totally misses the urge to go sometimes. On top of that she's a but anxious and controlling which makes her want to have control of the urge to go. The potty watched helped a lot with all of that. \n\nShe still has occasional accidents, but she's doing much better.

One day, when she was four, she asked for a Minnie Mouse microwave if she pooped. I said yes, she pooped on the potty and never had an accident. \n\nShortly after that, she wanted to wear undies to bed. Again, no accidents. \n\nAll this time, we talked about how when she was big, she\u2019d wear undies all day and night. \n\nIt was kind of a compromise because I wanted her to dictate the pace of the potty training, but school forced us to start. \n\nAt the end, it took one full year to get her one hundred percent trained.
