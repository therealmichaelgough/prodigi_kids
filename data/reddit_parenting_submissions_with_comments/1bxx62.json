And if it does, is this pleasurable sensation long-lasting, or quite brief?\n\nWe're all human, we all feel outrage at times. Oftentimes, its intensity (or outright absence) is context-dependent; the experiences and people we hold dearest to ourselves can often provoke the most outrage.\n\nIndeed, I experienced a little bit of outrage when I read your post. Luckily, it's the internet, it was a decent day, and I hope I was able to construct a thought-provoking, yet gentle comment. However, that is for you and the rest of the internet to judge, not me.\n\nI might suggest that perhaps what you describe as **hate for the mother** is actually **love and concern for the child in the picture**. Even if this is mental sleight-of-hand, one might find that time spent entertaining this notion modifies the flavor of the sensation described as \"hate for the mother\". One might find themselves watching and waiting on the sensation itself, instead of entertaining this notion. And the sensation's intensity may be just as powerful, but with some waiting, its character might soften. \n\nAnd one upside of this is that what previously was an opportunity to practice hate, is now an opportunity to practice love. \n\nNeurologically speaking this shift in practice is quite important, because as far as we know from science--neurons that fire together, wire together.

It isn't law, just recommended, but since it is a matter of life or death, people follow the recommendations. They average less than 1 child fatality under age 4 due to vehicle collisions per year. (The statistics I was reading even went as far as to mention that the few deaths that did occur were not at all related to the type of restraint used, they were all completely unavoidable.)\n\nThe USA averages somewhere around 200 children under age 4 per year.\n\nForward facing early/earlier than necessary (following the law) and putting children who are not mature enough to ride in a booster or seatbelt without moving the belt out of position, or using a booster which provides a poor belt fit (lap belt up on the abdomen, shoulder belt off the shoulder or on the neck) do lead to deaths. Talk to any ER doctor in a children's hospital and ask them what they think of rear facing past the minimum requirement.\n\nThere are a great many vehicle deaths in Canada, the USA and Australia (likely other countries too, but those I know off hand) of children which are considered preventable. Laws take a long time to change and there are always people fighting to keep them the same. Example: people (pilots and parents whose children were injured or killed) have been lobbying to make flying with a child on your lap illegal since the late 70's. That hasn't changed because the FAA (who recommend against that very thing) is afraid of the back lash. That's just politics. Do you really believe all the politicians have your child's best interest in mind? I'm willing to bet most are more worried about their polls.\n\nThe law is the bare minimum.\n\nWhy, when vehicle collisions are still the leading cause of death for children, wouldn't you want to do more than the absolute bare minimum?", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1365771786, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": 1365787773, "gilded": 0, "id": "c9dpylq", "link_id": "t3_1bxx62", "parent_id": "t1_c9dif8i", "removal_reason": null, "retrieved_on": 1431583200, "score": 2, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"archived": true, "author": "Pixielo", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "I swear I'm not trying to poke holes in your statement; I too, think that Sweden is pretty awesome.
