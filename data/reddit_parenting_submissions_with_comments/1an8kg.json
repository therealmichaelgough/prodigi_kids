I've heard from many other friends that this happened for them after college too, so that may be one issue that is happening for you.  Then, after having my kid I found that it gradually became easier and easier again.  Conversations usually started with \"How old is yours?\" and then questions about whether they are crawling/walking/sleeping/talking, etc. I have found that making friends after college is much harder work.  It takes an intentional effort.  I found that going to the same activitiy - story time, park, gym class etc. regularly and then trying to set up a playdate with the moms who seemed interesting was helpful.  Most new moms are lonely too and it takes someone to initiate it.  It is a lot like dating.  Some playdates lead to second dates, some don't. It takes time to establish those relationships though.  My son is 3.5 now, and all of my closest friends are friends that I met since he was born who have kids his age.  It can happen for you.  I say try to be the initiator, invite someone over for a playdate, and very soon you'll be having deeper conversations.

To meet more friends you have to talk to more people. \n\nThe great thing about meeting mom friends is that just by having children you already have a lot in common with someone. People *LOVE* talking about their children so you have the perfect ice breaker standing in front of you - their kids! I usually start by asking how old the kid is or saying something about how cute the kid is. I've even walked up to kids with my son so that the kids could look at each other and interact...kind of what you might do with two dogs at a dog park. \n\nWhen I meet someone I connect with I say something like it's been great talking - lets stay in touch / get together sometime soon and ask for a number. I've found it easiest to send a text to the person's phone right there. I send a quick message saying something like great to meet you and include my full name, my son's name and his age. I just realized I never talk on the phone (!) unless it's my mom. With friends I text to stay in touch and schedule get togethers.  I usually follow up within a few days to setup a get together though with one of my best mama friends something like a month went by.\n\nMy son is still really young but my experience so far is that most social interactions I have these days can be construed as socially awkward because I have split attention. On the one hand I'm having a conversation but on the other I am trying to keep the baby from mayhem. So don't worry about awkwardness. \n\nThe more you practice and model social behavior, the more it will help your kids. It will be good for them to see how you navigate approaching others and the time you invest in friendship.\n\nOne side note - a lot of people complain about how moms spend all their time one-upping each other about their children's development, successes, etc. This has not been my experience at all.  We do talk about our children a lot but that is because our children are such a large part of our lives. Don't assume that other moms are judging you even if you are different. If you do meet some judgy pants you can move on. My friends and I all vary a lot in how we raise our kids, work or stay home, handle finances, feed our babies, co-sleep vs. sleep train, etc. I will say though that my friends treat their children (and other people) respectfully and with love.\n\nGood luck!

I had done some sewing between '08 and '10, and stopped for a year. I had to re-acquaint myself in '11 and started with that Butterick pattern. \n\nI got some really cool ideas from [Threadbanger](http://www.youtube.com/user/ThreadBanger) for things for myself. Back in '08 they had a gorgeous and simple cape pattern that I made for myself with a matching beret before I got pregnant. I can't find it, now, but if you're into capes, they're fairly easy once you get the hang of it. \n\n", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1363844452, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": 1363847950, "gilded": 0, "id": "c8zmnrx", "link_id": "t3_1an8kg", "parent_id": "t1_c8zl4zf", "removal_reason": null, "retrieved_on": 1431654667, "score": 3, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "Once you get out there again it gets easier.
