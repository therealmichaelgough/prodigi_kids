Will be having another baby shortly before his 2nd birthday. Sometimes I think I would like to be done after this baby, but other times I have the number 3 stuck in my head as the perfect number of kids. \nI realize I don't have to decide right away. I'm getting an iud after this pregnancy so we don't have any \"accidents\" while unsure. \nI'm enjoying my boy more and more the older he gets and I am glad him and his sibling will be close in age. He is getting easier to care for and (get a babysitter for) also is able to do more on outings &amp;amp;amp; I find myself longing for the baby stage of my unborn baby to be over with and for new baby to be at this age as well. \nSorry for the rambling but basically I don't like being pregnant and do not like the newborn stage. I basically want to \"get it over with\" to get to the older stages where they are more fun to play/do things with. (Ie, vacations, sports, activities, games) \nAlso, for financial reasons I think 2 would probably be better (able to keep car as second vehicle, travel, buying things for them in general, saving for college) \nAnyway, insight into how you decided would be great :) \n\nEdit: thank you guys so SO much for the input. You don't even know how much of a help this has been to me!! You've all given me such great points and things to think through. I feel confident now about deciding that I only want 2 &amp; will be looking at permanent birth control after this baby :) thanks again!!!!

We have a one year old currently. My husband wants a big family, I'm content with more than one, but not sure I could handle a herd. \n\nReasons why we have a range instead of a definite number:\n1) I worked with high needs kids with developmental delays for the last 5 years- there is a possibility that we could have a kid who needs a lot more help and attention to succeed. Having fewer kids would be a wise choice in this case. \n2) birth control isn't 100% I know other couples who've had surprise children, I want to be open to that possibility too, while taking precautions and planning as best we can.\n3) we're trying out me being a stay at home mom. We are fortunate to have the option financially to go either way. The more kids we have, the longer I'll stay home (or figure out expensive childcare, which increases with every child) I like it so far, but want to keep an open mind about when going back to work makes sense. \n4) spacing between kids/my age- I'm 27 now, hoping to space kids 2-3 years apart. I know older pregnancies can be harder/riskier. Open to shorter spacing too, but there are hardships that come with that choice too. Taking pacing one at a time right now.", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1423358364, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "coekk26", "link_id": "t3_2v32a2", "parent_id": "t3_2v32a2", "score": 2, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"archived": false, "author": "Tip-Toe-Tulip", "author_flair_css_class": "purple", "author_flair_text": "4 yo boy, 2 yo boy &amp; 2 mo girl", "body": "We had planned on 2.  Our first 2 (boys) are 22 months apart.  After Ds2 was born, my husband admitted that maybe he wanted another (personally I blame watching too many episodes of Parenthood).  We both thouht about it some more.   I had wanted to be done having kids by 30, which I had managed with the two, but a third woukd be in my early 30's.  I also didn't want large age gap and as crazy as this sounds, I worried that a 4 or 5 year age gap between the oldest and youngest might be too much.\n\nWe decided to go for it.  It just felt right.  Our house is probably too small for it, our finances not huge, but I sort of feel like I was afforded too many luxuries growing up.  We weren't rich, but I never felt like I was restricted growing up.  I had my own room, a pool in the backyard.  We didn't travel, but that wasn't really as big a need back then.  Life was so good that I didn't move out until my early 20's.  And then the shock of going from a life of Mom and Dad taking  care of me, to paying the bills and cleaning was a big one.\n\nBecause of that I think it may actually be a good thing, we have enough money for the kids we have, but nothing exessive.  \n\nLong story short, we gave birth to a beautiful baby GIRL two months ago.  I can't believe anyone could be as lucky as me (amazing husband, two remarkable boys and a sweet baby girl).  Three births in 4 years has been difficult,  but it feels so right.\n\nBest of luck in your journey.", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1423361848, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "coem6ry", "link_id": "t3_2v32a2", "parent_id": "t3_2v32a2", "score": 2, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"archived": false, "author": "Tip-Toe-Tulip", "author_flair_css_class": "purple", "author_flair_text": "4 yo boy, 2 yo boy &amp; 2 mo girl", "body": "I had prenatal depression with my third.
