I wanted nothing more and we felt ready. We stopped using protection. \n\nOn Valentine's Day of this year I found out I was pregnant. We were so excited. Husband was thrilled. \n\nThe closer my due date approached and the bigger I got I started regretting it. The pregnancy wasn't even hard. I had morning sickness but overall my symptoms were non existent. I had an easy pregnancy. \n\nBut the thought of a baby now seemed like a bad idea. After the baby shower when I had all her stuff in her room I wasn't even happy. It just kept feeling more and more real and I was dreading the delivery day. (I was terrified of delivering)\n\nFinally on Sunday she came. When I held her for the first time I was just happy that labor was over. I cried when I saw her. And I felt like maybe now having met her my fears and feelings would disappear. \n\nI was wrong. 3 days later and I'm not attached to her at all. She feels like a burden and I feel like the worst person in the world for bringing her into this life. I see her and I just apologize and cry to her. I thought I wanted her more than anything but I wish I could go back in time and tell my husband I don't want kids. \n\nLuckily my husband has been amazing with her. He doesn't know about my feelings. \n\nI feel horrible and I don't know what to do. Any words of encouragement?
