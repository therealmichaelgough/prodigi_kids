Strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, rhubarb. \n\n**Dairy:** Is okay if there is no sugar in it!  Keto is almost based on cheese, it feels like, sometimes.  However, read the label on your milk.  Notice how many grams of sugar is in it.  I never realized, myself, it's nuts!  I eat all dairy, but switched to Vanilla, Unsweetened Almond milk.\n\n**Carbs:** It is most common for people to limit their carbs to under 20g/day.  So, you can have some.  To get more technical, you only need to watch your \"net carbs'=g of carbs - g of fiber.  \n\n**What can we eat?**: Everything as long as it does not have sugar, and stay under 20g carbs.
