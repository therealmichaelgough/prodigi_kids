Simpson. I know, call me crazy. Also- MIL says \"Well if you name him Darwin (another name we were liking) you can easily change it.\" The fuck I can! And what if I don't name him that? What if his first name is Nigel? How do you change that O to an N? (No, his name isn't really going to be Nigel, but you get my point).\n\nI love her sisters blankets and stuff, and now I'm all pissed off because it's got the wrong initials on it. A hand-made blanket and it doesn't have the right initials all because my MIL is a stupid bitch who decided to tell everyone his name is fucking Oliver.\n\nIt's like SHE wants the baby named Oliver, so she is telling everyone that his name is such. Her doing this shit is driving me crazy. I have stopped telling her names, because she keeps telling everyone and everyone is making it concrete! What the SHIT.
