The two most common I hear seem to be that either I'm single-handedly overpopulating the earth or that I need to have another one so my son (only boy) can have a brother. Both are equally annoying. We're open to having more, but I don't get a say if we have a boy or a girl lol. I think people think that 4 and 5 were us \"trying for a boy,\" but they weren't.
