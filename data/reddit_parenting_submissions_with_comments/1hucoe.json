I realize very few people are lucky enough to have an \"easy\" birth but a girl can have hope, right?\n\nWhat I think disqualifies your birth story as an \"easy\" one:\n\n1.)  Agonizing contractions in early labor (active labor is another story, obviously)\n\n2.)  Anything more than superficial/ first degree tears\n\n3.)  Drugs of any type not working the way they were intended.\n\n4.)  Nearly dying.  Either of you.  That should be a given.\n\n\nIt would be amazing if your story also included:\n\n5.)  No drugs\n\n6.)  First time pregnancy\n\n7.)  Labor being relatively short\n\n\nDo you know what totally unrealistic thing I'd love to hear?  \"I was having very mild cramps but I didn't think anything about it because labor is supposed to be horrible, right?  Well, all of a sudden I felt the need to push and fifteen minutes later my precious little [insert name here] practically fell right out.\"  \n\nIf you are one of the lucky few, please also share your words of wisdom.  Did you do the mommy workouts and squat your way to an \"easy\" birth?  Do you swear by willow bark tea?  Bradley Method?  Buddhist prayers while laboring?  Counter pressure by husband with chilled hands?  Perineal massage with coconut oil?

I didn't do any workouts or yoga or anything, although I am a musician, so controlling my breathing and mind is something I have a LOT of practice in. I also did perineal massage with vitamin E oil and my midwife did a \"pelvic tour\" with me to give me a preview of the kinds of sensations to expect. Highly recommend both of these! Altogether my labor was about 11 hours, but it was only bothersome for maybe 5.\n\nI was a week overdue, very little in the way of BH contractions, no loss of mucus plug, so when at about 8:30 in the morning I felt very mild period cramps, I dismissed them and went back to sleep. By 9:30, I couldn't sleep through them anymore, so I got up and went about my day, still fully expecting them to go away. My Mom was staying with us (first grandchild for her!), so she persuaded me to time them at about 10:30, by which point they were already a minute long and only 2 or 3 apart. I still didn't want to get my hopes up, so I held off on calling my husband home and calling the midwives until noon. I could keep my voice entirely steady through contractions, so they just said to keep in touch. Once my husband got home, I just ate light foods and played video games with him until the contractions got distracting enough, about 4:00. However, at 4:30, I was still able to answer questions on Jeopardy! during them, so I didn't think I was in active labor. My mother thought I should call the midwives back, though, so I humored her. They listened to me (by this point I didn't *want* to talk through contractions but I *could*) and said I could come in if I wanted. We decided to go in and, because it was rush hour, the 15 minute drive took 45. This was the worst part of the entire labor (being stuck in one position in a car SUCKS), however I felt clear-headed and was commenting on the drive and felt no need for medication, though I did feel the need to hum through contractions.\n\nGot to the birth center and they realized that they could actually see her head a bit and that I was 8cm! That whole car ride was not just active labor, but transition--and it was nowhere near as awful as I'd expected. They tried to do monitoring but it didn't work well with her head so low so they gave up and had me get in the tub. Oh, the blessed tub. That took me right back to around 4:00 in terms of intensity, though it was now 6:30-7. My husband did counter pressure, which was also lovely. However again, my mind was totally clear and we were joking around in between contractions--absolutely no desire for meds.\n\n After about half an hour in the tub, they told me I could push, which surprised me as I did not feel any urge to. Consequently, it took a few contractions for me to get the hang of it. She came out after about 3 good pushes (the one before, I could see her hair!!) and I had two tiny tears that needed no stitches, just glue on one. I think I could have avoided even that if I hadn't been slightly impatient and pushed through the end of the last contraction rather than waiting for the next one. I could feel the tear, but it felt only like a paper cut under the intensity of everything else. I had no idea how bad it was until they took a look later.\n\nShe came out so easily that she was born in the caul, which broke as my husband lifted her out of the water and she was so calm about the whole thing that she barely cried and they had to pinch her to do her APGARs. I delivered the placenta easily about 10 minutes later. My husband got to cut the cord and they let us all snuggle together in bed for a couple hours. She latched on immediately and easily. Also, all pain vanishes instantly. I felt quite squidgy around the middle and shaky, but that's it. After doing all the post-birth necessities, they sent us home just after midnight and by 1am, all three of us were tucked into our bed at home.\n\nI feel so blessed--I really couldn't have asked for anything more!

It was nearly one o'clock in the morning and I was having trouble drifting off because I felt pressure down there and thought I had to use the bathroom. Somehow I managed to finally drift off, only to be awoken around 3:30am with the urge to use the bathroom. As I groggily meandered to the toilet, I really didn't think anything was starting. After sitting there for a half hour, it suddenly dawned on me that these were regular contractions. So I drew a nice warm bath, got in, and relaxed for nearly an hour. I finally called out to my husband, who was still sleeping, that perhaps we ought to time my contractions. He bolted out of bed and rapidly obliged. They were less than 5 minutes apart and getting closer. We called the midwife to let her know that this was the day. Around 6AM, we met the midwife at the birth center. They were closed that day, so it was just the three (soon to be four!) of us. I sat and labored on my birthing ball, gently rocking back and forth, while the massive birthing tub was filled with warm water. The lights were on the lowest dimmer setting and we lit my lavender candles and placed them around the tub. I got in to the welcoming warm water and eased my seemingly massive weight into the tub. It was instant relief. I was weightless and could move around, flipping from my back to my stomach and rolling around in the warm water. My iPad was hooked into the birth center's sound system and I played the playlist I had prepared (mainly Peter Murphy and Dead Can Dance's new album). THe contractions didn't exactly hurt, but I knew they were happening. It was mainly pressure that came in surges. At 11AM, I finally asked the midwife to check my progress. I was at 9cm. It wasn't long after that I felt the urge to push. It was an overwhelming urge. My son was born at 12:17PM still in his gestational sac. I was on all fours and pulled him to my chest through my legs and just held him, crying the best tears of my life. He looked up at me, right in the eyes, as I held him. He let out a quick cry, then I laid back with him on my chest. He latched on and promptly fell asleep on me. We laid in the tub for nearly an hour before cutting the cord. After my husband cut the cord, they took my son away to weight him while I washed myself off and shampooed my hair. It felt great to clean up. The tub was drained and I was helped out and onto the queen size bed. They brought my son to me. When I was checked, I barely had a graze. In fact they really weren't sure if it even was a graze.

I managed to finish out the workday with no problems whatsoever - those few hours were easier than shark week.  Husband and I got takeout dinner, checked that the bags were ready, and chilled.

Husband and I had sexy time at 9pm - I noticed a slight pink discharge when I cleaned up, but didn't think too much about it (in retrospect I *think* this is when my water broke). Went to sleep. 1 am, I wake up feeling like I am having cramps - lay there for a while and notice that they are only a couple minutes apart. Time them for a while and call the midwife. At this point, they are clearly contractions but not as painful as I expected them to be. I tell the midwife frequency and duration - they were only about 30 seconds each and she says to call her back when they are more like a minute long. So husband and I continue to time them. I wouldn't say they were painless, but I remember menstrual cramps as a teenager that hurt that much. Finally at 5 am they are frequent and longer. Call the midwife again. She can tell I'm feeling it now, and says come in. We arrive at the Midwife Center and she checks my cervix. I'm 9 cm! I'm not ready to push yet, so I go sit in the jacuzzi tub and husband pours water over my belly (the best thing ever!). Finally feel the urge to push.  The most comfortable initial position for me is on the toilet, so midwife hangs out with me there during initial pushing. Then we move me to the bed for the grand finale. Again, this whole time it DOES hurt, but it's manageable. I was surprised to find that between contractions I was able to have a normal conversation with my husband and the midwives. The hardest part was when the baby was actually in my vagina and almost out. Those pushes hurt a lot! Baby was born at 8:45 am. Minor stitches and tearing. No drugs. Within a few minutes of her birth, I was talking about when we would have baby #2. It was way faster and easier than I expected. For prep, I *tried* doing perineal massage, but it was weird and uncomfortable so I didn't do it much. No other specific prep. Did a lot of walking and my body was still in pretty good shape from a long distance (6 months) hike the prior year. But I feel I just got lucky. I was healthy the whole pregnancy.
