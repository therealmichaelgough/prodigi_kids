Rumors started when a few famous people, like Jenny McCarthy, decided to jump off the rocker and start spouting a conspiracy theory that vaccines are causing autism\n2. A few quack doctors, particularly Andrew Jeremy Wakefield, published papers or don't believe in vaccination. Just because a couple doctors think it is wrong doesn't mean they have any merit. The original paper Wakefield published was retracted from the publisher, and it has been proven not only false, but a misleading lie.\n3. The rumors have propagated due partly to the overabundance of media attention given to people that disagree with vaccination. Another part of the kindling that is this wildfire of falseness that vaccines are not easy to understand by looking at them. I'm not a biologist or a chemist, and sharp needles scare me. But I also know that these vaccines are proven to work and work well.\n\nIf doctors/big pharma really wanted to do this to make money, they would be advising AGAINST getting vaccinated. The cost for a simple doctor's visit, especially if you're already there anyway, and the administering/supplies for a vaccine, is much MUCH cheaper than treatment and doctor or hospital visits for someone that actually managed to catch any of these diseases.\n\n[This article might be the most interesting to you](http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2013/The-Childhood-Immunization-Schedule-and-Safety.aspx). Quote from the conclusion in  the Report Brief (It looks like the full report is free too!)\n\n&gt; In this most comprehensive examination of the\nimmunization schedule to date, the IOM committee\nuncovered no evidence of major safety concerns\nassociated with adherence to the childhood immunization\nschedule, which should help to reassure a\ndiverse group of stakeholders. Indeed, rather than\nexposing children to harm, following the complete\nchildhood immunization schedule is strongly associated\n with reducing vaccine-preventable diseases.\n\nA few more:\n\n* http://www2.aap.org/immunization/families/safety.html\n* http://www.vaccines.gov/basics/safety/\n* http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/index.html", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1424412187, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "cor8hh9", "link_id": "t3_2whhw1", "parent_id": "t1_cor2l2a", "retrieved_on": 1424691004, "score": 7, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"archived": false, "author": "istara", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "Where are all these upset and offended parents who can't vaccinate for medical reasons and feel ostracised?
