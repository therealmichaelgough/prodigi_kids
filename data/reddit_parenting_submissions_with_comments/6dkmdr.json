Went to the hospital at 6 cm.  When they rechecked me shortly after, I was at 7.  I think I could have gone naturally, but it would have been brutal and quick.  Instead, I got the epidural.  As soon as it hit my legs, my natural endorphins kicked in.  It was fantastic.  I felt great!  I could still feel my baby, and I knew when to push.  No one counted in my face.  Since we were doing fine, everyone was quiet and just let me do my thing.  \n\nAll in all, a good memory.  (The peds nurse, on the other hand....super obnoxious.)

Water broke at 2:30am, contractions sent me to birth center at 8pm. I felt elation when I felt things were kicking into action. That intense excitement like a kid on Christmas Eve. \n\nThen serious contractions, I was very focused and wanted quiet during contractions. I wanted to chat and be normal in between. As labor kicked up, it turned into all focus. I zoned out, like I was all there and remember it, but time ceased to have meaning and I was only in the moment. I didn't realize until after that my husband waved a shower sprayer on my back for an hours! Seriously good pain relief. \n\nPushing just hurt. I was tired and so ready to be done. I wanted to throw up with each push. Then they told me I could feel his head. And I cried with joy, it was so powerful. It gave me the strength to keep going. And, of course, the best is when it's over and you hold your baby. It's such a joyous moment, seeing this kid's face after carrying him for so long. I cried then too. \n\nSecond baby: faster birth! Woke up to contractions at 3am, went in at 6am. More focused on my checklist to get everything we needed and kid 1 in care of grandparents. \n\nOnce I was at birth center, I got very zen and into the zone. Total silence was perfect. Then excitement when I realized how quickly I was progressing! Then painful pushing. It helped me to grab on to my husband and tell my nurse how much it hurt. She was sweet and having someone validate my pain was soothing. Then baby was here in 10 pushes (about 30 min)! I was so happy and less exhausted than my first birth. I yelled, \"we did it!\" to my husband and cried when I got to hold baby. The ending is just amazing. The bliss and awe over this tiny person is such a beautiful thing. \n\nI found the Bradley method book helpful in preparing for what labor would look/feel like. I knew that I'd likely have feelings of doubt or I can't do this right before the big moment and that helped me not feel so down when it came. Meditation would be helpful i think. Practicing just being. Acknowledging your passing thoughts/feelings but not being battered by them. I did tai chi previously and found that it helped me to draw on meditative imagery we had done there.

Before I got it, I was a mess. I had a toddler to take care of, so I was cranky and tired and was having contractions 2-5 min apart the entire time I was in labor! I ended up having to walk a circle around the maternity ward for 2hours before I started showing progress and was finally admitted to the hospital. I was grumpy, angry, and in pain, then ended up having to push for 2 1/2 hours after all that, (of course the epidural had worn off at this point) with me falling asleep between each contraction due to the sleep deprivation and exertion. And they still had to use the vacuum to finally get her out. Stubborn little thing. Ymmv, but I didn't really feel any joy or excitement until that child came out; then it was a sudden flood of happiness, strength (I just pushed a freaking human out of my body!), excitement that I made it through one of the hardest things I've ever done, and hunger since I couldn't eat with the epidural! And all the labor pain had disappeared almost immediately. It was such a huge relief. But, of course, everyone's labor is different. You may have an easy birth with no complications or hiccups whatsoever and be happy as a clam through all of it! You could also be like me with my first daughter. It was probably the most traumatic thing to happen to me to date. Mostly because I had an emergency c-section after only 8 hours of labor after I had told myself I would have, and prepared myself thoroughly for, a completely natural birth. I never really emotionally recovered from that birth since I wasn't even entertaining the possibility that I would have to get a c section. I was young and naive and woefully unprepared for that eventuality. I never read up on it-learned what to expect, recovery time, etc. I was also forced to be put out completely for the surgery, since an epidural or spinal would have taken too long to start working and the baby needed to get out NOW. It happened FAST! They literally had me sign the consent form for the surgery as I was passing out from the anesthesia on the operating table. I didn't get to see my baby until the next day since I couldn't walk because of the pain and my hospital bed wouldn't fit in the nicu. I couldn't even hold her until a few days after that. The first time I saw her face was a picture my mom took of her. My biggest piece of advice, if you're even still reading this, is to prepare for anything to happen. Your birth plan may just be thrown out the window, depending on so many factors that nobody could predict, or it may go exactly how you planned! Ask other women about their childbirth stories, and for advice on what to expect. I can only speak for myself, but I love to educate other women with my story (if this novel wasn't a big enough clue!) and hopefully I didn't scare you too bad with my crazy births! But the one thing I can guarantee is that the joy and ecstasy you feel when you see/hear your baby for the first time will supersede any negative emotions you may have felt during birth/labor/recovery!

And my labor nurse was so sweet, she kept telling me I was doing an awesome job and telling me how much longer I would have to push to get my little\u200b baby out. Once we got closer to her actually being born (I pushed for an hour and a half) there were a lot more people in the room. Like 3 nurses, my OB, a tech, and my husband, and everybody kept cheering me on and telling me I was pushing great. So that was really cool to be cheered on by a whole room of people, and that support made my birth a very positive experience. \n\nAnd then of course I had the excitement of knowing that if I push really hard and give it my all at every contraction (difficult with how exhausted pushing made me, but I focused on the outcome and not how tired I was) I'd get to meet my baby soon, so I did that and then she came out and it was incredible. Like my nurse commented that she loved the expressions I had made during labor and then when she was born I just had this look of utter amazement and disbelief. \n\nI was so nervous to give birth but everything went so much smoother than I imagined it would. I love thinking back to the whole experience, like all 29 hours haha.", "can_gild": true, "created_utc": 1495896127, "id": "di41wxa", "link_id": "t3_6dkmdr", "parent_id": "t3_6dkmdr", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Mommit", "subreddit_type": "public"}, {"author": "frigid_bones", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "It was.
