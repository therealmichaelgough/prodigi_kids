My milk came in fine, but it didn't come out fast enough for my son. He latched just fine, but would unlatch after a minute or two and scream until we gave him a bottle. It was just a taste of what was to come; despite the fact that I pumped religiously, I could not keep up with him and had to use formula by the time he was 6 weeks old. By 3 months, he was drinking literally over twice what the 'average' baby his size was drinking. (We couldn't go by age; by 3 months he was in 6-9 month clothes. So we went by size.) We'd been giving him vitamins since he was born (you know, the vitamin D stuff), and added more - other - vitamins on the recommendation of our pediatrician at two months. To no avail! The only thing left to do was introduce solid foods early and hope that helped him, because drinking over 100 ounces of formula/breast milk a day at 3 months is really not what's supposed to be happening. I gave up pumping entirely shortly after.\n\nTo sum up, my son will be three in January. He is currently in 4T, and that size just barely fits him. He can lift an entire gallon of liquid with one hand. His speech was slightly delayed, but it's taken off at light speed recently and his comprehension of language has always been a little ahead, despite the fact that he wasn't vocal. He's never been seriously sick in his life; he's had three or four colds and gotten a stomach bug that lasted all of 6 hours twice. In his entire life. He has no food allergies, no weak stomach, is not a picky eater, and does not require glasses.\n\nI couldn't tell you a single thing formula did to my son that was negative, unless you want to blame the slight asthma he seems to get when he gets colds on formula. (Which would be silly; my husband has asthma, and so does his mother.) In fact, formula probably saved us, since without it all I would have had the option of giving him at *6 weeks* would have been solid foods. Besides that, going straight to bottles allowed my husband to create a closer bond with our son immediately.\n\nBreast milk has its benefits; I can't deny that. But formula isn't going to hurt your son. Anyone giving you a hard time, with all you went through, is more concerned about being superior from their standards than the health of your child. Ignore them... or come up with some really stinging comebacks and use them all the time.

For breastfeeding proponents, this can be a hard line to walk - because educating about things like \"cluster feeding doesn't mean you have a supply problem\" also risks upsetting women who ran into that and started supplementing.  And people can get defensive about stuff that isn't directed at them - largely because an insane amount of pressure is put onto women to do everything exactly right or they're going to screw up their kids forever.  \n\nThe two links you posted about limiting formula access in the hospital, though, are not about judging mothers - it's about very real, measurable benefits to public health when it comes to breastfeeding, and trying to get hospitals to have policies that support that rather than undermining. I know for a stressed parent that wants formula for whatever reason, it sucks and feels judgey, but so many women who wanted to breastfeed have been undermined in our culture by nurses pushing formula (\"oh but your milk isn't in yet!\" or whatever).  I think our culture really has a way to go to find the proper balance between encouraging and supporting breastfeeding (making sure hospital practices aren't sabotaging new mothers), and not making formula moms feel awful about themselves.  It's true that in a lot of cases that balance hasn't been struck.  But I really and truly think most of it is not personal, and that to some extent we allow ourselves to take things personally and feel judged when we shouldn't.\n\nFor a long time here, the cultural norm has not been breastfeeding. As a result, most of us who do face real lack of support problems: mothers and grandmothers who question our supply and freak us out, close family acting like you're crazy for BFing past three weeks or whatever arbitrary number they have in mind, random strangers giving us dirty looks while we fumble with a nursing cover, friends who ask when we're starting formula if we dare rant about pumping 6 times a day because of a supply flux, aunties asking why we don't buy baby milk from the store because \"he's so small,\" etc.  All that is still really, really, really pervasive.  I think there's some lactivist types, and public health types, who may be too gung ho to try and swing the pendulum the other way.  But there's a point at which, in any parenting debate, you can either allow yourself to feel bad about stuff beyond your control, or you can flip the bird to it and go on your merry way, you know?\n\n\n", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1384811867, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "cdhg8de", "link_id": "t3_1qwxxn", "parent_id": "t1_cdhfbgd", "retrieved_on": 1428605613, "score": 30, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"archived": true, "author": "Aa_is_for_Aardvark", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "I think I'd run out of my house if a 6mo spoke to me.

For those of us who wanted to breastfeed and couldn't, it's often a big deal.  That \"breast is best\" campaign has worked for a lot of us.  We want to do what's best for our babies, we learn and prepare to do what's best, and then our bodies don't cooperate and we feel like we failed.  Then, on top of that, how many times have you heard/read someone say something along the lines of, \"Almost all women can exclusively breastfeed.  REAL supply problems are very rare.  Most women who struggle with supply do so because of poor support/unnecessary c-sections/lack of education/doctors pushing supplementation too early/etc, and if they'd just had the proper support and kept trying it would have been fine.\"?  When you read that dozens of times over the course of your pregnancy, and then your baby is hungry and your breasts aren't producing and you end up using formula, you have this nagging doubt in the back of your head.  We all have a tendency to assume rare things won't happen to us, and that comes into play here: you end up going back over your birth and early postpartum period, thinking \"what if?\"  What could I have done differently?  Which choice did I make that ruined that breastfeeding relationship?  Was it the epidural, the emergency c-section, listening to the pediatrician who recommended supplementing, not asking for a different lactation consultant?  At least for me, telling my long story is my way of coming to terms with my unsuccessful attempt at EBF.  I think it's very similar to the need many of us feel to tell our birth stories: storytelling is how we process it.\n\nEdit:  I'm tempted, but I will refrain from getting up on my soapbox at this point and complaining about how damagingly overboard the \"breast is best\" campaign is (it's written on the formula cans for god's sake), but suffice it to say, as I process, I'm feeling less of a need to tell my story and more of a need to work to change how we support all mothers.
