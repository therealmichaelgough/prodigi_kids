This falls under the category of attachment issues, your parents passed on a crummy attachment relationship to you and so your blueprint for parent/child relationships isn't what you want. \n\nIt IS changeable, but takes a good amount of work. I suggest Attachment Focused EMDR (AF EMDR). EMDR is an amazing technique that heals trauma, and AF EMDR deals specifically with healing trauma in the attachment  blueprints a person is drawing from. \n\nOthers mentioned Parenting From The Inside Out, and it is fantastic. Circle of Security is also good, as well as the Positive Parenting Program (Triple P). DBT also works well in learning tools to get control over your emotions. \n\nThe EMDR heals the root cause of things, and the others teach tools to cope in healthier ways. If you'd like help finding a therapist near you that specializes in this I'd love to help. \n\nIf finances are an issue there are lots of sliding scale community counseling centers. But this type of issue doesn't tend to resolve on its own, I really, really recommend therapy. You can save your daughter from all the pain your parents put you through. Think of it as investing in her wellbeing and future, I can tell you, having a mom who sets a healthy emotional tone for her life is as valuable as other costs, like quality childcare or college.

My mom was also really hard on me about everything from school, personal goals, the thickness of my thighs, etc. Now, I'm a mom of two boys and I've tried very hard to not have such high expectations because believe me, it's made me so much harder on myself, especially as an adult. The thing is, life has a funny sense of humor, and I've been gifted with children who don't really want to keep up with the \"normal\" milestones. Both my boys don't really talk well, they're intelligent beyond belief, but their words aren't very clear. My eldest son wouldn't go to the potty until he was 3 (nearing 4) and he still prefers to sleep in our room on a mattress. I find myself lashing out when I get frustrated because I can't always understand my eldest kid, or because he struggles with basic things.. But I remember how small my mom made me feel, and try better next time. I don't always get it right, and usually, the last hour before their bedtime is my worst.

This is variable by area, it may turn up some great leads or basically nothing. \n\nThird, you can go to [211.com](https://211.com) and look for mental healthcare. They will have links to local mental health centers most of which will either take state insurance or have a serious sliding scale. You will likely have a better time finding EMDR therapists if you look in women's shelters/domestic violence focused centers. \n\nYou can also look into if you qualify for coverage from the Victim's Compensation Fund.

Not once. I crumbled in guild and self-hate if I misbehaved and she *sighed* or raised a disapproving eyebrow. She was approving and patient, too. But I felt her so cold, distant, untouchable. She was subtly controlling and left us very little intimacy, for our protection... Puberty was horrible, I tried everything to get her to simply react, show any \"bad\" emotion, show her feelings. She's still struggling with that at well over 60yo. I struggle a LOT with keeping my cool with the kids, but I kind of \"get\" her now that I also raise my kids alone. I still resent her for some things but the sheer effort she made was barely human, I realize now.", "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "created_utc": 1544647240, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "ebnk5cg", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_a5c86c", "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t1_ebmhb1z", "permalink": "/r/Mommit/comments/a5c86c/when_you_are_the_toxic_parent/ebnk5cg/", "retrieved_on": 1544647241, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"approved_at_utc": null, "author": "lerrik", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_ia51n", "author_patreon_flair": false, "banned_at_utc": null, "body": "Apologize. \"I'm sorry.
