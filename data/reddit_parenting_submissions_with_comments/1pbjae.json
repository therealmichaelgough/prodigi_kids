I plan on doing something similar to lose my pregnancy weight, and I'm already down 25 pounds (granted, 8 pounds 12 ounces of that was baby!).  I am a little nervous about calorie intake while breastfeeding (also EBF), I really don't want to mess with my supply.  For me, maintenance is around 1500 to 1700 calories, so I'm trying to eat 2000-2300 per day so far.  I don't want to really start trying to lose until baby is 2 months, though, so I can be 100% confident that my supply has established and balanced out.\nNo real advice, just wanted to share some camaraderie!\n", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1382908438, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "cd0uupl", "link_id": "t3_1pbjae", "parent_id": "t3_1pbjae", "retrieved_on": 1428962980, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"archived": true, "author": "Surely_Jackson", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "I gained about 75 pounds too.

You need to create healthy routines and make them habit.

It can be a slow process, but you're doing all the right things and you are sure to have the results you're looking for.

Everybody's body is somewhat different but my experience is that aerobic exercise only helps me to a point. I have had much better results maintaining a healthy weight by doing some simple free weight and body-weight exercises 3 times a week for 20-30 mins at a time.  I start with 2 sets of 3 [core exercises](http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/core-strength/SM00047) and then do simple body weight exercises like push-ups, dips, and squats, and maybe some simple exercises using a hand weight such as bicep &amp; tricep curls, flyes, military presses, etc.  I use an exercise ball too but honestly you can get a decent workout in with no equipment at all.  If you don't know how to do the exercises (or just want to try something different), the [Fitdeck body weight cards](http://shop.fitdeck.com/fitdeck-bodyweight.html) are a nice starting point because they have pictures &amp; instructions.  \n\nThe core stuff will help rebuild a bunch of muscles that got weak during your pregnancy &amp; will help you avoid injury while lifting your little one. And the other weight exercises will help you build muscle - which requires more calories to maintain &amp; this helps you burn through them faster when not exercising.  \n\nOther simple habits that have helped me maintain a healthy weight:\n\n- not skipping meals, and mostly eating food prepared at home\n\n- drinking 32oz water in the course of each day - this helps with the milk supply incidentally, but it also helps in weight control if you need to cut out empty calories like sodas or extra alcohol.\n\nLastly, I am in the camp of avoiding fad diet trends or dramatic alterations in what you eat (like eliminating whole food groups). This kind of thing is awfully hard to sustain long term and the diets aren't always good for you. You'll have more success long term if you can identify bad habits &amp; cut them out (those sugary sodas, for ex.), and identify good habits and work then in (like figuring out some simple healthy go-to entrees to prepare at home even when life is totally chaotic).\n\n", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1382982020, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "cd1gbgh", "link_id": "t3_1pbjae", "parent_id": "t3_1pbjae", "retrieved_on": 1428952753, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "[deleted]", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1382988932, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "cd1j894", "link_id": "t3_1pbjae", "parent_id": "t1_cd0xilf", "retrieved_on": 1428951346, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "[deleted]", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1382989799, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "cd1jlpu", "link_id": "t3_1pbjae", "parent_id": "t1_cd0xgcs", "retrieved_on": 1428951172, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "[deleted]", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1382990013, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "cd1jp4f", "link_id": "t3_1pbjae", "parent_id": "t1_cd0wboa", "retrieved_on": 1428951127, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"archived": true, "author": "vtlatria", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "Yes, ketones don't pass through breastmilk", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1382990891, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "cd1k2yr", "link_id": "t3_1pbjae", "parent_id": "t1_cd1jp4f", "retrieved_on": 1428950936, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "I gained 55 pounds.
