It's light and easy to move from room to room. My son slept in it next to our bed for the first 4 months before we moved him to his crib. A good playmat will help keep them entertained and help with tummy time. Someone sent me a nursing nightgown for the hospital and it was so nice to have instead of using the hospital gown. She got it at Target. The bouncer was great for us as well. Also invest in a good baby carrier that is easy to use. Some babies want to be held all the time and sometimes you need your hands. The pack and play was a waste for us. We hardly used it. Just remember you can return anything you don't like or use. Good luck!

Have a few kinds of diapers on hand, but it is trial and error as to what works best. We used Huggies Newborn which were fantastic, and Pampers size one which were fine. Huggies size one suck for us, and Kirkland size 1-2 did too for a bit (Costco brand), but now we use Kirkland size 1-2 and Pampers size 2 overnights. :P\n\nAt the hospital, have a game plan. Do you want people visiting right after? Give yourself time to recover and rest, and if you don't want visitors, just tell them, \"We'll let you know when we are ready for visitors.\" \n\nI also brought my own tea as I am picky. I brought a microwaveable heat pad, too, and some cream that helped with pain management. I also had a cold towel that I soak in cold water and it stays cold, but not dripping or damp, for hours, and that was amazing on my neck. OH, and a doughnut pillow to sit on--use it at home, but bring it to the hospital and leave it in the car. Sitting on my seat was hell. I wish I had that damn pillow with me. Bring a water bottle with a straw. It will make it easier to sip on. Ask the nurses after labour for pain meds and for a stool softener. Get on top of that asap, and take it for the first few days.\n\nI downloaded Baby Connect which helped keep me sane. It keeps track of nursing, diapers, pumping, sleep, etc. Doctors and nurses will ask you how long and how frequently baby is sleeping, eating and pooping, and this will help you keep track and also figure out why s/he is crying.\n\nWe don't use mittens as our guy likes to self soothe, but you may want some as baby nails are sharp. A hat and blanket, just in case for the weather, and going home clothes for you--remember that these will be maternity, as you'll still look about six months pregnant. \n\nOur hospital gave me mesh underwear and giant pads, and I got to keep my peri bottle (spray it on your lady bits while you're peeing). I used a few frozen pads--doused with witch hazel--but they warmed too quickly to be too effective. You can freeze things like popcorn kernels or even a cold/hot pack and wrap that in a towel and press it against your sore bits after, and that works well. I also went to the Depends underwear site and got a few free samples, and I used these in conjunction with overnight maxi pads (buy a giant box, you will need them). The depends are comfortable, much more so than regular underwear. After a while, the mesh don't work as well with the hospital pads when you're moving around, so the depends with a maxi pad in them are great.\n\nHope that helps--good luck!", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1416848401, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "cmbox2c", "link_id": "t3_2n7jmg", "parent_id": "t1_cmbcafr", "retrieved_on": 1425864504, "score": 2, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"archived": false, "author": "Paigeisacult", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "Loads of help!
