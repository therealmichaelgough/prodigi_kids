My husband and I both work 9-5 jobs, so usually at the end of the day he'll watch the baby while I make dinner. But sometimes he works late, and I'd like to get dinner started at the usual time, but I really don't know how to accomplish this.\n\nOur kitchen is really closed off from the rest of the house, so I can't keep an eye on him if he's playing in another room. He's not quite crawling yet but he rolls and scoots enough to get into trouble if we're not nearby. The kitchen is also really cramped, so there's not really any place to put him on the floor in there. I can put him in an exersaucer in the kitchen, but he'll get bored with that before long. Same with a high chair - I can give him some puffs to munch on but again this only holds interest for so long before he screams to get down. Keeping him restrained in something for the entire 30-45 minutes it would take me to cook just doesn't seem possible.
