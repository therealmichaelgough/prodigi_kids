Like, everyone has an opinion, and an experience that they must relay to someone else as being the worst, possible scenario. \n\nI'll set the scene....\n\nMy 6yo son is with his Montessori group at the local pool. I get a voicemail that says my son \"...pushed another child's head underwater and is no longer allowed to swim for the remainder of the day. The child that had his head pushed underwater is now very afraid to go back into the water.\" Obviously, I go to the pool to pick him up and he is sitting on his towel amongst all of the other children and am met by a young girl (one of his normal counselors) and the owner. \n\nI know I looked disappointed, because I was. His counselor asked me if I got her voicemail, I said I did. The owner then walked up and asked if her counselor had explained to me what happened. I said she had. I then began asking specifics about what happened, starting with if my son dunked the little boy's head or if my son held his head underwater. The owner then gave me a pretty decent brow-beating and began to recount the time she had her head held underwater and how that still terrifies her, and began to explain how she told the little boy that story. She explained to the little boy how that had happened to her and she's scarred for life because of it. \n\nIn my head, I was thinking: \"I don't care you had your head held underwater when you were little. I don't care. I truly don't. I could NOT care less.\" \n\nShe hadn't answered my question, so instead of repeating myself, which can come off rude, I attempt to rephrase my question - so I asked: \"Do we know if they were fighting or arguing? Was my son mad or had they been playing?\" My intentions were to understand the situation, understand where my son may have been coming from. It wasn't to shift blame, or to minimize what had happened. \n\nThe owner start stammering and stuttering, I could tell she was shocked I had asked that. She said it didnt matter, he could have seriously hurt him. She then proceeded to walk away, then repeat what I had asked her to another counselor and shake her head like I was a complete idiot. This was done about ten feet away. \n\nMy son and I left, and I asked him what happened. He said he had dunked his friend underwater and his friend said nothing. When they got out for break, his friend tattled on him, then his counselor came over and told him to sit next to the owner. He added he and his friend and the counselor were walking to the restroom at break and his friend told the counselor it was an accident, and my son corrected him and said it was on purpose.\n\nAfter he told me this, I took him to get an ice cream cone. When we are in our pool, we dunk each other. I told him this was an important lesson about keeping your hands to yourself. I dont think he meant any malice, or intended any harm, but I also know what he did was wrong.\n\nI'll tell you why I'm annoyed.\n\nI'm annoyed that the owner had to recount her horrific childhood incident to everyone, making the incident about her, therefore intensifying her feelings of irritation towards my son. I'm annoyed that no one could answer any of my questions about what happened because none of them saw it. I'm also annoyed that I felt judged by merely asking for details and clarification. To me, that's what I should be doing. Asking questions, finding out what happened, understanding where everyone is coming from. \n\nThe owner added she didn't think the parents of the little boy my son dunked were going to be very happy. If I could have texted her my thoughts, it would have read: \"k.\"\n\nDoes anyone see where I'm coming from?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3", "subreddit_subscribers": 78162, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "As a mom, I need to know I'm not an anomaly.", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1564262435, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/ci8og8/as_a_mom_i_need_to_know_im_not_an_anomaly/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, "comments": [{"all_awardings": [], "approved_at_utc": null, "author": "tardisgater", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3vp1j", "author_patreon_flair": false, "banned_at_utc": null, "body": "This really sounds unprofessional.

Then the aggressor would get a time out if they were being malicious about it, or we kept playing if it was accidental. \n\nI know my story has no effect on the counselors experience..... And that's exactly true for her story with regards to your son's situation. It's understandable that she would be more sensitive to this type of situation when she has a lasting memory of a similar situation. It's understandable that she feels strongly about pool safety. However, she is not teaching anyone anything by banning the kid from the pool, and I think the only case where that would be appropriate is if a child has been observed doing this behavior with an obvious mal intent three times. A three strikes rule would be understandable. But your son and the other kid both were playing it sounds like, and just got carried away. It happens. It also sounds like both boys communicated with each other about it and resolved it. Which is more than the counselor and owner did. All they taught the boys was that their feelings/accounts of the truth were unimportant and don't matter to these adults. That's a problem because in the future if an event occurs that does require adult mediation,these kids may not go to an adult because they feel it won't matter because those adults don't care to listen to them. \n\nAlso, I'm sorry but a person who has a traumatic relationship with water and said she is still afraid of water to this day....
