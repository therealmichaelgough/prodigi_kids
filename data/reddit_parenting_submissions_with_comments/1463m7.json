Nonetheless, it never made sense to me. If I were to hit someone for doing something *I* found bad, *I* would get in trouble. Why, then, can my parents?\nEverytime I got a spanking, I felt that it was unjustified (ie I say a bad word and you can physically punish me? THAT makes no sense!). What do we do to people who break the law? We put them in adult time out.\nSince having babies in my life, I see how easy it is to resort to slapping/smacking/spanking. Hell, I've flicked my nephew's cheek when he was biting his older brother. I felt seriously guilty afterwards.\nI have two women in my life that I'm close to. Both are mothers.\nMomma 1 is the mother to two. She has physically punished her children since they could reach (grab hair = smack on the hand, etc). Once, when her oldest pushed me as he was running out of the room (I was an obstacle in the doorway), he wouldn't apologize, wouldn't stay in his room, etc. All because I was in his way as he was running out (devastated he couldn't have sweets prior to dinner), he ended up getting SMACKED at least 8 times. (once for not going to his room, once for coming out too early, once for telling his mother no, a couple of times for not apologizing to me when prompted) it was ridiculous, and completely unnecessary.\nMomma 2 is the mother of one. Anytime her child has done something punishable (grabbed hair, thrown toys, slapped, scratched, screamed), M2 is there, picks her up, talks to her, explains what she did was wrong and WHY it was wrong. It takes longer for this type of guidance to take effect, sure...but isn't instant gratification a total issue in our society, anyways? It took a couple of months for her to break the habit of hitting, but M2's child has NOT hit anyone since the change took place.\nM1's children constantly hit each other and her, still! \n\nI've decided what I'm going to do when I raise my children. Spanking WILL be a last resort (not proverbial, but REAL last resort). Again, sure what has been deemed \"nonviolent parenting\" takes longer to instill a message into the child, it has proven time and time again that it's the choice for me.\n\nNo judgment on anyone who has differing views, please don't attack mine.", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1358549409, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "c7zg09d", "link_id": "t3_1463m7", "parent_id": "t3_1463m7", "retrieved_on": 1431007112, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"archived": true, "author": "loki93009", "author_flair_css_class": "purple", "author_flair_text": "3.5 years old", "body": "This is the best thought out response I've read.

Only rarely, because usually the threat was enough to bring my brother and I to a halt. But Mum had a wooden tool that she had used for pottery, and it was \"The Stick\". When we were kids, it looked like a friggin 2x4.\n\nI don't think the spanking badly affected me. I know that I would hit other people when I was a teenager, but my boyfriend (now husband) made it very clear that he wouldn't tolerate it at all, and so I've stopped completely now.\n\nThat said, my Mum has always told me that she had to spank me because I was a particularly difficult child. She would tell me all these horrible things I would do, and so I've always grown up with this notion that I was particularly difficult. Now that I have a child of my now, not only do I see her doing the exact same things, but I see lots of other kids her age doing those things as well, and worse. I'm coming to the conclusion that it wasn't that I was particularly difficult, it was that my Mum couldn't cope with me.\n\nIt never made sense to me to hit a child. It stops them in the moment, sure, but in the longer term, the child just learns that hitting is an acceptable method of dealing with anger and frustration. In particular, at the moment, my daughter is two and tries to hit me out of frustration. My response to that cannot be to hit her back. \n\nSo we aren't a spanking family now, and probably won't ever be. We have a \"naughty chair\" in the corner, and just the mention of it is usually enough to stop her in her tracks. She even goes and sits in it herself when she knows she's been naughty. So I find it to be effective, so far. It's harder when we're out, because there can't be an immediate response to her bad behavior, but I just either pick her up and walk off, or walk away from her and wait for her to catch up. \n\nBut anyway, that's my experience.

I had tons of issues with hitting people, all the way through high school. I'm 27 now and my Mom still says I \"was always a hitter\", and I have video proof of me all smiley at my 5th birthday and my sister walks by and WAM! I just punch her for no reason. My sister always got most of the hits, and I wonder where I got the inspiration to always be mean to her... Needless to say I'm very thankful to a dear friend who helped me work through my issues last year or two in high school! When I had my daughter 3.5 years ago, all the over tired and strained nerves brought back all the old issues and it took a lot of effort to handle the aggression. Luckily I had sense enough to see it's a baby and if things got overwhelming it was better to leave her in her crib crying and walk away for 5 minutes. Now that she's older and has a 1.5 year old brother I find myself swatting her butt now (not spanking) quite a bit because she's causing harm to her brother. Only a few times have I actually given her a spanking because she's pushed him over/done something that caused him to cut his lip open or left serious bite marks. I've recognized that I need to quit with the swatting and have been working on being a lot calmer again and I've really restricted it to only really important times, but just putting her in her room is a lot more effective punishment than a swat!\"\n\nOverall I don't think spanking is effective, and it only leads to a bad example of how to deal with emotions. (As if a young child doesn't already have problems with dealing with emotions!) Every time I've hit her I felt terrible, although it felt so justified at the moment when she could have really caused serious pain (and caused blood) to her brother. I think the biggest thing for me to stop is knowing how even though it felt like I had dealt with everything years ago, it still is something I have to constantly deal with today whenever they get too much.

Think of again, schools with 25 children and one teacher maintaining control.  Kids with ADHD, kids who hit, kids with mental issues.. They do not spank to keep order!   If you think there are no other options, well you have the Internet!  Google proper discipline techniques, read a goddamned parenting book.  There's tons out there!  Don't do it for me, do it for your child!\n\nI am appalled and sickened at all of you who PLAN to physically harm your child as a punishment, and don't say \"a swat on the butt is not harming them\".  While there might not be bruises It is still you physically hitting your child for a negative reason no matter how gentle YOU think it is.   The mental developmental wounds can go far deeper than physical ones.  \n\nTo those of you spanked who turned out fine, great! And i think im ok too, but let me tell you about the night my mother cried hours on end when she realized I wouldn't sit in the front of the car anymore because she was in slapping distance of my face.   She felt so guilty because I now feared her touch instead of wanting it.  Is that how you want to earn your child's respect?  Down vote if you like.  As others have mentioned, studies back my point and when I'm not on my phone I will gladly provide links.  \n\n", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1354498846, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": 1354590122, "gilded": 0, "id": "c7a9ifm", "link_id": "t3_1463m7", "parent_id": "t3_1463m7", "retrieved_on": 1430561128, "score": -6, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"archived": true, "author": "loki93009", "author_flair_css_class": "purple", "author_flair_text": "3.5 years old", "body": "Why do you feel it's effective?

The temptation may be to stop walking over to the table because now they did what you said, but my advice is don't stop- Follow through.  You walk over to that table and even if they are on the floor, you take them over and set them on the couch or whatever.  \"The table is not for climbing.\" Always follow through, none of that counting crap, that's for the lazy.

And I tend to think spanking is one of those things people do when they just are out of other ideas or are angry. Neither of which make it particularly useful.\n\nI also watched my little brothers growing up - they did get spanked, usually by their dad.  Granted I was a lowly teenager, but my observation on the spankings was that it was usually the result of their dad not being attentive. You could see most of the misbehavior coming a mile away - it would slowly ratchet up, until suddenly it was obvious and stepdad would spank.  What seemed pretty obvious to me at the time was that it was probably a lot easier and more effective to redirect things before they reached the point of getting out of control.  When I watched them by myself, had NO problems with them and never had to resort to it.  But it took being very attentive.\n\nThe other observation I made is that there are subtexts to spanking.  1 - that people who are bigger can use their size - might makes right, and it's OK to hit people who are smaller than you  and 2 - when you're angry it's OK to hit.\n\nThe dumbest thing I ever saw was stepdad spanking because middle brother hit baby brother.  Um, yeah, you're teaching him hitting people smaller than you is bad by... hitting people smaller than you? \n\nNow both boys turned out great, I don't think they were scarred for life or anything, but watching that stuff just made it seem like spanking was not the best choice to making ones point.  \n\nI understand the frustration that comes with getting little kids to listen sometimes, but my goal is to be attentive, so I can head things off as often as possible, and creative, so that I can find a more positive way to shape behavior.  \n\nI think whether people spank or not, it is really, really important to lay down LOTS of positive reinforcement and reward for good behavior.
