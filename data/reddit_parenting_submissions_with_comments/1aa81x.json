First my husband took off time to help, then my mom came up for a week, and then his mom, who's retired, came up for over a month, all to help with my son, and give me time to recover.\n\nThat was... difficult, to say the least, but I at least expected my son to be safe. She's insanely paranoid about everything - you know the type. Always bundled up, even if he's sweating, freaking out if he so much as touches a power cord. Drove me nuts, but I trusted her.\n\nAnd...\n\nI've been giving my son this liquid yogurt stuff in a sippy cup for some time now. But, I learned an age ago, it's damned hard to clean if it goes even a day without cleaning. So I had a system. I had 1 designated sippy cup for yogurt, cleaned immediately after use, 1 sippy cup for juice, a little less stringently cleaned, and the rest were water only. If the juice or yogurt sippy cups couldn't be found, he just didn't get any.\n\nWhen my back went out, I warned each of them, in order (hubby, mom, MIL), about the yogurt, about how hard the sippy cups are to clean, and how important it is to take the valve out *every time* in order to clean them. They all agreed like I was talking about the obvious, so I was satisfied.\n\nI've not been able to clean the cups in 3 months. His mom's gone, and I'm finally getting back on my feet. My son and husband have been getting sick a lot this last month, but I figured something was probably going around at his work. I've only just gotten back to mine.\n\nSo late last night:\n\nI got up to soothe the little man during his nightly crying bouts, and I noticed his crib sippy cup was almost out of water, so I decided to refill him another one, and swap out.\n\nAs was my usual practice from those months ago, I pulled off the lid and valve to check inside before filling it...\n\nBlack mold. OMG. Next one.\n\nThe same. Forgive my yelling, but, *EVERY SIPPY CUP IN THE HOUSE HAD BLACK MOLD IN THE VALVES*. One of them had a thick crust of yogurt inside the nipple! I slipped into his room and stole his sippy cup, afraid of what I'd see, but hoping at least it was okay. Nope, it had a huge chunk of black in it! That one was so thick, it was a colony a full cm across!\n\nI almost broke down crying. My husband likes to \"Demonstrate\" to my son how to drink from the sippy cup, to encourage him to drink more... that must be why he's been getting sick. Why my son's been pretty much perpetually sick for a month.\n\nI spent the next two hours, nevermind that it was the middle of the night, boiling and steaming the damned things, trying to get rid of the black mold. I got one - just *one*, of seven of them - satisfactorily cleaned, but the rest, 2 hours of intensive work couldn't get rid of the black stuff. The valves are too small to clean out with a brush/sponse, it's soaking/treatment + rinsing only. Though I resorted to chopsticks...\n\nHis stupid, paranoid, overprotective, practically abusive, she's so obsessive and pushy, mom... she freaking blew me off! She ignored my system, and failed to clean the sippy cups, despite my initial warning, and later protests (for instance, she would keep the leftover yogurt in the sippy cup in the fridge for up to a day, to prevent food wastage, whereas with me, if he didn't finish it within an hour, it was dumped and cleaned. We had a talk about that and she *promised* me that she was being very careful to clean them)\n\nI'm thinking of dumping all the damned sippy cups and replacing them entirely. I don't know if I can trust them, after being that slime encrusted and hard to clean...\n\nI know you guys will know my pain. Just thought I'd share. I'm glad his mom's not staying with us right now, because getting arrested for first degree murder would probably not help our situation.\n\n**TL;DR** My MIL ignored my warnings about how critically important it is to clean the sippy cups before they get hard to clean, while they were up here helping me recover from a back injury. Three months later, I discover black mold in all of my son's sippy cups.\n\nEdit: For note, while my husband did, admittedly, fail to closely examine the nozzles and valves, he did resume the system, and did resume cleaning out the sippy cups after every use. If they hadn't already been thick with mold, so thick that a soak and rinse apparently does nothing, there would be no problem.\n\n**Edit**: The original post also added my mother in the blame. But I really have no reason to believe she was responsible at all - she left as soon as my MIL arrived, about 6 weeks ago, and the boys didn't start getting sick till about a week after my MIL got here.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I'm so incredibly furious at my MIL...", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/1aa81x/im_so_incredibly_furious_at_my_mil/", "user_reports": []}, "comments": [{"archived": true, "author": "opprobrious77", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "Oh my goodness!

Some yogurts are made with A. niger as a fermenting agent, but even if another fermenting agent is used, if your yogurt contains citric acid or fructose or was made in a facility where other yogurts are made, it's almost certainly \"contaminated\" with A. niger, deliberately or accidentally.  When you see citric acid on the ingredients list of a food... Guess where that comes from?  Hint:  It's not from lemons.\n\nThere are lots of black or blackish molds in the world, but when it comes to food, it's usually this one behind anything distinctly black.  It grows fast and dominates most other fungi in a mixed population, which is actually a good thing.  Unlike many other possible contaminants it is \"generally recognized as safe\" to eat/drink (GRAS is an actual FDA label), although it's not healthy to inhale in high concentrations and some people have an allergic reaction to it.  On the flip side of that coin, A. niger is being researched as a potential treatment for certain digestive diseases due to its ability to \"out-populate\" potentially harmful gut bacteria.\n\nWhile drinking nasty mold is decidedly unappetizing, it's not necessarily harmful and it's not likely the reason your son and husband have been coughing unless there's some other source of it in your house where it's dry, abundant and becoming airborne... or they're having an allergic reaction.  Both possible, but unlikely.  Even if this is some completely different mold, coughing is a pretty specific immune response to *respiratory* irritation, inflammation, congestion, etc., so that's probably something else, too.  If I had a dollar for every cold and flu my husband and kids have shared that I have \"miraculously\" avoided, I'd... well, I'd have $20 or so.  Not much when you look at it that way, but I'm happy to have dodged those bullets.\n\nOh, and a few drops of blood?

I had to bend over and take her idiocy when my back was out, because I couldn't care for my son, but I will not do so normally.\n\nThe thing is, while I'm willing to compromise (albeit begrudgingly), she's simply not. She's right, because she's raised three successful children (all of whom have mental challenges, btw. My husband was borderline suicidal and had serious self esteem issues) She's never wrong, her idiotic opinions are \"common sense\" and science has obviously screwed up when it disagrees with her.\n\nShe refuses to be reasoned with, she refuses to compromise, she refuses to accept that I have any authority as a mom. She outright said she wasn't going to listen to my rules. She yelled at me for disagreeing with her.

She needs to sit down and shut up in my house, accept that I'm the woman of the house, and accept, acknowledge, and follow my authority.

I like technology (she's not a fan of me letting him play with my phone), I don't like TV (she had him watch Sesame Street *two hours a day* while she was here, even though I kept asking her to stop, and finally gave up, since it was only a month), I'm a robot (I have asperger's syndrome and a love of researching things), and the biggest problem? I'm not Catholic. I'm atheist, actually, so I'm obviously a baby eating monster.\n\nSorry, this got long.
