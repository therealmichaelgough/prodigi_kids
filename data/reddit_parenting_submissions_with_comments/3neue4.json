Nothing like clothes or diapers for baby. I am not a mom myself so I don't know what goes on with your body after giving birth. (I heard something about a cream for your nipples?!! I saw \"padsicles\" on pinterest?! lol) Are there certain things you ladies would have liked to receive for yourself?\n\nAlso, I'm asking because my sister just told our family that she's pregnant! I am super super thrilled and obviously way ahead of time in asking my question haha. \n\n\n*Edit- The response from this subreddit has been abundantly great! I now have a better understanding of what would comfort a mother who just gave birth. Be it through her own time to catch some zzz's, a nice relaxing herbal bath with candles, a clean house to come home to,  favorite snacks and a big water bottle in reach, easy prepped meals or yummy take-out, and things to help with baby- uhm boppy? I just learned what the heck that was- awesome! Obviously there was way more discussed in here and every single suggestion was definitely saved :) Even though her journey's just begun, we all can't wait!!\n\nKeep on rockin', moms! &lt;3", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Mothers of Reddit, what gifts could one buy a first time mom after she delivers?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/3neue4/mothers_of_reddit_what_gifts_could_one_buy_a/"}, "comments": [{"author": "alienabuilder", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "I gave three of my friends lockets.
