My family has a tradition of using 3 different girl names for every generation. They are Ann, Leigh, and Helen or variants of. The family legend goes we have been using these names for about 3,000 yrs, beginning in ancient Greece with Helena, Ann getting added sometime down the line and Leigh coming in last when we emigrated to England.   \nAnyway ever since I was a child and made aware of the tradition, I picked out Annabelle Grace as how I would honour the tradition. I am a Leigh, my Mother is a Leigh and my Grandmother and Greatgrandmother were Ann's. So I thought it would be nice to go back to Ann plus I personally don't like Helen. Just never liked the sound of it.    \nI am now pregnant with my first child and my brother's wife was also pregnant with their first child. They just had their baby a few days ago and guess what her name was.... Annebelle Jane.    \nI guess I should've seen it coming and had a talk with them about baby names since we're all very traditional and wish to continue the tradition. I am trying to be happy for them and excited about my new niece but it was like a blow to my stomach when I first heard her name. It feels distressing after imagining my baby girl for so many years to realise I'll never call her my sweet Annabelle.    \nI know I'm hormonal and this is not the end of the world and I should calm down but every time I try to come up with a new name I end up in tears.     \nWe still have 4 months until my due date so we have some time to find a new name and get used to it.  \nI am hoping you guys can help me come with some new names that use Ann or Leigh or both of them.  \nMy husband has suggested just naming her Annabelle Grace anyway since I wanted that name so much but I saw the fights between my mother and my aunt when I was young over baby names for my sisters and cousins and I really don't want a repeat of that in this generation nor do I want to fight with my brother and his wonderful wife.  \nSo Mommit, please help me!", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Help with baby names!", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/1gg24z/help_with_baby_names/", "user_reports": []}, "comments": [{"archived": true, "author": "eye-eye", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "Hannalei or Annalei?
