I have taught 2nd grade, which at 7 years old, is either the grade at or one above where your kid is. My insight is this: as a second grade teacher, I never just give a worksheet to a group of students and expect them to read and follow the directions on their own. I go over the instructions with the class, usually do a problem or two as examples, and then I'll ask a student (whoever looks least likely to have been paying attention) to repeat the directions back to me. In this way, I know that the students know what to do. In my experience, this is how most first and second grade teachers operate.\n\nOne of two things happened here: either the teacher didn't explain the directions clearly, or your kid wasn't paying attention. My guess is the latter, and as is typical of kids that age, when (s)he started working on it, instead of thinking, uh-oh, I'm not sure what to do so I'd better ask the teacher, your kid thought, uh-oh, I'm not sure what to do but I'm too embarrassed or scared to ask so I'll just wing it. It's not a big deal, honestly; shit happens, especially this close to the end of the school year. But that red X is an indicator that the teacher thinks your kid, for whatever reasons, wasn't following directions. Did your kid do the worksheet \"wrong\"? Not necessarily, (s)he just didn't do what the teacher was expecting. At the very least, the answer demonstrates good creative thinking and problem-solving skills. \n\nThat said, I think what you did is the exact right thing. You let your kid know that you understand what they were thinking, that the answer they gave is not necessarily wrong, it just wasn't what was expected for that worksheet. And keeping the lines of communication open with the teacher is awesome. \n\nIs the teacher going to change the X? Probably not. But one worksheet doesn't make or break a grade. Besides which, given the X -- as opposed to a proper score -- I'd guess this wasn't even taken for a grade. \n\nI read this post a few hours ago and saw the argument that had started and was a little wary of posting.

As you have written it though - lacking such a strong prior - you should indeed parse it as \"half of the [collection of] chessboard**s** were black\". Also note that utilising the context in these cases is actually *correcting* the error in the communicator.\n\nIn OPs case there is no strong prior to make you think that the sentence is actually in error so a reasonable person (and I bet the rest of the class) parsed the sentence in the correct (or at least \"less incorrect\") way.
