The other baby's heart stopped, they called for an ambulance, but it took an hour to get to a hospital that could handle her. That baby is showing signs of developmental delay. \n\nUnfortunately, many mothers that I know that choose home births are also very religious. They also don't believe in regular prenatal care.
