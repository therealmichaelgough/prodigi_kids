But I honestly don\u2019t know what to do anymore! \n\nI\u2019ll put the TLDR up here for those of you who don\u2019t want to read the entire thing. Quite understandable. If you stick through it all...THANK YOU in advance. \n\nTLDR: MIL has done many questionable things with almost 10month old baby since she was born. Has made me greatly concerned to leave baby alone with her due to safety reasons, but keeps insisting on babysitting. Due to these \u201cquestionable\u201d things, our relationship as MIL and DIL is being strained. \n\nHere it goes...\n\nSo we were initially pumped to have both sets of grandparents fairly close and we thought we were set on babysitters. However, that has most definitely not been the case. My mom is the type of person who is WAY OVER THE TOP protective and paranoid. Sometimes to the point where I\u2019m like \u201cok, mom, baby is ok. The car seat in the other room on the table isn\u2019t going to fall on her\u201d lol But, it attributes to why I am so beyond comfortable leaving the baby with her and, since that\u2019s how I was raised, I\u2019m definitely a little like my mom when it comes to safety. \n\nNow, my MIL ...not so much. All boys have had broken bones, one child ran away with dog when he was like 3 and was lost for a couple of hours, one ended up under a car somehow, another fell down the stairs in his walker...just crazy stuff that I could never imagine happening to me and my siblings. \n\nWhen it comes to our baby, I\u2019m just going to list instances off as best as I can remember them starting from when we first started noticing things.\n\nI had an emergency c section, so when baby was first born, MIL came to stay with us for a week to help with pets, stuff around the house and the baby, of course, while I recovered and got adjusted. \n\nShe would come in to relieve me of the baby so so I could rest, but then I would see her walking around without baby. She would leave the baby on the changing table unattended or downstairs unattended while our two dogs and cat were just roaming around. Now, our pets are amazing, but this would have been the first time around a newborn and I am a STRONG believer of never leaving a small child unattended with animals. Especially a newborn. \n\nMIL later suggested to leave baby on boppy pillow on kitchen table while I got stuff done once I was recovered. She was doing so while I was resting upstairs and she was watching baby. We have a super industrial dining room table on top of hard wood floors. I know newborns are vegetables when so little, but why ontop of a table? \n\nWhen the baby would cry, she would hold baby up to her face and SCREAM in baby\u2019s face. Or baby would be crying in car seat, would get up to baby\u2019s face and scream! She still does this, has never really stopped. \n\nWhen the baby was practicing sitting, so still super duper wobbly, she would leave baby unattended on hard wood floors. Would literally just walk away without a word like \u201chey will someone watch baby?\u201d Just get up, walk away, leave baby alone. \n\nWhen the baby started crawling, MIL would put her straight onto hardwood instead of on rugs. Said it\u2019s okay if baby face plants because she \u201cdoesn\u2019t have teeth yet.\u201d \n\nOne time, she was on the floor with baby and baby was learning to crawl. The baby\u2019s leg got stuck under her and instead of moving it to help her keep moving, she \u201cpushed\u201d baby\u2019s butt and she face planted HARD onto hard wood floor, causing first bump and first bruise. Blamed baby being unsturdy for the fall. \n\nHusband played with baby where he would sit directly in front of couch on floor and baby would sit on edge of couch and wiggle herself into husbands arms. MIL wanted to try and completely did not catch baby. I was sitting next to baby and happened to catch her arm so she didn\u2019t hit floor so hard. But what if I hadn\u2019t been there?\n\nGave baby water balloon and baby didn\u2019t like when it popped and got her wet. So, she went to get another water balloon and the same thing happened. Crying baby. So, her solution is to go get a THIRD water balloon. This was all right before baby was supposed to have her 6 month photo shoot. I had brought her outside for this reason only. Oh and while I\u2019m drying and changing baby into another outfit (thankfully I had a back up picture outfit) she comes over to shoot water on baby from already broken water balloon! Baby is hysterical. \n\nGave baby metal spoon. Baby proceeds to jam it up her throat and gags on it. Then baby throws it. So, the next thing MIL grabs is a KNIFE, shows it to baby and says \u201clike this!\u201d And starts banging it on the table then almost gives it to her!!!! Husband intervened. \n\nGave baby ceramic decor to play with. Baby proceeded to slam it on table. I said \u201chey, MIL, I would hate for that to break\u201d and her response was \u201coh I don\u2019t care. I\u2019ve had that for 15 years!\u201d  I\u2019m not worried about your stupid ceramic rabbit. I\u2019m worried about it breaking and cutting my child. Next time we were over, gave baby another ceramic piece of decor! I had to come over and take that away as well after husband said \u201cit can break and cut her\u201d \n\nSince baby started eating table food, just tries to shovel everything in baby\u2019s mouth, even when baby still has obvious food in her mouth. Literally shovels food in there to stuff her mouth to point where baby is trying to move face away to avoid food being put in mouth\n\nRecently, she was trying to get baby out of high chair without removing tray. Baby is crying because legs are stuck under tray. Instead of removing tray, she continues to try and take baby out! \n\nThe baby was crawling around in loft area, headed straight for stairs. MIL is on the floor, supposed to be playing with/watching  baby...is so checked out talking that she doesn\u2019t even notice.\n\nThese are just a FEW things that stick out atm. Keep in mind my child is almost 10 months old and we hang out with them an average of once a week since baby has been born. Something has happened about 85% of the times we have seen her. Not all of these are safety issues, I\u2019m aware. I think the balloon thing and the screaming are\nmore about my child being comfortable and not annoyed or flustered. \n\nNow, I am okay with things like screen time, for example. We don\u2019t ever do it at our house. MIL loves showing baby her phone. If grandma wants to do that every now and then, so be it. Grandma\u2019s are allowed to do that. Same with giving foods we may not feed or approve of on a regular basis, like cupcakes and Cheetos. The \u201cspoiling\u201d part is what grandmas do.  \n\nI even give her a pass when it comes to pushing things, such as giving my baby a pacifier when she was a newborn. As a brand new mom, I didn\u2019t want to give her a pacifier until we had breastfeeding down, due to nipple confusion. That was my choice. My MIL insisted NON STOP and still does. Even complained to my husband in the beginning because she wanted to be able to comfort baby like I was able to. At this point, baby just never took a pacifier and she is completely fine. \n\nThere\u2019s other things that she tries to push for that we just don\u2019t want to do as parents. However, my point is that things like this aren\u2019t enough to influence the baby because she isn\u2019t raising the baby and they\u2019re not really my issues with her. But, all the safety stuff is what concerns us. \n\nIt\u2019s so bad, that my husband and his brothers have even thought that there is something deeper going on with their mom. Like something health-related. They reached out to his dad about it, but he said everything is fine and that was the end of that. \n\n At this point I would never ever leave my child with her. Even for an hour. And she KEEPS INSISTING and it\u2019s just getting to the point where I ignore her because I do not know what to say. \n\nWe don\u2019t even trust ourselves to go over there alone with baby, as in just my husband and baby to go see grandparents while I get a break or something. We have to double team her as husband and wife to keep an eye on her. It\u2019s like watching an over-excited toddler with a baby, so we\u2019re basically babysitting her and the baby when we go there.\n\n It\u2019s so stressful and we live close, so it\u2019s not like we can avoid it. I am guilty of purposely trying to fill our weekends with plans so we don\u2019t have availability to see her. My husband feels the same on everything except avoiding going over there at least once a week. I totally understand his side, though. She is her grandmother and I cannot keep her from seeing her granddaughter. She has every right to see her and spend time with her. \n\nHowever, I used to enjoy spending time with his family, but she has made it so absolutely stressful and unpleasant, that I am starting to resent her. I am starting to nitpick, for sure. I have caught myself doing it. I can\u2019t help it. I have snapped on her a couple of times now when it comes to baby and it is just so unlike me. I feel like I\u2019m getting close to hitting a breaking point. \n\nWhat do we do, guys?! I\u2019ve suggested to my husband talking to her when I\u2019m not around. But he makes a good point. She is so ridiculously stubborn that she will deny everything and then is the type of person to do certain things just because she\u2019s being told no or otherwise. Not very receptive at all. I don\u2019t want to keep baby from her, but things are getting so awkward with her begging and pushing to babysit.  My husband used to just blame it on me and say that I was super paranoid and just didn\u2019t let anyone watch the baby. It was an essay excuse for the time being. However, you can only keep that lie going for so long. At this point she is aware that my mom watches the baby when we need a sitter. To top it all off, all of this is putting a huuuuge strain on our DIL-MIL relationship. \n\nSo, AITA for not letting my MIL babysit?\n\nIf you made it this far, thank you x infinity! I know it was super duper long, but I needed to rant and get it off my chest. I need clarity from different viewpoints. First time moms, moms with multiples, grandmas...everything! \n\nAre we being crazy first time parents? Are justified? Advice?
