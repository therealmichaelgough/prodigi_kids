Maybe I'm ignorant, but I didn't think it was as normal to be diagnosed with PPD  so late. My son is now 12 weeks old, 10 weeks adjusted, and he literally has never smiled for me. He's always all smiles for his grandma. This morning, after he woke up, I was playing for him and he was crying and pouting. The moment he went to his grandma, he started smiling and vocalizing. My MIL (his grandma) doesn't speak a lot of English, so she doesn't understand when I tell her I want my baby to play with him during the day.  She literally has him all day and gives him to me during the night and for feedings. I have tried to tell her that I want my baby, and I'll get him for 10 minutes and she will ask for him back. It's been so tough to the point where I'm in tears several times a day. I've brought it up with my husband, and he tries to reassure me that our son is still a baby and doesn't know how to express himself. He doesn't think I need to speak to someone because I'm overreacting. I don't know what to do. I feel like I don't even have my baby on my side. I can't talk to someone, because when I bring it up to my husband, he says that he doesn't think I need to. I've thought about talking to someone behind his back, but he will see the insurance claim. I can't afford to pay for someone on my own since all of our money is in a joint account. I feel like my hands are tied. Will it get better? What do I do? What am I doing wrong? I need help.

Definitely not too late to get diagnosed with PPD. I had really bad prenatal anxiety and depression and I won\u2019t be surprised if I end up having it again now that I have a newborn. \n\nMy MIL stayed with us for a week during my son\u2019s 2nd week of life. The first half of the week, she helped with cleaning and always wanted to hold baby. But she refused to listen to me about his feeding cues. She kept insisting that her and my partner could soothe him (better than I could) but his feeding cues were consistent and persistent. I desperately want to breastfeed and ignoring his cues messes with my ability to produce. And it pissed me off and made me feel like a bad mom when she would race me to his crib to grab him when he cried. Like dude, I\u2019m the first person who needs to touch him. I don\u2019t need someone else trying to do my job. I finally broke down sobbing in front of her &amp; my partner and the next day she was MUCH more receptive of the baby\u2019s needs and mine after that. \n\nI definitely had to put my foot down but it\u2019s hard when someone is staying in your home and I hate confrontation. And she just really wanted to be helpful. I literally explained the process of soothing him at least twice daily. Finally after my breakdown, she understood. I told her any movements and sounds are to be answered with feeding first, then we go down the line of changing and tummy pain if feeding doesn\u2019t calm him. She just couldn\u2019t comprehend initially that he needed to feed every 30 minutes to 3 hours. \n\nI hope you realize your feelings are real and valid. I\u2019m sorry your husband isn\u2019t as receptive but sometimes people get weirdly defensive when you express health concerns. And people are weird about mental health in general.

I know you wrote that you\u2019re not interested in medication, but I would encourage you to be a bit open-minded about it. I didn\u2019t want to take anything, but I have, with the goal of getting to where I don\u2019t need it anymore. For me, it hasn\u2019t \u201cfixed\u201d me, but it took the edge off to the point where I wasn\u2019t crying or angry and could function better.\n\nYou may not need medication or therapy once your MIL leaves and you\u2019re able to better bond with your baby. Her constant presence has interfered with that. She may have been a help to you, and she may mean well, but taking your baby from you so often has not been good for you or your baby. To be frank, it seems like your baby has bonded to her and may have a hard time adjusting when she leaves in January (glanced at your other posts).\n\nYou\u2019re both going to be fine after she leaves, of course, and your baby\u2019s focus will shift to you, though it may take a while. That doesn\u2019t mean you should just suffer through until she leaves. You mentioned she doesn\u2019t speak English well. I\u2019ll bet she understands \u201cno\u201d though. And as a mother herself, I guarantee she knows that you want to hold your baby. She\u2019s just putting her desires above yours. So when she tries to take your baby back after you\u2019ve only been holding him for 10 minutes, you smile and say \u201cno thank you,\u201d and turn away. Or learn a few phrases in her language to let her know you\u2019ll hand him back if/when you need her help.\n\nIt really bothers me that your husband is so dismissive of your feelings. Based on what you\u2019ve written, you are NOT overreacting. Your feelings are valid and he, nor anyone else, gets to tell you how you should feel. And unless he is a mental health professional or OBGYN, he lacks the expertise to say that you don\u2019t need to talk to someone. If you have sufficient funds in a joint account, don\u2019t go behind his back, but don\u2019t ask him if you can go to a therapist. Just do it. If you\u2019re afraid of his response, then you may have other relationship issues that could also be addressed in therapy.\n\nHave you ever visited r/justnomil? You might cross post over there to see what kind of responses you get. They may have good insights and suggestions for how to set boundaries with your MIL.\n\nI\u2019m glad you\u2019ve reached out to your OB for help.
