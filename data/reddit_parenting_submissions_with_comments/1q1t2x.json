We co-slept for the first couple of months, but our bed was small so I hacked an ikea changing table into a co-sleeper that worked for her until she could worm out of it. That's when we transitioned her to a crib. A lot of people swear by a pack n play for travel, but you could probably make it do double duty for the first year as baby's bed both at home and away. Many of them come with a changing table attachment too so in that way, it does triple the work. Alternatively, you could find a 3 in 1 crib. Ikea has a great affordable one that has two crib heights, then when baby is ready to transition, you take off one side, then at the next stage another and it serves as a toddler bed which can last them nicely 'til about 4 or 5 years old. \n\nYou can live without the changing table, just use a bath towel under baby and change on the couch or bed. Figure out a way to set up everything you need for changing diapers to keep it close to where you make the baby changing area. I did find it easiest if one place was where we always did it, that way no looking around for where the supplies were last used. I'll be honest, a diaper pail is a nice to have if you can figure out the space. Those things stink to high heaven and you will not want to be running your trash out after every couple of changes. \n\nAs for a stroller, very few strollers can be used for an infancy without a car seat until about 4 months when baby can support their own head. So many strollers are big and bulky it might be worth considering getting a car seat that works with a snap n go stroller frame. The frames are super compact when folded (the car seat has to come out when folded) they have good storage underneath and you can sell it after 4-6 months when baby can move to a regular stroller. Then purchase a higher-end umbrella stroller that folds up as compactly as possible. You'll learn a lot over that time period to know what type of stroller handling is important to you. I swear, we ended up with 5 different strollers for #1 partly because we were in a nanny share but also because we bought one and hated its handling. So the cheap snap n go is a great way to save money and space while figuring out what you really need. \n\nYou will probably want a bouncer of some sort, not any of the major contraptions, just something on a simple sort of stand that vibrates and has a little bit of visual stimulation. It does take a bit of room in the place, but you can find a way to store it when not in use I'm sure. This is great for getting baby out of the car seat into something that won't flatten their head, soothes them for napping, visual stimulation and very importantly, keeps them safe and entertained when you want to take a bath. You can also use it as an initial highchair when first starting food. I'm talking about something like this http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp?productId=19346836&amp;cp=2255957.2273443.2255983.2256084&amp;parentPage=family\n\nYou also should consider a play mat or gym for tummy time. Some are super excessive, some super simple. Some of them are made to pick up and store relatively easy as well. This is good for development and stimulation as well.\n\nA baby carrier in addition to a stroller is a good idea too, if you have a place you can try different ones out that would be ideal. I don't know that I'd go only with a carrier.

I mean, I try imagining myself sitting like that for hours and... no thanks. My back would hurt, my crotch would hurt, it just generally seems so damn uncomfortable. Plus, while no specific cases have been documented, there MAY be some risk to families that have a history of hip displasia (like mine), but not for the general public. If you pick up a baby, it's natural instincts are to curve around you in a seated position, not just hang there like in Bjorn - it seems like a no-brainer to me to go with a carrier that mimics the way a baby natural positions itself against you.\n\nThere's also the over stimulation factor... which is not something I really put much stock in until my nephew came around. He has some issues due to drugs his birth mother took during pregnancy and if there's too much going on around him, he can get really agitated. My brother and sister in law tried wearing him facing out so he could see things and he hated it after about five minutes, but whenever I babysat I'd put him in a carrier facing in on my back and he'd happily stay in there for hours while I did other things - he could still look around and see, but whenever things got to be too much he could snuggle in and block things out.\n\nAlso, while I know everyone is different, it seems like many, many more people complain about how uncomfortable Bjorns (and other carries with similar strap configurations) are for the wearer. Many people seem to complain of back pain since all the weight of the baby is put on the upper back, unlike with certain other carriers that distribute weight across the entire back and onto the hips.\n\nI really like my Ergo, but the only reason I have it is because it was on a major sale (down to $70 from the usual $140).

You'll definitely get the hang of breastfeeding, but you can't predict what crazy path you'll need to take to get there!\n\nA swing or little vibrating chair is really good, too. Sometimes you need to have free hands or even just take a shower. Having a safe and comforting place to put baby is a godsend. \n\n\n\n", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1383880710, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": 1383881222, "gilded": 0, "id": "cd9dgiw", "link_id": "t3_1q1t2x", "parent_id": "t3_1q1t2x", "retrieved_on": 1428746550, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"archived": true, "author": "snowellechan77", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "To add to the anti-bjorn posts, all the weight is on your shoulders.

It'll be awhile before you can bathe the baby in a normal tub, and while you *could* do it in the bathroom sink, the baby would probably either be too small for the sink alone as a newborn or outgrow the sink before being big enough for the regular tub. Unless you're super-neat people I wouldn't recommend relying on the kitchen sink to bathe a baby, because it will probably have dirty dishes in it :P They make ones that fold up - we're also short on space and for baby gear in general I've found that searching for the travel versions of things helps.\n\nYou'll also want somewhere you can safely put the baby down.  When they're very young, it helps for this to be a swing, bouncy seat, or playgym, so they have toys to look at/bat at.  A blanket on the floor is fine for tummy time (don't just put them on the carpet.  You can't throw the carpet in the laundry when the kid spits up.) but if you have non-carpeted floors get a rug grip so it won't slide around when they move.  \n\nI know a lot of other posters are recommending just getting a carrier, but I would recommend at least researching strollers so you have one picked out in case you need it.  I had a big baby and a rough recovery, so it was a month or so before I'd recovered enough to use a carrier comfortably - and my son cried in them until he could hold his head up, because the newborn head support blocked his view of the world.  Plus there are some situations when you need somewhere to put the baby down.  If you don't have friends/family who could come with you to hold the baby when you have a doctor's appointment, you'll want a stroller.  Exam rooms don't come with baby seats.  This is definitely the sort of thing that depends a lot on your lifestyle, your health, and your baby's temperament, so do the research at least.  \n\nI'd highly recommend that you check out some local boutique-type baby stores.  You don't need to buy from there if they're overpriced, but they're a great place to try out products for yourself.  Things like carriers it's really best to try first (our local store had a sandbag so you could try it with weight).\n\nBibs.  Nail scissors.
