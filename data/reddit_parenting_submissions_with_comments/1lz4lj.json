For two solid hours, I managed to drape him over my thigh and stroke his back intermittently while breast feeding Baby B. But Baby B was still hungry so I let them both scream while I prepared a bottle. At that point baby A was hysterical, so I had a choice, let Baby A freak out so I could snuggle/feed Baby B, or calm down Baby A and let Baby B starve. I decided to calm down Baby A and prop a bottle up for baby B and omg, they both lived.
