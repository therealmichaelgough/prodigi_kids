Condoms reduce HIV and other  STDs transmission.\n\nMale circumsion is not good at all. It damages nerves and reduces sensations. The foreskin has a lot of uses, it protects the glans and its movement during sex does not dry out a woman's vagina as badly. Less lube is needed. The man is a more gentle lover because he can get pleasure from the movement of the foreskin.\n\n\nRemoving the foreskin causes the glans to dry out and rub against the underwear. This causes it to become calloused and reduces sensitivity in the glans.\n\n\nCircumsion was made popular in the US for the reason of reducing masturbation. Please look up Kellogg. He also advocated putting acid on little girls clitorises for the same reason. That guy is sick.\n\n\nIn Africa, they went and circumsised many men \"to prevent the spread of AIDs\". Those men went and did not use condoms, because they had the surgery, and actually increased the rate of HIV transmission. Even if it did reduce transmission, condoms reduce it more and you don't have to mutilate a boys genitals to do it. \n\n\nInfant boys are circumsised with either no anesthetic or just given sugar water. The doctors say they can't feel the pain, which is ridiculous, you should watch a video of them doing it with the volume turned up and listen to the screams. It is heart-rending.\n\n\nCircumsion on an infant who is unable to consent to permeant damage to his genitals without a medical reason is mutilation and should be illegal. After all, circumsion on a female child is illegal, and people who do it are using the exact same excuses we are using to mutilate little boys. It is wrong. If an adult decides he wants to do it, this is very different than doing it to an infant.\n\n\nOne source, I am on my mobile, I can overwhelm you with sources when I get home.
