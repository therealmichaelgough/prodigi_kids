This is my first post on this sub-reddit and I knew I came to the right place. You all are so encouraging and supportive. Thank you thank you thank you. \n\nThis is very long, I know. But I really need some advice and wanted to be as detailed as possible, so please if you have time can you read and give some advice?\n\nI feel like such a failure of a mother. I have spent my whole life knowing I wanted to be a mother. I grew up babysitting for all the neighbourhood kids. I nannied for a 2 year old at one point. I am a teacher (but I teach high school kids). I have always LOVED spending time with my nephews (there are SEVEN of them!!). I even took care of one of my nephews one day a week from the age of 6 months - 1.5 years. So I guess I expected that \"moming\" would be no problem for me. \n\nWell here I am, 6 months in, and feeling like I am just not cut out for this. My babe has been a tough one from the get-go. He was never a good sleeper (though that is FINALLY improving) and he has always been on the \"fussy\" end of the spectrum. From 0-3 months he slept so much during the day that it wasn't too hard to entertain him when he was awake, but he did require me to constantly bounce him, walk around with him, etc when he was awake. I could not put him down on/in anything, and I also couldn't just sit down and hold him. He has never been a cuddly baby, and never simply wanted to be held or snuggled or rocked. No, he had to be held face out, and walked around the house and bounced. But as I said, the amount of \"wake time\" was minimal so I was only ever doing this for an hour at a time here and there throughout the day. I also chalked it up to being in the fourth trimester and told myself that things would get better. \n\nCut to now: he is 6 months old and things are not better! His wake time between naps is about 2 hours (3 hours before bed) and I am finding it SO hard to parent him during these times. He is only ever happy if I take him for a walk, or take a bath with him. When I do either of those two things he is TOTALLY chill/happy/content. \n\nHere is what a typical 2 hour wake time looks like for us (not including breast feeding, which happens somewhere in there as well): Lay him down on our big foam mat, on his back, and play with him. He will roll around a bit, and play a bit, but he will begin to fuss after 5-10 mins and then slowly escalate to full on crying. Then I try to pull him into my lap. He squirms and thrusts his hips and continues to cry. I try singing to him again. He still cries. I sit him up and give him a toy. He still cries. I give him a teether. He bites it once and then cries more. I try giving him a snack. He cries. Eventually I take him outside and we go for a walk (and then he is perfectly happy and content). It doesn't matter what \"activity\" I start with, it always starts out okay for a few mins and then shortly after he is crying. If I am proactive I might be able to move him from one activity to another before he melts down, but this would literally involve me doing something new with him every five minutes, which is exhausting. \n\nI am at a complete loss as to what to do. I wind up in tears at the end of every day because I am so exhausted. Today I went on FIVE different walks with him (the upside is I'm actually BELOW my pre-prey weight!) and we spent 40 mins in the bath together. But this just doesn't seem sustainable to me. Plus I live in Canada and WINTER IS COMING. \n\nI don't recall any of my nephews being like this. I also can't hear anybody tell me \"'it's just a phase\" one more time, because he has NEVER been chill! So I guess my questions are....Is this normal behaviour for a 6 month old? How should I be responding? I know you \"can't spoil a newborn\" by picking them up/responding to their cries, but at what point does that stop being true? Am I doing something wrong? I don't understand why my baby seems to be so unhappy so often. I love him to pieces but I am also so resentful that I can't enjoy this stage of my child's life because it is SO hard. When I meet up with friends or my sisters, and their babies, I get SO jealous that they seem to just play on the floor contentedly, while I am doing everything in my power to distract mine and keep him from crying.

There were definitely some books he just didn't like though. Also, and I know this is controversial, the tv was a big help. He has never cared for cartoons, but there's this band called Walk Off The Earth that does a lot of cover videos on YouTube where the camera is on their faces as they sing (rather than just random music video stuff) and he loves watching those. Seriously, they calm him down like nothing else, and it was such a relief for me to have a bit of a break. If you're interested in giving this a try, the first videos of theirs that he was really into were the Hello cover with the surf board and tap dancers, and the Can't Feel My Face cover. \n\nAnyways, you have my sympathies, 6 months was a really hard age cause they want to be entertained but can't do it themselves.

When she became mobile, she would just follow me around the yard while I pulled weeds or sit happily in the jogging stroller when I took her running. Now that she can walk, we go outside and pick veggies from our garden, she pushed her wagon and other push toys, plays in the dirt and with the stones and has a ball.

I saw this and then I got busy and I forgot! \n\nSo for us it came down to two different things that he learned: that he can sleep by himself; and that sleeping is done at night, after his routine that NEVER changes.\n\nIn the beginning weeks and months of course baby will be sleeping in the bassinet next to the bed (ours moved into the crib in the guest room at 6 months, although he was good earlier it's just that I got a little nervous at 5 months and then waited another month lol). The first part of sleep training that we did was establish NOT sleeping in the bed. He always slept in his bassinet. I can admit that for about 2 weeks we did have him sleep in the bed with us, but he was a premie (just by 5 weeks) and we wanted our body heat to always keep him warm (even though he hated blankets like...kid aren't you suppose to be a little chilly in the winter lol)\n\nThe training was slow. So he of course as an infant would have regular sleep/wake cycles; but beginning  at 8 weeks, I started skipping his last nap of the day by keeping him awake and entertained during that nap time. I would change his clothes, breast feed, watch tv, sing, etc. his last nap was always from 9pm-10pm; but once he started skipping that nap, he went to bed at 12am and woke up at 6am. I don't work so I spent literally all day attending to his needs and his hunger (for anyone who wants to make any snarky comments to me). My son always continued to gain weight, that's how we knew it was ok. He gained weight and he was always happy.\n\nSo from that point on his sleep lengths became longer and longer. By 5 months, he was asleep from 12am - 10am. I decided that the next phase of sleep training would begin; choosing an earlier bed time. By this time he was in solids and breastmilk so he was defidently getting a lot more calories in. I started with 10pm. I put him down in his crib at 10pm with a bottle, and after his bottle he cried for maybe 10 minutes and was out cold. \n\nBy this point, i put him back in the bassinet a few more weeks because i just needed to be sure, and he continued to sleep through the night (btw, the bassinet had to be on husband's side because if he smelled me he would be fussy and not sleep).\n\nAt 6 months he was back in his bassinet. His routine was always a bottle in his crib and lights out. Sometimes he would fall asleep, sometimes he would fuss for a minute or 10 and fall asleep. After a few more weeks I added in a warm bath before bed, and also, he naturally started to show signals of wanting to go to bed for the night earlier; so it turned into 9pm, then settled on 8pm. So now at ~10 months he expects dinner by 730, a bath at 8pm, lotioning up and pajamas,then a bottle. He knocks right out and sleeps the night. Usually as far as naps, he naps from 12pm -130pm and again for about 45min -1hour starting around 4pm.\n\nNo matter what, always keep to your preferred routine. Sometimes he'll be very fussy and cranky because he's tired and once he's in the bath he calms right down because he knows exactly what's coming next, and he expects it. A little crying and fussing will not hurt the baby, and your baby will not question whether you or dad love it. Also I like to point out that sleeping all night helps his brain recover from the constant learning he does daily, since he's not just surviving from nap to nap.\n\nAlways check for things like weight gain and general demeanor, that's what always kept me going. Baby will spend more time awake and eating during the day, so be prepared for that. My son is no worse for the wear. He's happy, he's gaining, and he has no sleep issues or sleep anxiety. I believe that this is more than just training to sleep at night; it's about reducing night time anxiety levels and adding a sense of comfort and security. \n\nWe didn't do any of the rocking to sleep or any of that. I have nothing against rocking to sleep, but I feel that it always kept my son awake and alert (so I always rock him in the morning just to have some cuddles and sweetness) so YMMV but we always put him down to sleep when he knew he was satisfied in his hunger and clean in his diaper, and it was time to sleep. Now he just knocks right out when he's put down. Just remember that your baby will not think that you don't love him if he fusses for a few minutes (I'm assuming a he now lol).
