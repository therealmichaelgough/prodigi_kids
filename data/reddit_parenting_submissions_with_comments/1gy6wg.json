I have a 4 month-old and he's my first. I tell myself he is going to be a perfect angel, never act out, never beat up on other kids (yeah, I know I'm just dreaming). Anyway, it seems everywhere we go where there are other kids, some toddler or preschooler is harassing my little guy.\n\nHere's an example: We live in a community with a shared pool. We went to the pool today for the first time this season and no less than three kids, aged maybe 3 to 6, came up to me and the baby and started trying to dump water on him, splashing him, trying to grab him away from me -- all the while not a parent was to be seen. \n\nHere's my question...At what point is it OK to discipline another person's kid? One particularly naughty 4-year-old girl who kept repeatedly asking if she could dunk my baby (I kept saying \"No, you may not dunk the baby. It will make him cry and maybe hurt him.\") started getting all grabby and tried to grab my baby's face, then lifted a hard plastic toy over her head and was about to throw it at him. I gently moved her arm away and said \"No. Do not throw that at my baby.\"\n\nAlso, I need to mention that I was in the 1 foot deep baby pool.\n\nI worried some parent would come running over and start a fight with me because I dared touch her kid. This sort of thing happens pretty often and I really don't know how to handle it. Any suggestions? I was thinking of asking the lifeguards to help, but they watched the whole time and didn't seem to care.\n\nEdit: measured the pool, was 1, not 2 feet deep.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Dealing with strangers' misbehaving children?", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/1gy6wg/dealing_with_strangers_misbehaving_children/", "user_reports": []}, "comments": [{"archived": true, "author": "sugar_honey_ice_tea", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "When it comes to the well being of your child, it's ok to say something, especially if they was no parent around.
