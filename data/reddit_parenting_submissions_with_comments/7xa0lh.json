Some thoughts for preparation:\n\n- Introduce one bottle feeding a day pretty early on. We started at 1 week old (w/Philips Avent Natural bottles) and baby never questioned it. This has been a godsend as it has allowed dad to feed, grandparents to babysit briefly, and the flexibility for all of us to leave the house without worrying about where to nurse. \n- You will still need to pump during this daily bottle to make the next day\u2019s bottle. \n- Pumping is frustrating at first but stick with it and by 4 weeks old you should be able to get some small freezer stash going. Early morning is the best time to get some extra for the freezer. \n- What kind of pump do you have? Does it have a battery or will you need to plug it in? Will it be easily portable?\n- A baby carrier will be perfect for this event but you might want to have a few options on hand and make sure to practice before the big event so baby is used to it. We have both a KTan and an Ergo and baby is still skeptical of KTan but was totally happy in the Ergo for up to 4 hours at 4 weeks. \n- Think about how car seat will work if you handoff to grandparents - and practice! Can you do baseless seatbelt install or should you buy grandparents their own base? \n- Do some reading on alcohol and breastmilk and figure out what you feel comfortable with ahead of time so you can enjoy yourself worry free!", "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "created_utc": 1518548057, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "du6yur6", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7xa0lh", "parent_id": "t3_7xa0lh", "permalink": "/r/Mommit/comments/7xa0lh/4_week_old_at_a_wedding/du6yur6/", "retrieved_on": 1518548067, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"approved_at_utc": null, "author": "Eliz824", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "banned_at_utc": null, "body": "To piggy back off the patterned dress idea: think about how you are gonna get those boobs out for feeding sessions.

I get immediate family members, but randoms at a wedding are not going to understand that you should not touch a baby if you feel even remotely off. Also, they should be washing their hands before they touch your baby, so bring a ton of hand sanitizer.
