They came in handy for my husband and my Doula - but I wasn't interested at all.\n- Buy some cheapo pillows (And I got waterproof pillow covers) from Walmart, they may get bloody, dirty, or left behind somewhere and you don't want to mourn them.  Same if you feel the need to bring a blanket. \n- I also recommend hair care. Bring Elastics, a brush, and a small bottle of your own shampoo and conditioner - the hospitals typically provide an all in one that is barely any match for the birds nest that was my hair after laboring. \n- Laptop's a good idea.  Mainly for post-birth communication/activities. \n- Deodorant also a good idea.\n- I brought two night gowns for use in the hospital that allowed for decently easy breastfeeding.  Bought them cheap at Target so that again, I wouldn't care if I stained them by accident from the after-birth flow.  Turned out to be an extra-quality idea because I had an emergency c-section after fetal distress/meconium/20 minutes of pushing and the nightgowns were particularly easy on my incision (as opposed to pants). \n- A going home outfit.  I ended up having my Mom pick up a maxi dress from my closet so that I could wear it home without irritating my incision, but I originally brought a comfy shirt and yoga pants. \n- TENNIS BALLS.  TENNIS BALLS. TENNIS BALLS.  They were KEY during labor.  My baby was faced the wrongish way, so I had bad back labor and COULD NOT GET ENOUGH of being rubbed on my back with the tennis balls.  \n- Camera \n- If you're going in with a partner who will be with you the whole time - pack THEM a change of clothes too. Just in case. \n- Other random toiletries. Tooth brush. Body wash. \n- Moisturizer - for back/body massaging during labor. My doula recommended Eucerin because it doesn't pill up and remains pretty good lubrication for constant rubbing. \n- Everybody is saying socks. That's true. But I also packed a cheap set of slippers for post-birth use. It made me feel extra put together to be walking around in almost real shoes. \n- Shower flip flops.  Showering in public/hospital/college showers squicks me out without wearing something on my feet, so the 2 dollar old navy flip flops were my buddy there. \n\n    I also brought a book and sudoku.
