It's a private Montessori school, and we're not in the states. Well the school chose as a subject a \"Homage to Cri Cri\", a kids songwriter from about 50 years ago. His songs are not something that I play for my kids, because a lot of them are racist, and the rest are just dumb. \nOut of six or seven musical numbers, the school chose three racist ones! Lyrics included: \"little black boy, go wash your face in the ocean, maybe it will lighten up,  and you'll be white enough\" , and \"little watermelon black boy, stop saying such dirty things, I'm going to tell your aunt, and she'll beat you and I will laugh\".... \nCostumes included kids with watermelons on their heads. And then a little girl in blackface came out! I almost died from shock. I took some pics, video, and posted to my Facebook, along with a not happy commentary on the state of racism in our country. \nSince then I have gotten hateful phonecalls, text messages, whatsapp messages, calling me crazy, basically, and saying that I'm \"using pics of the kids and putting them in danger for my own neurotic agenda\". \nHelp?

The fact that it happened and no one cared except you suggests that you live in a fairly \"racist\" area. There was pretty much nothing to gain by going to Facebook. Racists don't like to be called racist, and it really seems you are outnumbered by racists.\n\n3. Ultimately, no one was hurt. Frankly I think \"blackface\" is the least of the issues here, the songs and overall tone of things was far worse. I would have let it drop, looked for another school, and on leaving (not before, to protect my child) written a letter of disgust to the school and copied it to the central/national Montessori authority who I'm sure wouldn't condone this kind of thing under their brand.
