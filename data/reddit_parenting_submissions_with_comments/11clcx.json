I am more than likely the age of your mothers. \n\nTonight my 23 year old (who still lives with me because my house is huge and I would get lonely), comes home from work. I had made salmon loaf and a salad for dinner and it was ready when he came in the house. He isn't hungry. \n\nThen he says he is meeting a friend at a local market, so he leaves. Then the calls begin. He wants me to make him a corned beef and cabbage. But he doesn't want just any corned beef, he wants it from scratch. And he imagines that I can make this in the pressure cooker. \n\nCorned beef from scratch takes a week, just to brine the meat. Sadly, he knows I can make it. I don't have part of the brining ingredients on hand. He begins to call and text, asking what I need, then he gets irritated and won't answer the phone when I call him back. \n\nHe comes home from the market with $30 worth of USDA choice brisket, one head of cabbage and a bag of red potatoes. That's all. He flings the brisket on the kitchen counter and says \"do what you want with it.\" \n\nSo, I brown the brisket, cut up an onion, mince 3 cloves of garlic, and throw that in the pressure cooker with water and a package of Lipton Onion Soup mix. I cut up some potatoes for mash and set them on the stove with some water. I can hear the pressure cooker down there making its hissing noises right now. He is not going to get any food until about 10 PM, because he came back at 7:45. \n\nI am not complaining! \n\nBecause as someone that is on the other end of where you all with babies are... I love the holy living hell out of my kids. I see what all the hard work has produced. I see the kids that work hard, have gone to school, and act like sensible adult human beings. I see the kids that  they laid on my stomach after labor, that I watched take their first steps, learn new things every day, the kids that I taught to read and  forced to practice their instruments. And I finally see what all that hard work is for. \n\nI have seen them pull away gradually on their way to adulthood and it was painful at times, watching them make stupid mistakes. Bringing down the hammer on discipline. Letting them take responsibility for their actions. I have watched them become individuals. They surely didn't turn out like I expected in any way and honestly, I never tried to force them to. \n\nBut sometimes, a kid of mine wants dinner. Another kid will call me and ask me how I made that incredible pot roast or chicken. One of them will call and ask how to get out a stain from a work shirt. And I know that until my last breath, that I am always going to be there for them not only when they need me, but when they want me. \n\nBeing a parent is a 24/7, full time career. And sometimes when you are in the thick of it, you feel like you want to scream. Some days they will drive you nuts and some days they will make you so happy you want to cry. It's a kind of love that you don't know until you have it, *that* you have it. \n\nSo the next time you are walking the floor with a colicky baby, or wiping the spit up off that dress that has to be dry cleaned, that every moment with those selfish little beasts is precious. That some day you will watch your kid get a diploma. \n\nIt's over in an instant, *I swear it.* You will be so busy you won't even notice the passage of time. But every story you read to them, every dinner you made, every t-shirt you washed will become part of them, and they will still look to you for support and comfort. You won't be forgotten. So do your best, every day! \n\n\n\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Just so you don't think when your child is 18, that you are done with being a mom...", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/11clcx/just_so_you_dont_think_when_your_child_is_18_that/", "user_reports": []}, "comments": [{"archived": true, "author": "String_Shooter", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "I'm 24 and I *still* rely on my mom for all kinds of things.

I got pregnant while my dad was recovering (my first son was born 1 year and 11 days after my first anniversary). \n\nI was a latchkey kid. My parents both worked from the time I was 8. My mom couldn't really cook anything.

They were hypercritical and very negative with me. \n\nThe moment that my first child was laid on my stomach and I looked in his clear grey eyes, I knew that my child's life were going to be different than mine was. I was going to be that mom that was nurturing. I was going to read them stories and bake them cookies. I was not going to beat them literally or beat them down emotionally. \n\nI had to change. I had to forgive my own parents. I had to figure out who I was. I had to become altruistic and learn not to be selfish. I had to figure out how to love everyone and not only my children in a totally different way. I had to take a hard look at myself and realize that I needed to wipe that slate clean, because you can't change or control things that happened to you in the past, but you can control how you respond to it and make choices about what is going to happen in the future. \n\nAs for your one child theory... I hated being essentially an only child. I was alternately either being spoiled rotten, beaten or neglected. I felt very alone. I love my older brother, but I was never close to him and I don't speak to him because his wife is a Christian fundamentalist terror and he is completely pussy whipped. \n\nI was lucky. As an adoptee, my birth mother and I found each other. Now, I have siblings! The parents that raised me are both dead now, but I have a family that loves and accepts me. My friends have always been fiercely loved and like a family to me. \n\nWhile I think my oldest wishes he was an only child, my kids are close with each other. It makes me feel better to know when I am gone, that they will have each other.
