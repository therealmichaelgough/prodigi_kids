Breast feeding. I know I know, I've read how beneficial it is, and no pumping isn't an option for me either. That being said, please don't judge too much, although I welcome well placed ADVICE, I'm trying to get information from mom's who've bottle/formula fed from the start. How do you approach that with doc? How to start and deal with it at the hospital? What formula is the best to start with? I really want to know from some women who've been there if possible, or if you know someone who took this approach, but again any advice is welcome.\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Feeding Question, first time mom.", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/1prh3j/feeding_question_first_time_mom/", "user_reports": []}, "comments": [{"archived": true, "author": "twofivetwelve", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "It's nobody's business how you feed your child and why.

I will preface this with saying I am a supporter/advocate of breastfeeding,  but I realize that all circumstances are different, and we all want to do what is best for our family. It helps that you already know what you want. Do not feel that you have to explain your situation or decision to anyone. \n\nYou will constantly be given surveys by formula companies asking you if you are planning on formula feeding or bfing.... always put bfing because you will get more free cans of formula. I had multiple cases appear at my doorstep in hopes that I would give up and formula feed. I also got many coupons monthly. This will give you a variety of formulas to try if you have problems finding one that works. Then once you find one, see if there is someone you know that would be willing to swap containers for the ones that you don't use. \n\nIn the hospital they will probably give you something that most babies tolerate, such as similac advanced. I would just start with what your baby gets at the hospital and change it if you see any issues such as gas or allergies. I do not recommend stocking up on formula because if for some reason you can't use that particular brand, most stores will not allow unopened cans to be returned. I found that out the hard way.  \n\nAs for bringing it up with your doctor, there's really no need. Just ask how to ensure your milk either does not come in or is stopped as soon as possible. You will probably become engorged, and my best solutions is to put frozen cabbage leaves on your breasts when they feel full. It not only relieves the pain, but will inhibit milk production.

I had zero support, besides my husband. I pumped and supplemented what I had to for 6 weeks before going all formula. No one cared much then(5 years ago) and the hospital even pushed formula. \nSecond time, I wanted to breastfeed and I did, until we had a family emergency (my mom almost died) less than a month after having my son. I was overwhelmed,  depressed and felt like a failure. My baby needed to be supplemented and i didn't want to introduce bottles, so we would feed him by a syringe.  I developed ppd pretty bad. I stopped breastfeeding again at about 7 weeks. Ppd stuck around for what seemed like forever because I couldn't come to terms that I failed yet again. \nThird baby I already was in therapy and knew before I delivered he would be a formula baby, but there was still some guilt. I made the choice to breastfeed for the days while in the hospital and switch over when we got home. I seen a midwife this last time around and only one of the nurses was kinda a bitch about me switching and at my six week checkup they wanted to know why i wasnt breastfeeding. Every other nurse was really supportive when i stated that i knew breast was best, but its not for me. Even the his doctor didn't question why i was formula feeding. I knew if I tried and failed again it would be worse for me and what the baby needs was a happy mommy and formula feeding made me happy. \nAny future babies for husband and I will probably be breastfeed for the first few days and then switched over. \nMy kiddos are pretty darn healthy,  I can count on one hand how times the older two have been sick and needed antibiotics.  \n\nEveryone is different, no matter what you do someone will disagree with your choices.
