The first is: being in a a happy, unstressed, game for whatever state of mind can be really beneficial during childbirth.  No, it won't necessarily make it easy, fun, and riskless, but the reverse-- being uncomfortable, paranoid, distracted, and strung out-- can really foul things up.  So it makes sense to limit the people in the room to people you feel relaxed and safe around.  And it helps if those people all have a job to do so you don't have to feel like a host or a watched pot.\n\nBut, and maybe this is just my prejudice speaking, I think it is really good for fathers to see their kids being born.  I think many of them aren't quite going to get what you've gone through, how much work is involved, how extreme an experience it is, unless they get to be there.  I think it can be an intense bonding experience for them-- both with you, and with the baby.  And remember, if he's not there, he's not going to see that baby until its all cleaned up, dressed, and possibly sleeping.  The baby may not feel quite as much \"his\", at least not at first.  So you should think long and hard about what kind of experience you think he ought to have, what kind of experience you need him to have.  It might be enough to change your mind.  After all, you need the birth to work for you, but you need the postpartum period to work for you too.  What will make him the best ally?  Maybe ask about birth experiences over at r/daddit to see what they say?\n\nEdit:  I just reread this and I want to make sure I'm not giving the wrong impression.  I don't think his birth experience is more important than yours, but I do think a completely different set of important things can happen for dads in the delivery room, and it's in your family's best interest to look at the big picture.  Certainly there are situations where your comfort should override his right to be there.

It's more like dry heaves or straining to poop or something like that-- only for such a long period of time, and with such intensity, that it kind of crosses over into \"pain\".

Like going out into the battlefield, there is no room in his head for error. There is no room for failure. He needs to be positive and supportive and he needs to say to himself \"this will be a positive experience. This will be a life altering time for me.

You said that your hubby is dealing with PTSD from his combat experience.  First of all, thank you so much to him for going out there for his country and millions of people that don't even know his name.  \n\nSecondly, PTSD, regardless of where it comes from, can be an extremely difficult obstacle, and I really do respect you for being able to think of how he might feel in a situation where he isn't in control, and may be a trigger for him.  \n\nHowever, the birth of his child is a HUGE deal.  He is the ONLY person that can support you so intimately and help you bring your baby into your lives, and seeing you work through the process and face the pain (if you choose to experience the pain) may actually end up being somewhat therapeutic in a way.  Being such an important part of a process that is painful, yet so rewarding and positive may be helpful in shining a little light on life and pain that have been demonized in regards to his senses during his experiences in combat. \n\nMaybe finding a support group, class, or even a birth counselor would help you both prepare for labor and delivery.  Maybe being able to speak to another man who has struggled with PTSD but was able to witness and participate in the birth of their child would be able to address the fears that you both have concerning the event.\n\nWhatever it takes, I think it would be worth the effort to have him be there to help you and baby through the experience.
