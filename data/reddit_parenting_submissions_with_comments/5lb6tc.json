It caused me to have PPD that I'm still recovering from and I feel this will be my only baby. Hubby still struggles with it. He is getting better, so I can have a break occasionally. \n\nWhat helped for me:\nBaby wearing. I tried the sling but went with a big wrap ( my girl grew quick) and learnt to wrap safely so when she was very young she could lay and when she was older she would be sitting. She basically slept on me during the day for 3 months either being held or in the wrap. I had naps when she slept with me I used my breast feeding/ pregnancy pillow to prop myself up on the sofa so my girl was safe ( approved by my midwife) \nYou do nothing else apart from deal with the baby. If he can't cope then he can do everything else. Cooking, cleaning, nappy changes, shopping, taking baby for a walk, bottles etc. They gives you some mini breaks\nI had my mum stay with me for a few weeks just so I could have a break occasionally. \nTry different brands of gas drops. Some make the bubbles go small, some large so they pass. Each doctor will recommend something different. You just have to try them. In the end infracol works for us. \nTeetha granules. It's Chamomile. It helps with teething, tantrums and colic. If your baby is having a crying fit and nothing is calming then down try giving them this with the dummy. It's enough to break the cycle. \nTummy massages helped a lot. You can buy baby tummy balms or just use baby oil. It just helps the gas move. \nLeg movements when changing nappies. Think of it as an exercise video with your babies legs. Bicycle and pushing the knees into the tummy gently. Helps move the gas\nBottles- we got ones that have an outlet for extra air. ( we never tried colic ones) \n\nThat's all I can think of at the moment. I hope it helps in any way. It does get better. It is for a relativity short period of time, but it is an eternity until it gets better. Hang in there and talk to your hubby. He maybe suffering from PPD. But get him to do everything else.

Below are a few things that came to mind for you to check into if you haven't already.\n1. Lip tie/tongue tie is VERY often missed, even by drs. There is even a type that's hidden.  You can google around about it, but it causes improper latch and the baby not getting enough milk causing fussiness.  Do you have pain when you nurse?  Does she seem satisfied after eating? If she's not then there's a good chance the issue is food related.  Also, do you find yourself nursing her for very long periods of time?  My cousin had this with two of her kids, and the same day after they got their tongue tie clipped they were eating and happy. \n2. Is her poop frothy?  Does she seem gassy? You might have oversupply.  I had this issue, and all it took to fix was feeding her from the same side 2-3 times until my supply went down a bit. When you have oversupply the baby gets too much of the watery foremilk and not enough of the fatty hind milk.  This results in general crankiness and etc etc\n3.  If she has a dairy intolerance, often it's recommended to cut out soy as well. The baby can't digest the milk protein correctly, causing problems. But milk and soy have very similar protein structures. Also there are SO MANY hidden sources of milk and soy, there's lists online. I had this with my daughter (she even had streaks of blood in her poop!) and it took about 3 weeks for things to even out. I also did it realize a probiotic I was taking was not dairy free. You gotta check vitamins- EVERYTHING.\n4. It may be worth keeping a little log of when she starts crying and what happened before and after, you may see a pattern emerge.\n5. You may just have a sensitive baby, in that case stay as calm and positive as you can and hold her, do akin to skin, babywear. The closeness may comfort her.  Sometimes the issue can be some combination of the above.\n6. My 3rd lactation consultant was a miracle worker, if your insurance covers it, you may find support and real help from one.\n7.  Find something to join, isolation is only going to drive you deeper into helplessness.  You can look up a local chapter of La Leche League, it's a support group where breastfeeding moms get together, and I believe the leader has to go through some training.  Nobody is more interested in solutions more than other moms with babies!\n8.  As a Christian, believe me, we are happy to see new faces in church.  If I knew where you were I might be able to recommend one, but a Pastors wife should be pretty used to helping.  You don't have to be a member to get help!  A bigger church might have more resources (like a MOPS group) and has babysitting during services, but a smaller church might feel more personal.  Anyone you can reach out to, now is the time.\n9.  As for your husband, that's a tough one. If you feel unsafe, you and the baby should leave. If you feel ok, but he doesn't know how to handle his emotions, it's best to create some distance during stressful moments so you don't feed off each other's frustration.  There's a great book called Boundaries by Henry Cloud and John Townsend that will help you once you are able to read since right now it's probably hard.  You can't control his behavior, but you can control how much of it you expose yourself too.  Talk to his family, was he a colicky baby? Maybe him hearing that he was like that may help him understand it's all part of life. \n\nYou're fighting the good fight and you're doing your best, that means you're a great mom!
