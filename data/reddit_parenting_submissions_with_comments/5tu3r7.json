At 4.5 mo now, and it DOES get better.\n\nC-section here and my milk didn't come in until ~6 days after. My baby screamed a lot in he first couple days and it was because he was big (9lbs) and hungry! He had high bilirubin and we decided to give some formula. No matter what the Lactation ladies tell you, you CAN feed formula and then exclusively breast feed. Or feed both. The important thing is baby is FED. I was committed to breastfeeding so I tried to pump every time my SO fed a bottle, even when I was getting almost nothing and try to breast feed first for stimulation. It sounds like your baby is hungry and though your body WILL get there, these early days are so important to early development, I think it's much more important to make sure baby is fed and you are mentally healthy then drive yourself crazy\n\nThe first week was a blur and honestly, BF-ing was one of the most challenging things I've ever attempted. My sleep was poor and patchy but it got better as LO learned to feed and I learned how to help him latch. There were times, especially in the evening when he fed constantly. We both had a lot to learn! So I watched a lot of Netflix! When I was frustrated or tired, my SO would feed a bottle and that helped me rejuvenate and help me recommit for the next day.\n\nI want to also say, don't listen to your mom. They don't remember the beginning days, they just remember when their babies were feeding efficiently every 4 hours and their boobs were full of milk. My mom said the same thing and you know what, LOTS of women have the experience you and I have even if our mothers didn't. And that's ok! Just get baby fed, get yourself sleep and ENJOY your baby. It goes by so fast...\n\nIf you need support or have questions, feel free to dm me or visit r/breastfeeding.

I had my son October 18th he's now a few days shy of 4 months. Couple things. \n\n1: I got a C section too, had to because I had an infection.  My healing time was great though, and in the end was happy it happened.\n\n2: I think it was the infection that caused my low milk supply, and looking back I wasn't drinking a lot of water. Those first couple weeks felt like I was in the Twilight Zone.  He was huge at birth, 10 pounds 5 oz.  But he kept losing weight. I took fenugreek and blessed thistle was on Domperidon as well and nothing worked. I started supplementing a bit at a month and after awhile I couldn't handle his hunger and seeing him drop weight.  So at 6 weeks I went to all formula.\n\n3: I felt super guilty for a long time that I stopped breastfeeding.  I was obnoxious and was sure I would have no problems and I felt like less of a mother when I quit, but he started thriving and he now weights 19 pounds.  The fact of the matter is, if you get to that desperate point, you have to do what's best for you, because by helping yourself you are also helping your baby.\n\n4: Quick story, my grandmother lost her first baby in the 40s, she went full term and ended up getting toxemia. The baby died at birth when my grandmother went into a coma for a couple days. Sorry for such a horrible intro, but she had a cousin who had had a baby about a month or so before her. She thought the baby was just a fussy baby, but the baby ended up dying as well around the same time my grandmother's did. He died of starvation, at that time there was no help after you had the baby and people didn't know you could get low supplies. This is why they make Formula, not because if you supplement or solely feed formula you are a bad mother, but because babies would starve without it sometimes. \n\nFed is best, and so it your mental health.

And about the side feeding, I wouldn't worry too much if your unable to right now. My daughter is now 2&amp;1/2 months and she just started latching in that position (which makes it easier). It's hard right now but once you hit those 6 weeks you'll realize how special the bonding is between you and your baby. Also the fact that your giving him the healthiest form of food is a great feeling. I'm so thankful I stuck to it especially thinking how you don't have to worry about getting up to warm up a bottle in the middle of the night, you'll actually end up getting more sleep than bottle fed babies since you'll be able to just pop a boob out. Just close your eyes and take a deep breath and tell yourself this is tot the best and will get better, good luck!!
