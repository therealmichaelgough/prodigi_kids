Of course I was there the whole time... helping her push by giving words of encouragement and holding her hand and her leg. Or helping her count while bearing down. Then when the time came I was instructed to throw on some gloves, and get in there. And get in there is exactly what I did. I was the first person to physically touch my child other than my wife (who obviously had been \"touching\" him for months). I helped pull him out, and then immediately transferred him to her waiting chest so she could get some immediate skin to skin contact with him while all the cord blood was busy making its way into his body (so he didn't become anemic). For the love of all that is good in this world, do not let them sever the cord until it's finished letting all the blood be absorbed by your child. There are so many good things in that cord blood, and it needs to be in your child, not on the table.\n\nThe entire experience is going to be as worthwhile as you make it. If you are concerned about what you might feel afterward, you should probably watch a few birth videos, and get used to what's going to happen. I wish I could say \"It wont' change you at all,\" but no two people are alike. I have absolutely no problem with blood, etc. I had every intention of being a huge part of the birth from the beginning, so I was almost as eager as she was to meet our son, and to be there to touch him immediately as he was being born.\n\nAs a result of the experience, I've only gained a huge amount of respect for my wife, and what she's capable of.
