I wanted my body back and a semblance of my old life back, and suddenly I had to delay that by another two years. I felt selfish but it was the truth. \n\nNow my second daughter is almost 2. Husband had a vasectomy, so we\u2019re done. Honestly, I\u2019m glad I had them so close together now. I\u2019m an older mom (37 with a 4yo and 2yo), and recovery from anything physical gets harder the older I get. It\u2019s a good age gap, too.

When I look at photos of her as a newborn, I really miss the snuggles and closeness of that time. I even really enjoyes pregnancy.\n\nOn the other hand, I'm not sure I want to go through the sleepless nights and hormone roller coaster again.  I'm not as patient of a mom as I thought I would be. After work and my long commute, I don't have energy to play with her as much as I'd like.  I always thought I would be a great mom, but I'm not living up to my own expectations.\n\nI have some time to decide, because I wouldn't want to have another until my daughter is in kindergarten due to daycare costs.  I also think there is no \"wrong\" choice, just what works for your family. (And isn't that the hardest part about parenting.)\n\nGood luck to all of the other moms battling with this decision! Good luck (and congrats)to all of the pregnant moms too! :)\n\n", "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "created_utc": 1549843777, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "eg6toq7", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_ap52qk", "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_ap52qk", "permalink": "/r/Mommit/comments/ap52qk/why_am_i_so_afraid_to_have_a_second_child/eg6toq7/", "retrieved_on": 1549843778, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"approved_at_utc": null, "author": "Egwene-or-Hermione", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_279vpi41", "author_patreon_flair": false, "banned_at_utc": null, "body": "We wanted to have as small an age gap as possible so that they could be close friends.
