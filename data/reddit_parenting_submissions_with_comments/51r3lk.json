He is just... awesome! Anyway, about 2 weeks ago she was in for her 6-week checkup and was prescribed Jolivette (Norethindrone) birth control which was part of our plan. I'm not sure if it's coincidence but since then she's had trouble producing a steady supply of breastmilk for our lil guy. This has been really hard for her because she wanted to really go all-in since this is our last baby and since she doesn't have to work she can really dedicate herself to it. Not to mention money saved on formula! She keeps her fluids up and eats regular meals with a variety of foods. We also got some packets of this horrible smelling stuff that's supposed to increase milk supply. I don't think it's working.

Breastfeeding is all supply and demand, so any time your baby isn't nursing and getting nutrition elsewhere, that's signaling to her body that there's no need for her to produce to meet that feeding session. They'll go through many spurts at different ages where he'll need to nurse longer and more frequently to up her supply to meet his milk demand. It's normal, if exhausting.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that he may guzzle 4 oz of formula from a bottle because it flows easier and he doesn't have to work as hard to get it. They tend to easily overeat this way. Look up paced bottle feeding for breastfed babies if you do continue with bottles. Drawing out the feed and making them pause frequently will more easily let their tummies catch up and realize when they are full.\n\nBreastfed babies also eat much differently than formula fed babies. Around 2 months old, my daughter would eat maybe 3 oz every 2 hours or so. Breastmilk is digested in 90ish minutes, so they eat smaller amounts more frequently. It wasn't until my kid turned 5 months old that she started eating 4 oz at a time. She's 7 months old now and still only takes 4 oz at each feeding.
