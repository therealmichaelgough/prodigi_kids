If there is a big group and my child asks to go to the toilet you can guarantee another child will want to go to. Often the response from the other parent is \"you go, take my kid and I'll watch your baby\". This really isn't that weird a request but it makes me uncomfortable every time. \nI also hate anyone taking my daughter to the toilet so it could just be my problem.\nI have seen other parents who will quite happily let/expect a total stranger to escort their child into the bathroom. I think the attitude is that because that woman has children it's fine.

I was travelling, working overseas, partying, having a wonderful life.\n\nBy my thirties, several things changed.\n\n1.  Bars etc are full of 20-something.  You grow out of that lifestyle.\n\n2.  Travel is still brilliant.  But in your thirties you are often at a stage that you can probably buy a home/get a mortgage.  That does two things: the expense restricts your travel, and it gives you a new project to focus on.  I got really into gardening (on my little balcony) in my early thirties.\n\n3.  Your childhood gets further away, and you start to miss it, and want to do it over.  The twenties thrill of adulthood and freedom has become customary, and you start missing your earlier years.  Maybe a little rose-coloured, maybe not.  Having a child means you can pass on and relive a lot of that fun. \n\n4.  People start dying.  In my case my mother.  Bringing new life into the world is one way to - not to replace them - but to fill the gaps a little.  The only way you get your wonderful family christmases back with (now long dead) grandparents and uncles and aunts etc is by becoming parents, making your siblings aunts and uncles, and your parents grandparents.  It's about renewal.\n\n5.  Because of the house and mortgage, and the settling down with a permanent partner, things can get a little static/stale/a bit of a rut.  Having a child is a wonderful new project and experience that keeps your life really dynamic.  I realise that sounds kind of weird, to describe a child as a \"project\", but in many ways starting a family is like that.  There is a lot of planning, a lot of work, and a lot of change.

I really wasn't to sure about kids, but it just kinda happened as it tends to. My husband and I got married when I was just about 15 weeks, no one knew but us. It was a very hard pregnancy and traumatic c-section delivery. I am currently having a really hard time bonding with my daughter. I take care of her and would not just stop doing that because that is now my responsibility. But I feel like she's just a baby not specifically my baby. I think she's a little cuter then other babies I see, so I know there is something there. I do care about her. My husband has 2 older kids and keep telling me it will get easier to relate once she can do more. I do feel like it was a mistake to have kids this early. It is hard to be a parent when you do not feel fulfilled or rewarded by it. It really makes me sad to feel that way and I know it's not her fault, I don't blame her for how I feel at all. It's very compacted feelings and hard to deal with. I don't think it will be a forever feeling though. I feel like I'm just still waiting for that clicking moment where I feel like a mother, like this is my child. Some people have told me it's because I wasn't ready, because I didn't have some instinctual maternal want to be a mother, because of the pregnancy and delivery; really I am unsure of the reason. I think it just takes some mothers longer. It takes dad a while to build a bond why can't that happen to mothers too? It's hard when people make me feel like there is something wrong with me because of my feelings. It kinda makes me take 2 steps back in the process. It makes it hard to be honest and open about my feelings when I feel like I'll be marked by the beast and burned at the stake. That's more or less how my family makes me feel about it. My husband has really been my rock and he has bonded with her so well. He isn't so new at this though so that probably helps. I would be really lost and doing a lot worse without him. He is really helping me and encouraging me about this. I think even if women are feeling like I do, having someone there to help that is really good at it makes a world of difference. I read all these books about how the mother is the life line of the child, but my body hated pregncey, failed me in the area of natural labor and refused to allow me connect with my daughter through breastfeeding. I wish I had read a book about how to bond with out those things, but you never expect it to happen any other way.

Growing up I had two MUCH younger brothers, so had quite a bit of experience with the day to day care of babies, and knew how much work it would be.  Through most of my twenties I sort of assumed I'd eventually do it but wasn't with the right person, plus I was SO busy and really enjoyed my life so much, it was hard to imagine a baby.  As I entered my thirties I actually started to come down more on the \"no children\" side of things.  I had a great life - I LOVED living on my own.  I was deeply involved in things I loved. I really was living exactly the life I wanted for myself - if you had asked me what I wanted for myself when I was younger, I was exactly there.  I had found an amazing guy, and though we'd talked a little about kids it was always in the \"oh someday\" column, not something I was as serious about as I should have been.\n\nWhen I found out I was pregnant I really didn't know how to take it.  I was 33, and knew exactly how much I'd be giving up.  I considered going to planned parenthood.  I cried, a lot.  I was totally overwhelmed because I knew I would have to give up so much of what I loved about my life if I was going to be a good parent.  Fortunately I am with an amazing, amazing man who challenges me all the time to be a better person, and who has turned out to be a great dad.  In the end I decided after spending time with a friend's daughter, that maybe, just maybe, I could do this thing.  Once I made that decision I still wouldn't say I was ecstatic about it. I was very torn between feeling deep love and wonder at being pregnant, and being depressed.  I spent a good deal of time being scared out of my wits.\n\nHe is ten months old now and he is magic.  I love everything about him, I live and breath him.  He is amazing and I guess after a few bumps I've settled into being a mother quite well.  \n\nI won't lie - it's been hard to adapt to some things. I am very far away from people I used to think were close friends, and don't hear much from them anymore.  I feel lonely sometimes.  The day to day work is exhausting (every day I get home from work and start getting ready for the next).  Because I'm breastfeeding it's hard for me to go get \"me\" time and do the things I enjoy independently.  Daddit is wonderful and is totally there for that, but I'm never fully \"away\" since I have to lug the pump everywhere if I go to get time for myself.   Every once in a while I get in an actual funk, because a lot of what I predicted when I was newly pregnant has come true.  I miss people, I miss my old lifestyle, I miss a lot. I feel totally removed from my old life now, kind of like it was some dream. \n\nIt's simultaneously the hardest and most wonderful thing I've ever done.  Sometimes I love him so much I feel like my chest is going to explode with the force of it.  I've never experienced this kind of emotion and connection with anybody ever before.  And that is something pretty amazing.  I don't think I ever knew it was possible to feel this way :)  \n\n", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1351022580, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": 1351023059, "gilded": 0, "id": "c6qogxf", "link_id": "t3_11sowa", "parent_id": "t3_11sowa", "retrieved_on": 1430220756, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"archived": true, "author": "omtothenom", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "why are some people that were in your life before not a part of it now?

When I got close to having the baby I moved in with my SO, well over an hour away.  So I'm geographically far from everyone, which is a problem in itself.\n\nPlus none of them have kids, and in fact it's generally an anti-baby group of people (common for folks living that lifestyle), so we don't relate as well.  \n\nI tried for a while to keep up with things, I managed to make it to book clubs, dinners, or other events, would go visit on weekends, tried to text and email people to keep up, but mothering has been exhausting too, and it seems like if I don't do those things, they don't happen.  Which has led me to feel a little abandoned and lonely.

I dunno.  \n\nOr maybe everyone just gets caught up in their own life, time passes quickly, and out of sight is out of mind.
