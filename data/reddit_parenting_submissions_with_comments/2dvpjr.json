I only change my son before a feeding when he's already up, but the warm wipes help to keep him in a sleepy state. Also, I've used it numerous times to warm washcloths and damp cotton pads for other uses. I've found it very handy. \n\n2) Baby Keurig - I don't have one of these, but I came very close to getting one. The appeal for me was it meant my baby would spend less time crying. If I mix formula on demand, all the bubbles give my baby very painful gas. If I make it ahead of time, my baby has to wait 5 minutes while I warm a bottle. We've opted for the latter and just try to anticipate when he's going to be hungry, but, for a while, it was heartbreaking to me that my baby had to scream for 5 minutes every time he was hungry because I'm not able to breastfeed. Anything that made the process easier for him, I would consider. This device is supposed to quickly make formula on demand without bubbles. The only reason I didn't get one is because the reviews seemed to overwhelmingly agree that they broke all the time.
