It's a little like the SAHM thing, which I am.

He will be gone all day doing something fun and then is worn out and angry if I want him to do parenting things.  \n\nIt is funny that your husband cranked that your daughter was leaving because he wanted to see her and yet what he wanted to do was sleep.  Did he want her to stay home from the party and just be in the house sleeping while he slept? \n\nHonestly I try not to feel angry and bitter about this attitude.  I have a right to feel angry and bitter.  I have a reason to feel angry and bitter.  I am entitled to feel angry and bitter.\n\nThe problem?  The only thing I was left with was feeling angry and bitter.  My bad feelings didn't change him.  All they did was make me feel bad.

I try to have everything that might be needed  available and I write a note with details about snacks, meals, drinks, potty issues, activities he might set my son up with and so on..\n\nIf my need to ask him to do solo care of my son is unexpected I often point out a few activities and snacks that my son enjoys and I have things he likes set aside to keep the novelty fresh.\n\nShould I have to do all this?  No.  Do I know woman who have partners who assume that often and unanticipated care of the children alone is part of it all and regularly care for their kids without getting bent out of shape?  Yep.  Do I get jealous and bitter and feel like 'why not me? why don't I deserve that partner?'  You bet I do! Two of my sisters have husbands who are a thousand times more involved fathers than my husband.  But I didn't get super dad.  I got my husband whom I love and who has many other fine qualities but gets childish and irritable and sometimes even mean about unanticipated responsibility for my son.  So I try to avoid surprising him and deal with a certain amount of jerkiness when it is unavoidable.  \n\nSo having been there and done that you have all of my sympathy a hundred fold and you are within reason to be pissed but try and not live in that feeling if you can because it is an ugly place that hurts you and you deserve to feel good.", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1376236769, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": 1376237168, "gilded": 0, "id": "cblixdf", "link_id": "t3_1k59vb", "parent_id": "t3_1k59vb", "retrieved_on": 1429867674, "score": 14, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"archived": true, "author": "tootsiepopz", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "I'm glad I'm not the only one.

More dark than I can express.  It also happened to be a day where my husband was going to be gone the entire day but was coming home for one hour.  I was all twisted up and miserable and I just was sick and tired of feeling so horrible. I decided that the only person suffering was me and even though I had good reason to feel the way I did I just couldn't bear it anymore and I was going to take charge of my feelings and do whatever it would take to feel peace regardless of how entitled I was to feel otherwise.\n\nOn that day I put on my smile, changed my clothes, styled my hair and make-up to look decent and pushed my son in his car to the park.  I texted my husband that we were looking forward to the time we had to be together in the midst of his busy day and would enjoy it if he met us at the park.\n\nI went from feeling like I was in hell to feeling pretty good and in charge.  My husband did meet us at the park and I had him snap a pic of me and my son.  The picture came out gorgeous and I am not photogenic so it ends up being a picture I cherish because not only do I look good but I see it as a reminder that I decided that day that I was going to take charge of my happiness no matter the circumstance and that I was going to do whatever I could to help my son have the best dad my husband could be by accepting who my husband is rather than who I wish he was.\n\nI wish I could say that I made the decision not to be bitter once and never struggled again.  That would be a lie.  The decision to be happy and do what it takes to stay that way has to be renewed often.  For me looking at that picture helps.  Also I wrote a letter to myself reminding myself of all the things my husband does that are fantastic that I look at when I am focused on his attitude about parenting.  Also I sometimes imagine not having his help at all and how hard that would be.  I mean even though I have to prep him well I can trust him to do it and I know women who don't have any help who can't so much as go out for coffee without struggling to find a volunteer or forking over wads of cash to a sitter. Also I try to remember important areas that I am poor at where my husband shoulders more of the burden and how he doesn't act bitter and mean about my shortcomings. (my husband is the social gatherer in our relationship for instance) I try to love my husband for who he is not who I wish he was and try to view the extra prepping he needs to be a good dad as a loving gesture rather than a martyrdom.\n\nAnyway I am rambling and maybe not making sense.  The tl:dr; One day I said enough is enough and took responsibility for my happiness and decided I would do whatever it took to feel peace. I often have to remind myself about that resolve but it is worth it.\n \n\n", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1376239571, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": 1376240045, "gilded": 0, "id": "cbljrqi", "link_id": "t3_1k59vb", "parent_id": "t1_cblj54u", "retrieved_on": 1429867240, "score": 24, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"archived": true, "author": "Marlboro_Gold", "author_flair_css_class": "purple", "author_flair_text": "SAHM 7,4,&amp; 1 BOYS!!", "body": "It happens to us all from time to time.
