It got so bad that the guidance counselor gave me her cell number to txt her if we couldn\u2019t find him any other rides. Last year was rough I\u2019m not going to lie he was angry all the time and moody and just down right grump ! So he literally lost everything, he didn\u2019t have a phone all of his gaming systems were taken away at one point he even lost his tv.  He just barely passed last year he struggled with bad depression. He seen a therapist for a little bit to work through his depression and anger issues got him through school he is a junior this year by the skin of his teeth. Over the summer he wanted his learners but he had to earn them ( show some respect and responsibility) his birthday is in July. He got a summer job at the local seafood restaurant and earned everything back even got to get his leaners before going back to school this year. Normally he\u2019ll get up on his own this year sometimes I have to go wake him up but it\u2019s usually me opening his door and turning his light on he gets up and get in the shower and gets to the bus on time. But we also have a rule when schools in no gaming Monday -Thursday unless there\u2019s no school the next day. We have Verizon cell service so we have the family app and I can put a timer on his phone to stop use at a certain time but he can still contact us during them hours. We also have our cable set up so I can turn WiFi off in any room of the house ( their gaming devices ). My middle daughter just started middle school this year so she\u2019s got to get up early and catch the bus she started with the missing bus but I nipped that in the butt but putting a timer on her phone for bedtime so from 9:00 pm - 5:30am ( they both get up at 5:30 A.M. he catches the bus at 6:20am and she catches the bus at 6:40am sometimes I let her sleep till 6:00am is she doesn\u2019t need to shower).  It\u2019s working for is so far this year so we\u2019ll just keep what we\u2019re doing till next year and see what happens. \nI wish you the best of luck at times i wanted to pull my hair out !
