Will it ever end?  Does it ever get easier?  WHEN!?\n\nThat's not to say that kids aren't worth it, but being a parent can be stressful, and as much as we love our kids, there can be a lot of love-hate going on towards the responsibility, sacrifices, and limitations that family life imposes.

I know, I've been there. After my first child was born, I had a severe case. Unfortunately, my husband's job didn't allow for him to help me out the way you're doing. Most of the time, I was left to do it all myself 24/7 while he was out of state for his job, and only home on weekends. I was also determined not to admit that I had PPD because, as someone else mentioned, admitting it made me feel like I was a failure. It sounds like your wife might be suffering from PPD or anxiety or something along those lines. I know that if my husband was able to help with our girls in the capacity that you are, I'd be far from stressed out. Is there a way that you can approach the subject without upsetting her too much? Or does she maybe have a close friend that she feels safe confiding in? Perhaps another mom who can commiserate with her? Maybe have them mention something like \" You seem kinda blue lately, are you feeling okay? I know when my child was born, I had some blues after.\" Sometimes it helps just knowing that you're not the only person in the world suffering from it. Also gather some resources for her, or at least know where she can go to get resources to help. My OBGYN office this time around was a great resource for me. By the time that I got pregnant with my second, I was ready to admit that I had a problem when my first was little. This went in my file, so by the time my second was born, they knew. My midwife gave me a list of numbers right before I had my daughter  \"just in case\" and said that if all else failed, I could call her if I felt overwhelmed. We also talked about some of the signs and symptoms and things to look out for, since I didn't get help or even admit there was a problem the first time around. It definitely left me feeling more confident this time. We mommies are proud creatures. Sometimes it just takes a gentle push in the right direction to get us to admit that we need help without feeling like complete failures.

I'm finding it interesting that you have him from 230 pm until he goes to bed (so like 7-830 or something?) and she is still so overwhelmed. I'm not saying this is her fault or anything like that of course. It just throws up a red flag for me. \n\nI really think you should consider counseling or something like that for her. Perhaps the two of you could go together if that would make her more comfortable. Good luck! I really hope your wife feels better soon!
