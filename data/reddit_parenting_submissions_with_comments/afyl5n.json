As beautiful and addicting as my baby and our time together is, my partner is having such a hard time understanding how my hormones effect my day to day wellbeing and patience and overall happiness. We\u2019ve been struggling so much since baby came being that postpartum depression hit me pretty hard and my attitude has been less than kind or patient with him. It\u2019s so frustrating because he just simply doesn\u2019t GET what this is like; what the constant worry is like, what the exhaustion with breastfeeding is like, he doesn\u2019t experience these emotions. I know having mom friends would be good for me and being around female energy is something I\u2019m seriously lacking but other moms are so hard to relate to. \n\nI\u2019m convinced that (in my experience at least) dad doesn\u2019t truly bond with baby until baby becomes a bit more independent of me, dad hardly even holds baby or feels comfortable being alone with him because baby tends to cry right away being that dad doesn\u2019t fully understand his cues or what he likes. On top of the typical anxiety and stress of being a new mother I constantly worry when baby\u2019s alone with dad. Not that he\u2019s incompetent or careless, he loves our son every bit as much as I do, he just seems to have less patience and is not as attentive as I am. Lately he seems to just want to bring baby to the nanny when I\u2019m gone, I can tell baby\u2019s discomfort with him is giving him a lot of anxiety. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do to help dad feel better around baby and also to stop breathing down dad\u2019s neck every time he\u2019s alone with little one. I feel like I\u2019m going crazy waiting for something terrible to happen when I\u2019m at work during the day. Really struggling here.

It can be really difficult for the other partner to 'get' what we go through. The only thing that helped my hubby was more time with the baby - alone. It's really the only way for them to learn baby's cues and let them bond. For me the hardest part was trusting my hubby. And not that he's not the most amazing father (he really truly is amazing with my little guy) but it's hard to let go of those mama bear instincts plus I'm a little bit of a type A so it was not easy. I literally had to talk it out to myself when I left them alone (sometimes just to have a nice long shower, nap or even just a hike with the dogs). \n\nI understand him handing off to the nanny, it seems easy and safe to him because he thinks the nanny knows better than him but in reality it's really hindering his getting to know his baby. And I think that's a big thing that people don't realize, you give birth to a COMPLETE STRANGER! Even you, as a mom, are getting to know this little human and we tend to spend more time with them feeding/have more time off at first so it looks like it's easier for us to other people (aka our spouses) and they don't understand we struggled figuring out these little ppl just as much as they do.\n\nTo top off everything I've said so far is PPD or PPA. The hormones after birth can really mess with your head and it's not joke. If you have not yet, please speak with your doctor about how you are feeling to make sure you are getting all the help you need.

Should they be near the baby? Is it rude to ask them to not touch her? It was awful. My husband was great, he really wanted to help but I worried and would be tense when he held her. I didn\u2019t sleep, and when i did i would wake up in a panic. My only consolation to offer is that it gets so much better, and soon too. My daughter is 6 months old and while I still have waves of anxiety, she\u2019s sturdy, her dad can do things with her, we have a semi solid routine down, and she seems like she\u2019s pretty happy.

It\u2019s the part of baby making I wish people would communicate about more. I was an anxious mess for weeks and worried I wouldn\u2019t come out of the sad, worried cloud, but I did. \n\nMy husband bonded immediately. He held that baby for the first time and looked at him with immense, overpowering  love. I didn\u2019t. I wanted a shower and a nap, and that baby to just sleep for a while. I don\u2019t put much stake in all that first moment stuff. Our love is our actions. We do our best by our kids and love grows. \n\nI don\u2019t think my husband ever really gets what it\u2019s like. Today, my sick toddler throws up all over me. I take him to the bath and calm my little bub down. We play. I bring him back to dad, in a towel, after being thrown up on, and this clueless man lets this baby follow me to my closet to change. I try to explain that I need a minute, as in it\u2019s his turn to watch this kid and literally keep him away from me for a minute  . He says \u201che should like me more\u201d and I say \u201cI don\u2019t care how much he likes you right now, I need a minute. He could\u2019ve just cried for a minute so I can have a breather.\u201d But no. No breather for me. Because husband does not get the emotional toll of momming. Not REALLY He is dad. That said, he\u2019s generally extremely helpful and supportive and does a wonderful job at being a dad. But he\u2019s not a mom. He\u2019s a dad. It am jealous of his dadness often. \n\nYour husband doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s being super supportive and that sucks. Things will get better for you soon! You\u2019ll get this thing down and the anxiety should come down as your mom confidence grows. Mine did. Most moms find they get calmer and more relaxed as baby stop being a potato and starts showing some goddamn appreciation! \ud83d\ude02\n\n If you\u2019re not feeling progress in the next couple weeks, I\u2019d start pushing for time away from baby with dad taking the reins. You  should do that soon anyway. Leave baby and go to the store. For twenty minutes. Or just a step outside, maybe for a quick walk around the block. I also fought for bath time and I trained my husband to let me have it, but it was a battle too. \n\n Get away and remind yourself you are a whole person apart from your child and your life will regain balance soon! Hold that man accountable, but reflect and plan tough conversations before you start them, if possible. Say what you need. Tell him you\u2019re sad and anxious and struggling.
