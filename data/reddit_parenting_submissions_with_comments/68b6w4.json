My s/o and I battled for a very long time on names before we finally decided on the name Roman for our little boy. Near the end of my pregnancy I started getting cold feet on the name, but pushed aside my feelings thinking that he would come out and the name would work for him despite my fears of it not fitting. Boy, was I wrong. \n\nHe came out and I instantly knew in my gut that we had chosen the wrong name. Still, that was the only name we could agree on for months so I went with it. Now he's almost 4 weeks old and I absolutely HATE it. My s/o says he'll \"earn it\" or \"grow into it\" and I just don't think so. When we chose the name we thought we were going to have a dark haired baby with a dark complexion. Instead we've got this adorable blonde-haired blue-eyed anomaly. I know his features could still change, but i don't think I'll ever be happy with his name. \n\nSeveral people have told me that they like the name, but it doesn't fit him. It hurts my heart every single day that I don't want to say my baby's name out loud and I normally just end up calling him a funny nickname when referring to him. I want to be able to snuggle him and when he cries be able to say \"it's okay, baby's name. Mama's here.\"  It just tastes weird coming out. I almost want to cry typing this. \n\nWhat I'm asking is basically, are there any other mamas out there that have had a similar situation? What did you do about it? Will I ever get used to it? I'm also looking for suggestions on names. I'm in love with the name Liam for him, but his dad hates that, and we're back at square one where we can't agree on anything. I'd like to change it as soon as possible if that's the route we decide to take. I'm adding a couple pictures of the little nugget as well and asking for suggestions from you ladies on names you think might fit. Thanks! \n\n\n[newborn photos](https://imgur.com/gallery/RLI1A)\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Help!

It's not unheard of to change a baby's name, so if you and your husband can compromise on one, attempt it quickly.  \n\nA strange thought maybe but I don't want you to rule it out... post pregnancy hormones can be a birch and can affect everyone in really unique ways.  PPD can make make otherwise loving mother's feel no attatchment to their babies.

I expected she'd have brown eyes eventually since those are dominant genes.  When she came out nearly red headed and a clone of her father I was kind of confused.  Her eyes never changed from blue and she stayed blond to this day despite two dark brown haired parents.  I think it was a few months before I really adjusted.  We named her the day she was born so I had to grow into her name and accepting who she was, not to mention all the other stress of motherhood, like breastfeeding.  Today I can't imagine her looking any different,  being named any different, she's beautiful and smart and troublesome and funny.  \n\n\nFunny story, my second child, also a girl, was the baby I had planned for.  Shock of dark hair, big fat face, looked just like me.  I was in awe of her.  She's grown to become a mini me to her big sister, but I really bonded with her differently because she was so obviously mine.  Not better by any means, but differently.  I think there's research out there that shows most babies are born looking like their paternal relatives, it encourages men to bond with the baby because the relation is obvious.

I don't know if the rules are the same elsewhere, but my point is that it exists because it's relatively common.\n\n3) when my son was born, I really questioned if we had picked the right name. It was a name that I had come up with and managed to win my husband over to loving it too. But once he was born, I really struggled with it. I'm so glad we didn't change it though. He's 18 months now and running around being mischievous and his name fits him so well.  I think what maybe made it difficult at first was that it just felt WEIRD to call him by name.

My husband and I discussed names for what seemed like forever and finally decided on one after about 7 months into the pregnancy. Our daughter had a unisex name and we wanted to follow that trend and give our son a unisex name as well. While his name is definitely a boy's name it's not the most masculine name out there. I assumed he would be born weighing about 9 pounds like his sister had, so I didn't think too much about his name not fitting him in those terms. When he was born at 12 pounds, I had three distinctive thoughts: \n1. There is my beautiful baby boy! \n2. Holy crap that kid is huge!\n3. Oh no, we have chosen the wrong name! \nTo me, he didn't look like the name we had chosen for him in the slightest and it gnawed at me. I asked everyone what they thought and everyone tentatively agreed that he didn't really match his name because he was born so big and brawny, like he should have been named Bruno or something hyper-masculine. Also, because we had already told virtually everyone in the world his name before he had even graced us with his presence, I felt foolish to back peddle and name him something different at the time of his birth (a silly notion of course). He could have gone by his middle name as it would have suited him or even his first and middle initials, but I hated that idea. I was terrified this kid would grow up with a complex about his name or identity and he would never forgive his mother for her indecisiveness or at the very least, her inability to chose a decent name for her son. Obviously that is an over-exaggeration but in my mind at the time I was so scared that I had somehow started the wheels of some awful life long identity crisis. In reality, my son is now almost two and he fits his name to a tee. I could not imagine him as anything else but the name that I had so painstakingly agonised over. My point is that it is ultimately up to you whether or not you can imagine your son with the name you had chosen for him, but as someone who has been there I am very happy that I stuck with my son's original name. \n\nYour son is gorgeous by the way and I think that he definitely could be a Roman. :)\n", "can_gild": true, "created_utc": 1493563839, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dgy3blv", "link_id": "t3_68b6w4", "parent_id": "t3_68b6w4", "retrieved_on": 1493563840, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"author": "yourgirlsamus", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "This may not be true for your baby but I thought I'd throw it out there, my besties baby is biracial.
