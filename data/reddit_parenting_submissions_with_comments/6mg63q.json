Mom has spent ~9 months with baby inside, part of it moving around. And then the miracle of childbirth can have an overwhelming affect on the person doing as opposed to the person witnessing it. \n\n- **the first few weeks of a child's life where Mom is recovering from the birth and Dad is busy keeping the rest of the world from crumbling in on them**. This is usually a completely pragmatic decision based on capability and bandwidth between the Mom and Dad. Then, as much human behavior seems to model, these roles turn into patterns of behavior that extend past the recovery period. Sometimes '*life*' makes that transition from ~80/20 to 50/50 difficult to impossible.\n\nNever disregard the effect stress can have on complacency regarding a less-than-ideal situation. Before the couple knows it, they're acting out the more 'traditional' roles 'because ruts', regardless of their previous perspectives on them. \n\nAdd to this the breastfeeding aspect that some have, and Mom may have a stronger psychological bond than Dad with the child merely because they are forced into positions of care that Dad cannot possibly replicate (*without formula, anyway*). That will always put Mom at an advantage for increased empathy/sympathy/concern towards the child/children. \n\nAdd to this multiple children, poverty, environmental stressors (*like Grandma lives with the family, or more than Grandma*) and you can have something that appears traditional but is really just pragmatic, nothing more. **Many couples are just people forced into positions they'd rather not be in, but do it because that's what it takes to make it work at all.**\n\n**Personal Note**\n\nAs a liberal Dad (*voted for Barak twice! I love that man!*) I personally took it to heart that I didn't want to fall into the traditional roles that Mom and Dad fall into. It was based on my assumption that the vast majority of parent couples before me did it because of their ignorant assumptions of the 'proper roles' of women and men that insulted women. \n\nHowever, I can say now with two little ones under toe in under a year, that Mom and I do what we do because that's how we can get it done best for our boys. Mom could 'work' as well or better than I could, and in fact is now looking into ending her career hiatus earlier than we first considered she might. Alternately, I could easily be a SAHD and she could be the single breadwinner in our family- I'd love that! But it didn't start out that way, and for a while after our start it became insane to consider re-aligning things simply for the sake of re-aligning them so as to not appear 'traditional'. Instead, we continued to do what worked until we saw the light of day (*Irish twins will keep you buried for at least a year and half!*). Also, every decision made was made based on what worked best while keeping as many options away from it open as we could (*in case the decision didn't pan out well*).
