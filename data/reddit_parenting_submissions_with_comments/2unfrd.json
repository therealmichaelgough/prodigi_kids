She said she hated the feeling of being stuck those first 3 weeks. But then like magic they left and she thought she was relieved.

I asked her what her thought process was and why would she do this to me, her response was that I looked well enough, I was glowing (adrenaline high), walking, joking around.

Big box electronics stores were easy to give up. And I should not be buying as much from Amazon as I should either. \n\nBut at some point, what are my alternatives? I'm also part of the labour market as a labourer. My wages, as an average middle class worker, have been stagnant for the last fifty years as part of this paradigm. Where am I getting the money to be able to choose fantastic upstarts over giants with efficient (ie, minimally paying employer) supply and distribution chains, for every single thing I need to purchase?\n\nDo you believe that consumers are the major force that drive business models? That if enough of us chose ethical options they would replace current giants like Walmart and Target and Chipotle and Burger King and Coca Cola? Maybe if we, as an entire segment of the population, had significant spending power. But we don't, because of aforementioned decrease in buying power over the last fifty years. \n\nMeanwhile these types of cooperations have had more than that amount of time and accumulated capital to influence government policies in their favour.

Buy local and buy ethical. But, also, go out and vote and rally for policies that benefit society, like unions and raising wages and fair treatment of workers and having fixed schedules and OT compensation. \n\nIt will happen for our children though.
