Would appreciate any and all guidance on this matter.\n\nI'm a single mother of five boys, the oldest being almost 17. My youngest child is 3, turning 4 in November. \n\nAll of my kids were late talkers, including my youngest. He cannot communicate with me as much as other 3 year olds do with their parents. He can recognise Peppa Pig characters and amazingly, he can navigate a phone much better than my father in law! However, he never lets me know when he's soiled his nappy and instead runs upstairs and lies down there. \n\n He is going to nursery next Wednesday and they will not admit any child that is not potty trained. My other kids were potty trained at 2, but this one is very stubborn. Over the past few weeks, when he's wearing nappies/pullups, he doesn't tell me when he's soiled them, and he doesn't want me to change them. \n\nSo today I decided to potty train him and jump straight to underwear. I took out seven pairs of briefs and seven pairs of trousers. And seven times, he peed through his underwear and underwear in the living room / my bedroom, and showed no sign to me that he was either going to pee or he'd already peed. Each time, I got really annoyed and took him to the bathroom and made him sit there, even though he was finished peeing. And he would sit there crying and scratching his arms or knees.\n\nMy other kids want me to just put on his nappies and call it a day. Should I? Am I being too stubborn with him? That last thing I would want is for him to be scared and reluctant to go to the toilet. I've booked an appointment with a health visitor on  Tuesday so that we can discuss this issue and get a note written to the nursery so they can excuse him for not being potty trained.\n\nAny other parents going through or already gone through this issue? How did you solve it? \n\nThank you!

Not sure your location, but in the US we have something called \u201cChild Find.\u201d The public schools are required to handle the testing for all children over the age of 2y 11m. This testing is free. If you are here, contact your local public school system and convey your concerns. They will likely want to do a full evaluation (not just speech and language) involving a school psychologist for emotional behavioral, cognitive, and possibly an Occupational Therapist to consider other delays. \n\n2.) take your son to potty every hour. Reward your child for sitting on the potty. A larger reward for peeing on the potty, and a larger reward for pooping on the potty. I used stickers for sitting, candy for peeing, and $1 toy cars for pooping. You may find an activity that holds his attention to let him play with while on the potty. Make a huge deal out of his success. If he has an accident (wets pants) make no negative statement. Take his hand, walk him to the potty and point, \u201cpee goes in the potty.\u201d Walk him back to where accident happened, and point at spot saying \u201cpee goes in the potty.\u201d Repeat this step 5 times, then sit him on potty for 5 mins unless he fights sitting. This is not a reprimand or punishment. Totally neutral voice and face. If he poops his pants, clean him up, and give him time on potty if he will try. NEVER make a statement about pooping. You do not want to accidentally cause him to withhold. This is bad. \n\nAlso, don\u2019t go back to nappies. Don\u2019t confuse him. This isn\u2019t going to be easy. I may be a long road. But, you got this, Momma! Maybe get undies with a character he really likes and let him know \u201cpaw patrol likes to stay dry. Don\u2019t get him wet. To keep him dry, go pee pee in the potty.\u201d Get a potty chair that is small enough for him to sit on unattended that he is comfortable on. Adult sized potties can be scary for little kids.\n\n3.) please stop the screen time! Now! Research shows the effects of screen time on neural development can mimic ADHD, Emotional Disturbance, and Autism. It significantly delays speech development and hinders social communication. I cannot stress this enough. I have tested many children who have delays related directly to this. \n\n4.) reach out to your pediatrician. They may have resources for you.\n\nPlease know that you aren\u2019t alone. There are many other parents out there with the same struggles.

They are all different and they can\u2019t be forced. Some kids easily take to using the toilet, others take a bit of time and a lot of patience. \n\nI didn\u2019t do any kind of 3-day training with my kids, so I can\u2019t speak to that, but my advice would be to start with normalizing the bathroom talk, if you don\u2019t already. Do this before you even try to implement actual toilet training. This is like setting the scene for him. Instead of making him the focus of going to the bathroom, when you need to use the toilet, announce it to him (ex: \u201cI need to pee. I better go to the potty.\u201d). There are also board books about learning to use the potty that you can read to him each night before bed. \n\nThese acts introduce the concept without laying on the pressure. He is a little human, still kind of new to this world\u2014definitely new to controlling bodily functions that he probably isn\u2019t really even aware that he has\u2014so if your stress is directed at him, he is going to feel it even more than you do. It will have a negative impact on his association with using the toilet and it will just make the process so much harder.\n\nIf he doesn\u2019t talk much, introduce a hand signal (still coupled with the verbal cues from you) to indicate when you need to use the restroom. Sit with him and teach him the sign while simply explaining what it means, not yet expecting that he will use it. \n\nMake these behaviors standard practice in your home until you have spoken with a pediatrician and received the \u201cokay\u201d to begin potty-training. If they think your son may have a developmental delay that could be aggravated by potty-training, they may advise laying off of it until further testing or milestones are reached. \n\nI am not a health professional, so I could be wrong, but I think taking baby steps and seeking the advice of a doctor is the best route.", "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "created_utc": 1535819401, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e57vybe", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_9c3jyu", "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_9c3jyu", "permalink": "/r/Mommit/comments/9c3jyu/my_child_is_3_years_9_months_old_isnt_potty/e57vybe/", "retrieved_on": 1535819402, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"approved_at_utc": null, "author": "vegetariandeadite", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1ryworjo", "banned_at_utc": null, "body": "I can only speak from my own experience. \n\nMy son has delayed speech, he's 4 now and still behind.

This service is free with the *public* school system.\n\nIf your not in the states you might still have a similar service available and it would be worth looking into.\n\nAs far as potty training goes.

The first thing I would say is don't force it. If you try to make it a fight it might just upset the process more especially if he's hurting himself on the potty. Maybe try sitting him on it when neither of you is upset with a favorite toy or book and see if you can get him comfortable just sitting on it. If possible try dumping diaper waste into the toilet and showing him that's where pee/poop goes. Read books about it, cheer on or give little \"prizes\" to other family members when they go etc. All these things will help get him started/ help him understand what you want. I'd also second those who have recommend bringing in a speech therapist to help him communicate better this can help with so many frustrations! They may even be able to help with the potty training.. depending on where you are many public schools will start kids at 3 if they need help catching up to peers and I know many of them will help with potty training as well!

Unfortunately, I'm in England, not the USA :( I'll try to find out if any such scheme exists, however I do know that health visitors are available for support until the age of 5 I think so that will be helpful. \n\nThe issue is, he will never tell me when he is about to pee. Sometimes, he will sit right in front of me and do it and I can't tell because there's no sign. It's only when I see his wet trousers and he gets uncomfortable that I find out. And when I make him sit on the toilet (we haven't got a potty anymore, I think I threw it out years ago!), nothing happens because he's already peed. \n\nI would love to use cartoon characters to encourage him but he doesn't understand. I even repeated the sentence \"Peppa does pee pee in the **toilet**\" about a dozen times but he just sits there and laughs.\n\nAnd as for screen time, I wholeheartedly agree with you: it isn't good. But in a house with one boy in college and two boys in secondary school, you'll find phones, tablets, and laptops everywhere. My son will spend about an hour or two on the sofa watching Peppa Pig on his tablet, and then spend some time on the phone or laptop. He loves going for walks outside so I nag my other sons to take him every now and then. All my sons grew up with electronics. The first four were all using computers in nursery and knew how to operate Word and the like before any of the other kids... I'm not too sure if that's a good thing, though!\n\nI actually gave up a few hours ago and made him wear pullups. Maybe another day... But nevertheless, thank you so much for your support!
