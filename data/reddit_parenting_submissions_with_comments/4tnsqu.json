If it's not let me know and I can take it down. I tried posting in /r/babybumps but I guess this topic is not allowed. I really just need to vent. I'm so sorry, this is going to be long. \n\nMy mom has been my rock since I was a kid. She has made her fair share of mistakes, like everyone, but has always done a great job at fostering honest and open conversation with me, and we almost always come to a happy understanding at the end of a discussion or disagreement. Because of that I'm really kind of reeling from our latest conversation.\n\nMy mom knows that we're having a boy, and has been possibly even more ecstatic than we are about this (very very wanted and anticipated) child. She's known that we were seriously considering not circumcising for quite some time now (at this point we are actually 100% sure that we are not going to circumcise), but now that we're nearing our due date (August 29th!) I've been fielding questions from family, mainly because they want to know if we're having a bris (my side is Jewish, although I'm in no way religious) and she's been dancing around the subject more and more. It finally came to a head yesterday, when she brought it up again, and essentially told me that she thinks that we're making a really big mistake, like to the point that our son will live a more difficult life because of it. I stayed calm, since I really didn't want to get into a fight about it, and we ended the call on a relatively good note. We spoke again today, and although she says that she will love my son no matter what - which I completely believe - she reiterated that she thinks we're making a huge mistake. Specifically that we'll make his life more difficult because of bullying, later in life in sexual encounters, and even just going to pee at a urinal. She also said that she thinks that we're \"putting an undue burden on him that [we] won't have to deal with, but he will, for the rest of his life\", and that we're \"taking the easy way out by choosing to not make a decision about what to do\". She also stated that she thinks that my husband and I are trying to be rebellious against religion (she is in no way a religious person either), and that we're being immature. The worst part though, was when she said that I was putting a burden on him.\n\nThe way I see it, we're giving our son the chance to have an intact body the way that nature intended. Although there's no medical reason NOT to do it, other than the typical risks of surgery that come with every minor procedure, there is also no good reason TO do it, unless there's an issue later in life such as phimosis, which wouldn't be known about until later in life, and is relatively rare. I feel like we're making an informed decision, and one that really isn't pertinent to anyone other than myself, my husband, and most importantly, my son.\n\nAm I being a terrible mother already? Am I making the wrong decision for the wrong reasons? Am I being selfish?\n\nI haven't had a huge emotional breakdown once during this pregnancy, and yet this sent me over the edge. I BAWLED after I got off the phone. I told her how hurt I was by what she said, and she said that I had told her to be honest. I had told her to be honest, but this just felt cruel. I honestly don't understand why she thinks that this is such a huge mistake, and other than saying that she thinks that he'll be ridiculed for his penis, I can't figure out why she feels this strongly about such a relatively benign subject.\n\nUGH. This got so long. I just am so upset over this, and I don't know what to think.

I think this is a part of becoming a parent: you'll have to make decisions for your kid, and A LOT of people will, at least, question those (when not telling you what to do). So, be prepared to stand up for yourself! It looks like you're on the right track, tho.\n\nAnd about circumcision: I'm European, I come from a country where it is not the norm at all to have boys circumcised. And I don't think it makes all of us bad parents :) Plus if your son really wants to do it later in life, it sounds like you'd be open to let him have the procedure done, so it will be up to him. Which is awesome: the way I see it, you're just giving your baby the possibility to make this choice over his body once he's older. You're already considering him as a person on his own, which is great!\n\nStory time: when I told my (not circumcised, male obviously, european) friends that I was, maybe, considering circumcision for my son, they all looked at me with a horrified look on their faces and said \"why would you do that to him??\"\n\nSo yeah, I guess I just wanted to put the whole circumcision debate into perspective. \n\nAnd maybe it is time to make it clear to your mom that this is your decision to make and that you made it already, so there's no point in arguing about it anymore.

I finally didn't because the benefits of it seem to be quite few and almost virtual whereas the pain the baby feels is very real. Not something I would want my baby to experience during his very first days on earth, you know?\n\nThat and the fact that he can still do it later if he wants to. Also since it's not very common in Europe, I'm not even sure how the baby's pain is handled there (according to what I heard on that subject, it seems like there are quite a lot of ways to reduce the pain during and after the procedure in the US).\n\nOh yeah and it seems to be real in the US, but why on earth would kids look at each other's penis??

It always sounds so... straight from movies when I hear about that.\n\nYou know, I really feel you. When you become a parent, your relationship with your own parents can change a lot (not always in a bad way!!) but it hurts so much, specially when pregnant and imagining the life ahead, when someone you love and trust (here your mother) isn't on the same page as you. Plus it is hard for new grandparents sometimes to transition and be aware that they are not the ones who make decisions anymore, that their child is an adult with their own child. Do you think your husband, who may be less emotional right now, could explain to your mom that it's not even about circumcision, it's about the fact that when becoming a mother yourself, you'd feel much better if you could have you own mom's support? Or do you think she feels too strongly about circumcision to even hear that and drop it? I'm having a hard time imagining that this is something so important to her that she'd rather hurt you over this.\n\nOr you could go scorched earth and show her videos of circumcision but I do think it's a bit brutal and maybe not going to the root of the problem.\n\nHang in there mama, you're gonna be a dope parent :)", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1469017363, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "d5jg9vx", "link_id": "t3_4tnsqu", "parent_id": "t1_d5iuh3z", "retrieved_on": 1471553398, "score": 5, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"author": "morbuque", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "You're perfectly right, no penis cutting over here unless god asked for it :) That's why my friends were so startled when I asked their opinions about it!\n\nI considered it because it's a very common procedure in the US, so I thought it may be beneficial in some ways?

Wanting to offer my own two cents. Maybe the best way to sum up this whole discussion is focusing on the word \"decision\"... why circumcising a newly-born baby boy should have to be a \"decision\" in the first place? there is already a lot of stress put upon any soon-to-be parent and is just so horribly unethical from hospital staff in the US to even ask if parents \"want\" to have their child surgically altered, when is not even their own body to begin with (is the child's penis). I can't blame your mother for her views when there has been a whole pervasive cultural thing going on trying to make genital mutilation of babies okay (either on religious or supposedly \"medical\" grounds). In the end she will have to come to terms with your decision, you just have to stay strong; I honestly feel she has good intentions and the love for you and her grandson will prevail... and if she ever brings the subject again, well, you will always have the last word, as after all YOU are the mother and anyone can say what they want, but you are the one in charge of caring for your son, not them, and you already keep his best interest in mind.\n\nI really have to praise you and all those young mothers in the USA, certainly a new generation, who are changing the tides and stopping what has been a horrible tradition pushed mostly for greed (because US hospitals make a lot of money from amputating babies, without a care for the supposed oath to \"not harm\").
