And honestly, if I watched someone eating in a public pool I would judge them and side-eye them as doing something inappropriate. I feel the same way about breastfeeding in a pool. If it's against pool rules to eat in a pool, the same should apply for breastfeeding. As far as being illegal, that seems extreme, but as far as socially acceptable, I think it's gross and inconsiderate the same way I think eating a slice of pizza in a pool is kind of gross and inconsiderate. And to go with this, even though there's a certain amount of natural bodily fluids getting into the pool, we'd still look kind of funny or with outright hostility at someone who purposefully put them there or encouraged their kid too. I'd say a young child throwing up a stomach full of juice is about as sanitary/unsanitary as a kid throwing up breastmilk, but you'd probably still give a mom the stink eye if she sent her kid to go throw up into the pool rather than ushering him out or towards a more appropriate spot. Same if you heard a mom tell her kid to just pee in the pool, or if you saw a mom give her kids some sort of really messy food to eat while in the food like fudgesicles or something. There's a huge difference between the incidentals of body fluids ending up there and a parent happily dumping more of theirs and their kids in there because \"its natural\". There are a LOT of ways that breastfeeding mothers are discriminated against, being asked to sit on the edge of the pool if they're going to breastfeed or get out entirely is not that at all.

There are people who feel it's more natural and comfortable for their baby to be in only a cloth diaper.  They are still expected to put their baby in a swimmy diaper when in a public pool/lake/ocean/whatever because it's common decency to not expose others to their child's bodily fluids.  Breastmilk might be less gross or harmful than urine or feces, but it's still a bodily fluid that I have a right to not be exposed to.\n\nI'm not asking the baby to \"conform\", I'm asking the mother to have common courtesy.  I am pro-breastfeeding, but I don't think that being asked to refrain from doing it in a place where it's unacceptable for anyone else to eat is really \"discrimination\".  It's being asked to follow the same rules as everyone else.  \n\nI'm aware that breastfeeding is also used for comfort.  That has nothing to do with needing to breastfeed *in* the pool.  If your baby is distressed, take him/her out of the pool and breastfeed next to the pool, or sitting with just your feet in even.\n\nYou've been incredibly hostile to everyone in this thread who disagrees with you.

I do disagree, but it's got nothing to do with decency or what's socially acceptable. I don't think breastmilk in the water is harmful to anyone else, but I do worry about babies consuming chlorine even though the levels in pools are usually low enough to be harmless when ingested. \n\nBut by the same token, I also wouldn't take a kid younger than six months or so into a pool just because the sanitation and chemical issues concern me.
