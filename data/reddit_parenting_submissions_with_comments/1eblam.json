But the birth setting made me uncomfortable. And when most people who do home births say they they didn't go to the hospital, they don't mean that the baby wasn't seen by a medical professional. The midwife keeps tabs on the baby, they suction out the fluids from the chest, just not right away, they perform the tests, and they make sure to visit and do check-ups. My son goes to a holistic doctor, who was schooled in modern medicine, and we try to go the natural way before trying medicines that the body sometimes doesn't take to very well.

There is no way that your friend's \"90%\" quote isn't a gross, gross exaggeration.

Homebirths themselves do not *cause* heart disease or defects.  Those babies were going to be sick no matter where or how they were born.  The difference is that babies who's parents choose traditional prenatal care often have their defects diagnosed at the 20 week anatomy scan.  They've had fetal echocardiograms and conferred with pediatric cardiac surgeons before birth.  The medical staff is ready for that sick baby the moment it's born, and provides the necessary care.
