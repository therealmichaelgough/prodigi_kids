I definitely felt disappointed when I found out my first was a boy. The weird thing was that before I got pregnant, when my SO and I first started talking about the idea of having a baby, we immediately thought of it as a boy, and had a name for him, and we even bought some boy pajamas for our future baby. But once we got pregnant, I got so into the idea of a girl, I named her, I picked out her whole nursery theme and had a bookmark list of everything I would get, I wrote letters to \"her\", and then it was a boy. I don't know how or why, but once I had him, it just felt perfect. He felt like the most cuddly, sweet, lovable thing in the world. My friend had just had a girl, and for awhile, I even started feeling sort of weird about baby girls. I thought girls seemed different, or less cute and loving. I couldn't imagine cuddling a baby girl and it feeling as warm and sweet as my boy. Now, he's a crazy 17 month old boy, and he is just so wild and cute. He runs around all day, loves playing with dinosaurs, cars, blocks, he loves running around and jumping and stuff with his dad, and he loves making the funniest noises. He's rambunctious and hilarious! And when he's sleepy, he goes right back to being my sweet, precious baby boy and I just love how it feels to hold him! Now, I'm 21 weeks pregnant and again had been so hoping that I would have that girl, but it's a boy again. I'm still sort of in that gender disappointment phase now. I don't feel as connected to this baby, I don't feel that excited. I feel sort of like, I have already done all of the boy pregnancy stuff, and the only thing that made this pregnancy feel like a novelty was that I thought it would be a girl. But, luckily, now I know that despite this feeling, I'm going to love this little boy and I know that it will turn out to be amazing, better than I can imagine right now. I am so excited to see what it's like to have two little boys, how they'll react to having brothers. I'm excited to see if this boy is like my bigger boy (it would be so funny to have to wild, loud, hilarious little boys running around!) or if this boy will be more quiet or sensitive, which would be sweet in it's own way. I guess what I'm saying is that I guarantee you it will be better than anything you can imagine, and you will definitely love having a little boy! \n\nI have to admit, I am scared I will never get a little girl. My current \"plan\" is six children- I'm a young mom, so I've got at least a couple more decades of baby making time ahead of me. I'm scared that none of them will be girls. I don't mind if they are all boys and one girl, I just want to have both experiences. I can't imagine what having a daughter feels like, I just want to know so badly how it feels to see my little girl. Plus, I want to see my SO have a father daughter relationship, I just want to see how he would be with a daughter. I'm sort of emotional about it.

I so badly wanted a little copy of myself, a tiny little lady who I could teach to love art &amp; nature &amp; animals. A funny, charming girl who I could teach to be confident &amp; silly &amp; smart. Her smile would light up a room. She had a name picked out, I had a perfect picture of her in my head.\n\n Last July I found out, @ 17wks pregnant, that I was having a boy... for SURE, he made it very very obvious. The experience was surreal... I tried to be positive, but a small part of me felt like my dream was shattered. I had to completely reimagine who my child would be.\n\nAs we started decorating his room,  registering for his stuff, organizing his clothes... I started to come to terms with it. Part of me still longed for my girl, but it was getting better. \nNovember 13th, 2014 my son was born. A healthy, big, handsome boy who looks JUST like me. Immediately every doubt or disappointment about his gender melted away. He was perfect. \n\nAlmost 4 months later, I am SO in love with my boy. He is hilarious, makes the greatest facial expressions and has a smile that lights up the darkest nights. He is so happy, so sweet, so affectionate. He is every single thing I wanted, he can grow up to be everything I had planned, or even become someone so much better than I ever could have imagined. \n\nMy husband &amp; I plan to try for #2 in about a year. I said today that I really wouldn't have even a shred of disappointment if #2 was a boy... or if we only ever have boys. I know now what an amazing blessing it is to be a mother to my son, and I wouldn't trade him for anything.
