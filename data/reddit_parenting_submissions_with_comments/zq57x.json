She knocked my car off the road, totaling it. \n \nMy perfect 1 year old little girl has been to hospitals, specialists, and was at one time thought to have a brain tumor because her eyes just started wandering. CT scans are heartbreaking, especially when they had to give her enough propofol to knock out an elephant.  \n\nI couldn't pick up my babies for about a week because of my back and neck injuries. Could you even imagine not being able to hold your babies because of physical pain caused by someone's stupidity? My husband lost so many work hours, and I couldn't take pain pills because I had to take care of the kids when he finally did go back to work. It was agonizing when my back would spasm and shake from picking up my children. \n\nMy daughter's eyes will never be the same from the trauma of taking the brunt of the impact. (her car hit my daughters door) The eye specialist said she will have to do vision therapy, glasses, and eye patches. All of that is hard to do with a 2 year old, and very expensive to the grand total of $635 for 2 pairs. \n\nThis is just a rant as sometimes I wanna break down and cry still, but please, please, please....always pay attention while driving. Yes, no serious injuries happened, but it is heart wrenching to know my baby may need surgery to fix her eyes down the road.  She used to be so outgoing before the accident, now she refuses to potty train, (before she was going on the potty) her talking is very minimal, (about 10 words for a 25 month old) and she is afraid to go to new places. Any dr appointment is a break down.  \n\nI just wanted to say that because of something as ridiculous as picking up a phone while driving,  my Eviee is no longer the same. \n\nPlease pay attention to the road while driving. Everything else can wait......really. \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/oDe6r.jpg", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "To the young mother who thought her phone dropping in the car was so much more important than keeping her eyes on the road, totaling my car with my 1 year old and 5 month old......", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/zq57x/to_the_young_mother_who_thought_her_phone/", "user_reports": []}, "comments": [{"archived": true, "author": "MeganKristine", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "My heart breaks for you.

The thousands of things I would change.\n\nBut I can't change them. What's done is done.

I have 3 visits a year and I will never miss a second of my time with him. As he gets older he's going to ask questions. Why him? Why did his babyhood have to suck so damn bad?

He needs me to be a mentally, physically and emotionally healthy mom for him as he grows up. \n\nYou can get past the freshness of the hate and the unfairness, you can live in today and appreciate what you have. I've learned it's true...forgiveness is a gift you give yourself. It's like drinking poison waiting for the other person to die. It doesn't make it right or ok what that woman did. In no way does it make it right. She needs to be punished and hopefully learn. \n\nYour kids and husband need you to be the mom you were before. Not quite as this is a life-changing event.
