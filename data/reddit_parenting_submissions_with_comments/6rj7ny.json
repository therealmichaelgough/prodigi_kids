So I deflected and let it go, but now I'm pretty sure I will have to get him to the doctor without letting him know that he's going for a testicle check as much as I would like to prepare him. I think it is almost guaranteed that he will run on me. I'm almost worried maybe I made him a little suspicious by bringing it up today at all :/\n\n\nI really enjoy your explanations, and am going to take some of your phrasings to heart. You're right, I really have to learn to just be completely firm about this and not let him make any excuses. But I am just dreading the possibility that his fear might overpower him, and seeing him carried into the office kicking and screaming would be an absolute nightmare. Do you think it would honestly be ok for me to have nurses do that if I can't get him inside for some reason?\n\nIf it comes down to the worst case scenario, another commenter said he might end up feeling violated, what could I tell him afterward? I am not the meanest mom in the world, so I feel like he is going to completely hate me if it comes down to it! :( I know I have to be firm, but how can I explain that I had to have people carry him in kicking and screaming and that I let him be strapped down while a doctor touched him in his private parts?? I am REALLY hoping it doesn't come to any of that, but I just feel like I need to have SOMETHING prepared for if it does. I totally get compassion and support, but I am afraid I am new to the tough love kind of firmness that this whole situation requires. Sigh.\n\nDo you think it would help to just reinforce that it's something all boys get done? Would it be better to tell him that I wanted the doctor to check him to make sure he didn't have something extremely wrong? Or do you think it might be better to lie a little bit and suggest that because of school requirements and the doctor pushing for it, and all the other boys having it done, it was kind of out of my control? I realize maybe that's me wanting a little bit of a cop out, but I also feel like maybe he won't see me as so much of a \"bad guy\" who betrayed him if he thinks I was sort of forced into taking him?\n\nI'm sorry if I am sounding a little crazy.

I do it because it's for my health, but that doesn't mean I enjoy it... for someone who has a history of sexual abuse, what is a routinely unpleasant experience for me may be a traumatic event for them because they have a specific sensitivity (mental in this case) to any kind of contact to their genital region.  With any kind of exam to that area - even for someone who doesn't have a specific hang-up about those body parts - there is a small amount of violation that happens.  For a child who has an especially sensitive reaction to even the *idea* of someone coming in contact with his genitals, honestly, feeling violated that Mom is forcing him to be touched there isn't far fetched - it's a reasonable conclusion.  \n\nAnd yes, it is a traumatic word, because based on your description of his past reactions, it seems reasonable that this may be a traumatic experience for him (I'm sorry, keeping it real).  \n\nThe reason I say he may not want to be around friends is because it could cause a level of embarrassment for him - and maybe I'm over-reaching with that theory - I'd let him take the lead on inviting friends over/going out.  \n\nMy explanation to him would be that you and your doctors are very concerned by how sensitive that area is for him and you need to make sure it's not something more that's medically wrong.   This is something that everyone - boy or girl - go through to make sure they are fully healthy... I believe, based on what I've seen for my 5 year old son, that the amount of physical touch during a testicular exam for a child is fairly minimal and really is more about visual inspection than physical manipulation, but *some* touch is necessary.
