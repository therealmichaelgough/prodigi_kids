The nurses treated me like I was a terrible person for having a baby. They offered minimal education and just were short and rude. At the time I didn't really understand that it was about my age, it wasn't until I went to nursing school myself and started working as an LPN at another hospital that I saw how caring, education focused nurses worked with young moms. Yes, teenage mothers are giving their kids a harder chance at life, yes it would usually be better if they didn't have kids that young. But they had them. A huge amount of the issues of teen parenting could be alleviated if they were taught basic parenting skills and *empowered*. \n\nWith my next three children, I was a little older, a nurse, and at the hospital I worked at. The best thing the nurses did there was honoring my wish to have my child with me at all times and giving us a room down the hall so I didn't feel guilty about having my other kids there so much. With one of them, the nurse strongly advocated for me when the on call doctor didn't want to let me leave pp day 2. So I guess, just knowing how to gauge a moms level of understanding and comfort, then educating or advocating based on that. \n\nWith my youngest, she came after almost a decade of me being \"infertile\" and was born at 26+3. She was transferred to a different hospital with a NICU. The best things my pp nurses did in that situation was making sure I was eating/drinking/slowly recovering from the csection so I could be dismissed to go to my daughter. They also coordinated with the NICU lactation nurse to make sure I had all the supplies I needed so I could pump and send tiny syringes of colostrum and milk to the NICU with my partner running it over. The NICU nurses were awesome about calling throughout the day to let me know how she was doing and then making me feel so so so welcome and a part of the care team when I was finally discharged and at the NICU daily.
