The first 2 weeks or so are a grace period before the sleep deprivation kicks in. You're riding on a rush of endorphins, good will, positive attention, helping hands, and parental leave, and you feel almost invincible. When the bottom drops out, it drops out hard. You are expected to be \"on\" 24/7, people lose interest, work resumes, and the baby's needs are relentless. It wears you down quickly. Be prepared: stagger leave so return to work isn't abrupt,  and schedule visits as far out as you can. If people offer to come help, try to get them to come from weeks 5-10, when you'll really be crying your eyes out with exhaustion. Hire help around the house if you can.\n\n2. Breastfeeding hurts like hell, **even when you're doing everything right**. For the first week or so until your nipples desensitize, they will be raw and agonizingly sensitive, no matter how good your positioning or the baby's latch. Nothing made me more pissed off than so-called breastfeeding resources that refused to admit that breastfeeding pain, especially early on, is normal. Edit to clarify: Many resources say, \"Breastfeeding is not painful, period. If it hurts, check for improper latch/position/thrush/mastitis. Here's a bunch of information about latch/position/thrush/mastitis and nothing at all about normal nipple pain because breastfeeding done properly is never ever painful.\" That's it. I understand that they want to minimize fear of bf-ing, and to encourage vigilance about latch issues, but it creates a needless sense of failure or fear for women who are otherwise doing fine. Check in with your doctor, ped, and/or LC regularly, but please keep in mind that it does frickin hurt in the beginning.\n\n4. You need a community of parents! This goes double if you're a stay at home parent. I was completely on my own at home for the first four months. I thought I was going to lose it. I had bad PPA/PPD that was compounded my loneliness and isolation. I have some social anxiety, but I had to power through and start attending mother's groups and baby classes. I made friends, had a routine, got out of the house, and had things to look forward to.  It made me feel SO MUCH BETTER, and my son thrived, too. \n\n3. You will eventually feel 100% like yourself again, and it is glorious. When I got pregnant, everything started changing so fast and so drastically that I mourned that grounded sense of \"self\" that I'd taken for granted. I thought it was gone forever, but just like many other parenting-related challenges, it's happily temporary. Your life will never be the same, but you can reclaim your sense of identity as an autonomous person. For me, it happened about a year out, when my son started regularly sleeping through the night, and improved even more after I weaned at 17 months (probably a lot to do with hormones). Help it along: Don't neglect your physical or emotional health, set some personal goals that have nothing to do with parenting, and take as much time as you can to just be alone or with your partner.", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1471509741, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1471525787.0, "gilded": 0, "id": "d6mdb3s", "link_id": "t3_4y88iy", "parent_id": "t3_4y88iy", "retrieved_on": 1473468932, "score": 13, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"author": "Ur_favourite_psycho", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "This is one of my biggest fears too!", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1471511489, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "d6mdt1t", "link_id": "t3_4y88iy", "parent_id": "t1_d6mat9r", "retrieved_on": 1473469117, "score": 7, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"author": "Britoz", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "What was your relationship like with your mum beforehand?", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1471512409, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "d6me2el", "link_id": "t3_4y88iy", "parent_id": "t1_d6m7yod", "retrieved_on": 1473469212, "score": 4, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"author": "smhockr", "author_flair_css_class": "blue", "author_flair_text": "MommatotheMax", "body": "Postpartum depression can sneak up on you and bring you down without you realizing or recognizing what's happening until you have the worst thoughts, and getting help is not seen as a failure as a parent.

I'll break my answer into two to address each area. \n\nwith the sleep dep - we agreed to work in shifts until Ethan was sleeping a decent amount. my hubby is a night owl and I'm a morning person. we determined we both needed at least 5-6 hours of continuous sleep to be functional, so we broke the 12 hour period between 8pm and 8am into two 6 hour shifts.  I taught myself to go to sleep very early (like 8pm), and my husband would have the \"night shift\" till 2am. then I'd take the monitor and he would sleep from 2-7am. during this time we slept in separate rooms, knowing that this was a temporary setup that would allow us to both get enough sleep. obviously this is harder if you're breastfeeding but I had a decent stash of pumped milk that allowed us to do this until we switched to formula. \n\nwe also kept a strict bedtime and routine for little man. I know this doesn't work for every baby but it worked for us. 8pm, pajamas, diaper, massage, bedtime story and milk. we also, from very early on, put him in bed drowsy but awake. occasionally he would cry, so we'd pick him up until he calmed down, then put him back in the crib. sometimes we had to do this over and over, but he eventually figured it out. it can be exhausting but you're helping your baby learn good sleeping habits, so it's worth it!\n\nI also - after seeing how it affected my sister and bff - said no bed sharing EVER. no matter how tempting it looks at the time, it led them both down the path to over a year of sleep deprivation and less than ideal sleeping habits for their babies. so our little guy was in his own bassinet or crib from day 1. again I know this doesn't work for everyone, but this was a hard line we drew. \n\nthese were our strategies, they won't work for everyone and every baby, but we talked about it a lot beforehand to make sure we had a plan. \n\nI'll address the relationship stuff in a second post, cause it's more complicated lol.", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1471613329, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "d6o0abn", "link_id": "t3_4y88iy", "parent_id": "t1_d6n4cys", "retrieved_on": 1473490357, "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"author": "imperialbeach", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "I don't have a good relationship with my mom.
