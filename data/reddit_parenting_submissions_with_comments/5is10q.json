I stopped for six weeks after I had my son and just recently started going back.  There are 3 doctors at this practice, Dr. O (who I'm pretty sure is the main doctor even though he's practically never there), Dr. P, and Dr. W.  During my pregnancy, I saw Dr. P about 90% of the time and would see Dr. W when he was out of the office.  When I went back, they scheduled me with Dr. W.\n\nWhen I saw her on Tuesday, she asked how my baby was doing.  I said he was fine, but he had just gotten his two month shots that morning so he was a little out of sorts today.  She responded, \"I watched a video once where her mom got her twin boys vaccinated.  It didn't turn out real well.\"  There was an awkward pause and she added, \"They got autism.\"  First of all, I had *just* told her that I had my kid vaccinated.  I can't undo it, what's the point of potentially freaking your patient out?  Secondly, I don't think she should be making comments like that.  If she had said that to someone more impressionable, they could have taken it as advice and not continued getting their kids vaccinated just because she's in the medical field. After that, when I was making my follow up appointments, I asked if I could see Dr. P from now on because he's my preference anyway.  They made a note of it in my file, but asked if I would be okay with seeing Dr. W today because he would be out of the office.  I said that was fine.\n\nWhen I saw her today, I had my son with me.  She asked his name and how old he was.  Then she asked if I was breastfeeding (not needed for anything medical, just asking, so it was kind of a personal question).  I told her that I was supplementing as well because I don't make enough milk (I always feel guilty when people ask me and try to explain even though I shouldn't have to).  My baby started fussing at that moment and she says, \"Oh, that makes him sad!\".  Who even says that??  I'm assuming she doesn't have kids and decides to have them someday so she can be completely embarrassed looking back on the comments she makes.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My chiropractor keeps making really uncalled for comments.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/5is10q/my_chiropractor_keeps_making_really_uncalled_for/"}, "comments": [{"author": "GooseCharmer", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "She sounds terrible at small talk!

But maybe you do know all of that and are a grouchy, defensive chiropractor, so I dunno. Anyway, the point is, it makes reading for bias an exhausting activity regarding the practices of the \"profession\". That also means I'm giving you jumping-off points, not a thesis, because I'm not that redditor. Maybe that redditor will come along and help us all out. Maybe not. If I were you (or anyone else curious about this), I would recommend doing what I've done for a few decades now and seek out balanced, factual research and reports to keep up with the topic.\n\nI'm top-loading with that because the fastest jumping-off point I know of is presented from the side of those who have been injured. It has links to further information, and searches can be done on the names of injured parties and on the elements of the injuries listed: [whatstheharm's article on reported chiropractic injuries](http://whatstheharm.net/chiropractic.html). It includes links to studies, too, which is very convenient.\n\nNote the commonalities in these cases:\n\n1. Chiropractors are much more likely to suggest thoroughly debunked foolishness like homeopathy and anti-vaccination.\n\n2. Chiropractors take advantage of people who are in pain and instead of telling them to go get a more investigative opinion, wasting the time they should have spent getting diagnosed with the actual root cause of their pain. This has led to people being overtreated by chiropractors and undertreated by, for example, oncologists (doctors who treat cancer).\n\n3. Chiropractors have no business treating children, yet many will.\n\nAs you read, you'll note that sometimes a representative for the industry will say something like, \"If someone is perfectly healthy, we don't see a risk with performing neck adjustments so we won't warn them of stroke risk.\" [see 3rd page of [this WebMD article](http://www.webmd.com/stroke/news/20140807/could-chiropractic-manipulation-of-your-neck-trigger-a-stroke)] But that means a lot of people aren't getting the warning, like Katie May (just google her). Bruce Y. Lee posted [this pointed criticism](http://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2016/10/23/model-katie-mays-death-raises-more-questions-about-chiropractors/#4529ff6d12aa) of this common response from allegedly responsible chiropractic practitioners as a result (with links for further research and reference to studies referenced in pretty much all reading you're going to do about chiropractic risk and why it's a serious problem). It's been [identified as an outsized risk for otherwise healthy people for a pretty long while](http://www.ucsf.edu/news/2003/05/4635/chiropractic-treatment-neck-can-be-risk-factor-stroke), so it's weird they're still saying they [wouldn't recommend even the warning](http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/726445) for people they're superficially declaring apparently healthy. This demonstrates several of the issues with using a chiropractor (as detailed throughout this comment).\n\nOne of the problems with evaluating chiropractic risk &amp; actual harm is the inconsistency of data. The only thing that can fix this is for chiropractors to be better data collectors about their practices and the results. If they are truly serious about being health professionals, they can't be afraid of review and analysis (or valid criticism), but this is an ongoing issue with trying to evaluate the outcomes of chiropracty. If they truly feel it's the safest, best treatment for all of the things they say they can treat, then they have a responsibility to collect the data and ask the hard questions. This [Science Based Medicine](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/adverse-effects-of-chiropractic/) article goes into much more detail (and also explains why the risks that have been discovered should be much more emphasized by chiropractors and health professionals who recommend them).\n\nAs to who can do these things better, there are many options. Actual doctors of the spine and pain management centers that pay attention to the whole system in their evaluation and treatment exist. Physical therapists provide pretty much all of the actual useful things a chiropractor can do: TENS application, cold/heat therapy, mobilization (proven safer than manipulation), range of motion exercises, and on and on. Their training specifically includes the soft tissues surrounding the bones and joints and how nerves work. Therapeutic massage can be done by PTs and specifically licensed masseuses. Obviously, one should always practice due diligence in selecting a healthcare provider, so just as one should be doing with a chiropractor, check for appropriate certifications, credentials, memberships, etc. The thing about PTs and massage therapists is that they generally refer a patient back to a primary care physician or will recommend other specialists if they encounter an issue that shouldn't be occurring, isn't improving, or indicates further risk than their techniques can safely treat. This one fact differentiates them drastically from the proven (above) habits of the chiropractic industry. These are as covered by insurance as chiropracty; i.e., it depends on your insurance, there may be some limits to number of appointments, and they should be used in tandem with a primary care physician who is aware of your overall health situation.\n\n\nConclusion: chiropracty is the Scientology of the medical world. Couldn't bring myself to disappoint your desire for sensationalism, so there ya go.\n\nHave fun reading!", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1481991052, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1481991508, "gilded": 0, "id": "dbb5oh7", "link_id": "t3_5is10q", "parent_id": "t1_dbav2cy", "retrieved_on": 1483838292, "score": 11, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"author": "jmurphy42", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "I just lost a very long reply full of citations to a crashed mobile app, and was very grateful to see yours had been posted in the meantime!

It includes links to studies, too, which is very convenient.\n\nOK. We've started with sources pertaining to the discussion at hand. This is one of the worst sources I've seen. There is next to no real data on this page. It's a large list of anecdotal data. You comment about the \"scientific studies\" page, but I suspect you haven't looked at it. Very few of the \"studies\" listed have to do with chiropractic, and the few that do are misrepresented by the caption beneath them. You should go through and actually read the studies they list instead of their captions.\n\n&gt;\"If someone is perfectly healthy, we don't see a risk with performing neck adjustments so we won't warn them of stroke risk.\n\nYou should list the whole quote because the part you omitted is important:\n\n&gt;\"If someone came in from playing basketball and they have a pulled muscle in their neck, but are otherwise perfectly healthy, we don't see a relationship or risk there,\" Overland said. \"The discussion should be based on a thorough examination.\"\n\nThe reason the part you left out is important is because the research that exists demonstrates no causative relationship between stroke and cervical manipulation (I'll list it below). The current hypothetical mechanism of injury of stroke in someone like Katie May, is that she was having a stroke prior to receiving the manipulation. If we know that an otherwise healthy basketball player pulled a muscle during the game, he isn't have a stroke. I'll list most current research on the topic discussing what I just said:\n\nThis study from 2014 assess the amount of force put on the vertebral artery during a chiropractic manipulation:\n\n&gt;The results of this study suggest that vertebral artery strains during head movements including spinal manipulation, do not exceed published failure strains.\n\nhttp://www.clinbiomech.com/article/S0268-0033(14)00249-6/abstract?cc=y=\n\nThat says that the amount of strain put on the vertebral artery doesn't exceed the lowest published minimum force to tear the intima of the vessel.\n\nHere is a systematic review done by the Penn State Department of Neurosurgery in February of 2016, which looked at 253 studies on cervical manipulation and VBA stroke(largest study ever done on the topic). They found:\n\n&gt;There is no convincing evidence to support a causal link between chiropractic manipulation and CAD.\n\nThey went further in the discussion section to say:\n\n&gt;In spite of the very weak data supporting an association between chiropractic neck manipulation and CAD, and even more modest data supporting a causal association, such a relationship is assumed by many clinicians. In fact, this idea seems to enjoy the status of medical dogma. Excellent peer reviewed publications frequently contain statements asserting a causal relationship between cervical manipulation and CAD [4,25,26]. We suggest that physicians should exercise caution in ascribing causation to associations in the absence of adequate and reliable data. Medical history offers many examples of relationships that were initially falsely assumed to be causal [27], and the relationship between CAD and chiropractic neck manipulation may need to be added to this list.\n\nhttp://www.cureus.com/articles/4155-systematic-review-and-meta-analysis-of-chiropractic-care-and-cervical-artery-dissection-no-evidence-for-causation\n\nI'll include a couple huge studies that weren't included in that review (because they hadn't been published by the time it was completed)\n\n1829 stroke patients studied over 3 years.\n\n&gt;We found no significant association between exposure to chiropractic care and the risk of VBA stroke. We conclude that manipulation is an unlikely cause of VBA stroke. The positive association between PCP visits and VBA stroke is most likely due to patient decisions to seek care for the symptoms (headache and neck pain) of arterial dissection.\n\nhttp://chiromt.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12998-015-0063-x\n\n1,157,475 Medicare patients looked at in a massive retrospective cohort. The researchers actually found that the incidence of strokes were higher in people who saw a PCP rather than a chiropractor, but deemed it clinically insignificant:\n\n&gt;Among Medicare B beneficiaries aged 66 to 99 years with neck pain, incidence of vertebrobasilar stroke was extremely low. Small differences in risk between patients who saw a chiropractor and those who saw a primary care physician are probably not clinically significant.\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25596875\n\n\n&gt;Bruce Y. Lee posted [this pointed criticism](http://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2016/10/23/model-katie-mays-death-raises-more-questions-about-chiropractors/#4529ff6d12aa)\n\nThis is a truly terrible article, which is not only written poorly, but with tremendous bias.\n\n&gt;[identified as an outsized risk for otherwise healthy people for a pretty long while](http://www.ucsf.edu/news/2003/05/4635/chiropractic-treatment-neck-can-be-risk-factor-stroke)\n\nThis is a good resource, thank you for listing it, I haven't seen it before. The studies I listed above are more significant in scope, sample and currency, but I appreciate this one. In general, it would be helpful if you linked the actual studies you were referring to so I don't have to go find them. I like to read them myself because many articles (including some of the articles you've listed) misrepresent the studies.\n\n&gt;so it's weird they're still saying they [wouldn't recommend even the warning](http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/726445) for people they're superficially declaring apparently healthy.\n\nYou should take another look at this, specifically the sections I'm about to quote.  Listing a study like this causes me to believe that you don't know how to appraise research:\n\n&gt;Methods: Literature searches in four electronic databases with no restrictions of time or language.\n\nThis means that he was searching all literature ever published in these four data bases, in any language. that means he was searching virtually **all** literature ever done for cases of death d/t chiropractic. What did he find?\n\n&gt;Twenty six fatalities were published in the medical literature\n\n26 case reports in the history of scientific literature in any language. I can't emphasize enough how poor a study this is.\n\n&gt;If they truly feel it's the safest, best treatment for all of the things they say they can treat, then they have a responsibility to collect the data and ask the hard questions. \n\nI agree.\n\n&gt;[Science Based Medicine](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/adverse-effects-of-chiropractic/) \n\nA good, albeit slightly biased article that provides some decent research. Fortunately, a lot of great research has been done over the last several years on the safety of chiropractic (I've listed the largest studies done above) and this article is out of date.\n\n\n&gt;As to who can do these things better, there are many options. Actual doctors of the spine and pain management centers that pay attention to the whole system in their evaluation and treatment exist.\n\nAgain, I was asking for evidence, not your opinion. You've already given your opinion on this in the original post I was responding to.\n\n&gt;[Physical Therapist] training specifically includes the soft tissues surrounding the bones and joints and how nerves work.\n\nA statement like this implying that chiropractors don't receive similar training demonstrates a clear lack of understanding of chiropractic education. You can look at a fairly standard chiropractic curriculum [here](http://catalog.logan.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=10&amp;poid=47&amp;returnto=568#Curriculum_Tables_and_Coursework) at the bottom look for curriculum tables. Huge amounts of anatomy, physiology, and neurology.\n\n\n&gt;The thing about PTs and massage therapists is that they generally refer a patient back to a primary care physician or will recommend other specialists if they encounter an issue that shouldn't be occurring, isn't improving, or indicates further risk than their techniques can safely treat. This one fact differentiates them drastically from the proven (above) habits of the chiropractic industry.\n\nAgain, your opinion.

If you're able to separate the two (as you seem to be), then kudos to you\n\n&gt;Money &amp; influence = overinfluencing by buying studies, lobbying, suppressing negative results, quashing criticism.\n\nMoney/influence can do what you're saying. The problem is, the American Chiropractic Association (ACA), doesn't have nearly the money or influence that you are suggesting. To put this in perspective for you let's compare it to the organization that most frequently opposes chiropractic legislature; The American Medical Association (AMA):\n\nNumber of active licenses for MD's in 2013: 878,194 (from [here](http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20130509/NEWS/305099950))\n\nActive AMA members as of 2013 (most recent stats I could get):\n224,503 (from [here](http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20130509/NEWS/305099950))\n\nChiropractors practicing in the United States from 2014: 45,200 (from [BLS](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/chiropractors.htm))\n\nI couldn't find stats on how many chiropractors are members of the ACA, but let's assume a completely unrealistic number of 100%. If 100% of chiropractors were part of the ACA, that would mean that the has 5 times more lobbying power from membership quantity alone. But that doesn't even include the discussion of money. \n\nThe maximum ACA Membership rate is $660/year, if 100% of practicing chiropractors in the US were members, and all paid the maximum rate that would be slightly less than $30 million. In 2011 the AMA received $37.5 million from membership dues (from [here](http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20120516/MODERNPHYSICIAN/305169961/mp-brief1-ama-membership-nudges-up-after-three-years-of-decline)). So in this situation where I'm being unrealistically optimistic for the ACA, they're at about $8 million less than the AMA. Of course, that doesn't include the approximately $42 million they receive yearly from selling their physician masterfile (from [here](https://www.citizen.org/documents/HL_201211.pdf)) to the pharmaceutical companies for marketing purposes, or other sources related to the use of pharmaceuticals. The ACA has no comparable source of income.\n\nThe AMA has been around for about 120 years longer than the ACA, has more money, more members, a well-known influence on legislation and other allies (like the pharmaceutical industry) which extend its influence further. That's why I was saying that it isn't a real argument. People frequently assert that chiropractors (or their associations) have all this money or influence, when it simply isn't accurate. Chiropractors don't even make much money, compare average compensations for a [chiropractor](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/chiropractors.htm) at $64,440 per year to a [Medical Doctor](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/physicians-and-surgeons.htm#tab-5) $241,273 for primary care. I'm not suggesting that medical doctors shouldn't make more; they should. I'm showing that it's not even *close*.\n\n\nAnyway, like I said before, your opinion is fine.

If it did, they'd be working in a field that actually uses science as a basis for developing treatments\n\n/u/vtlatria is correct here. In fact, chiropractic does use science for developing treatments. For example Cox Flexion-Distraction (F/D) was invented by a chiropractor for treating disc-related issues. It turns out it works well for facet and non-specific low-back pain as well. It's fairly well researched and a more recent therapy. There's also the Mckenzie Diagnosis and Therapy (MDT), which is widely used by chiropractors and has a tremendous amount of research supporting its use for a large variety of things.\n\n[Here](http://www.coxtechnic.com/patients/references) is the research for Cox Flexion-Distraction\n\n[Here](http://www.mckenzieinstitute.org/clinicians/research-and-resources/reference-list) is the research for Mckenzie Diagnosis and Therapy. \n\n&gt;instead of basing treatments on 200 year old quack theories and trying desperately to construct studies in such a way that they'll show their treatments to be effective.\n\nYour comments also imply that chiropractors do nothing but manipulate.

I'm happy that you've read a cochrane review, because I have a lot of respect for cochrane. With that said, they aren't the end-all be-all to every medical treatment. NIH (the people who run PubMed) has a great page detailing what the science says about spinal manipulation [here](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/pain/spinemanipulation.htm#science) and it includes the 2011 cochrane review you're referring to, along with several other reviews. In fact, the section I linked you to is literally titled \"What the Science Says About Spinal Manipulation for Low-Back Pain\"\n\nNIH also has a good page on chiropractic, you can get to it [here](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/chiropractic/introduction.htm#hed5), again I've linked to the \"What the science says\" section for you.\n\nSo there is science supporting chiropractic, you just have to open your eyes and see it.", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1482012593, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "dbbjwkp", "link_id": "t3_5is10q", "parent_id": "t1_dbb6m64", "retrieved_on": 1483845411, "score": 0, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"author": "secretfriend-", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "What an idiot", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1482020951, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "dbbp6yd", "link_id": "t3_5is10q", "parent_id": "t3_5is10q", "retrieved_on": 1483848038, "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"author": "shoopdedoop", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "The one who Poops?", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1482021306, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "dbbpf2a", "link_id": "t3_5is10q", "parent_id": "t1_dbb3lfa", "retrieved_on": 1483848147, "score": 5, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"author": "mleftpeel", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "Friends of mine got their baby \"adjusted\" at 3 days old and asked when we were going to bring our baby to a chiro!

However, as I mention above with issues with the studies, a number of a the data points were people visiting a chiropractor with a stroke in-progress which counted against the profession.\n\nBut if the number of strokes correlated with adjustments concerns you, bear in mind that the malpractice insurance for chiropractors is ridiculously low.
