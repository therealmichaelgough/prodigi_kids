She has also been having difficulty breastfeeding. The lactation consultant in the hospital she was at apparently told her it was normal after a C-section to have a delay with milk coming in but that her colostrum was enough(which coukd be true for some). They also refused to give the baby formula. She grew a bit concerned at how fussy her baby was, but again was told she was fine. Being fussy is normal. A little weight loss is normal. Oh and don't forget to just keep latching and do not use any formula. \n\nThe next day they discharged them to go home. She said she was still struggling with feeding and felt baby was getting enough, but carried on since everyone told her it was normal and fine. That night they went to the ER with a floppy baby and discovered she was extremely dehydrated. The ER doc started her on formula right away and immediately asked for where she eas discharged from and said they needed to file a complaint. \n\nThe baby is completely fine but I cannot stop thinking about the whole situation. My heart breaks that she now has the memory of seeing her daughter like that. \n\nAt what point do we stop and recognize there might just be a toxic mindset around \"baby friendly\" hospitals, or at least certain staff. I even got side eyed from an LC when I signed to have my baby supplemented; \"you know breastmilk is better.\" \"I'm pretty sure fed is better than nothing if I'm having issues, thanks.\" Why do these lactation consultants seem to always be rude and dismissive?

He would unlatch soon after they left the room so I just continued to let him latch poorly resulting in really cracked nipples to the point where I dreaded every feed :-( Lactation consultant came in the day after birth, proceeded to try and shove the boob in babys mouth aswell and got frustrated with him when he cried and wouldnt latch, like wtf lady. She gave up after literally 2 tries and just put on a breastfeeding video for me to watch and left the room. Video was of perfectly calm babies latching on in 2 secs.. umm ok.. my son definitely was not going to calmly latch like these video babies but alrigghhttyyy then. A few days of absolute fresh hell at home with baby I did some online research of my own and sent my SO and dad out to buy formula because my baby was losing weight and quite jaundiced. After a couple days of formula feeding and pumping we dropped the formula and exclusively pumped for 2 weeks until my nipples healed enough. There was an immediate change is babys temperament as soon as we gave him his first bottle of formula- he stopped crying all the time and became so calm and relaxed- my poor son was just really hungry :-(. I really wanted to EBF though so started baby back on the breast at about 3 weeks old and here we are at 3 months full time EBF and getting chubbier by the day. Even after 2 weeks there was no nipple confusion and I think the bottle even helped baby learn to latch better (Dr Brown teats worked for us).\n\nBottom line of my unintentionally long story, I agree that these so called professionals can be completely trash when it comes to FTMs- good old google and the appropriate reddit threads did soooo much more for me.
