I went in to labour. It was fast and hard. I did change my mind for an epidural.  But i still feel that I was pushed into it by the staff. My first was fast and intense. No one was listening to me, I was unable to be assertive as I was focusing on the contractions. The doctor rolled her eyes at me. They refused to get me water and I had to go into the bathroom and drink from the tap. They had me sign for an epidurial AFTER it was placed, had already called the anistheologist even though I said No. When he got there I felt I had to have it done since he was there and they were all making a huge deal about it. He also gave me some sort of shot in my iv to get me to sit still. I had my daughter an hour and a half later. She was also a very sleepy baby the first few days and I was very sore the first 3 weeks.\n\nSecond baby was also intense. I had a midwife, but was transferred to an obgyn to have an induction due to IUGR. I demanded a different hospital this time. I chose the form of induction (cervadil tab when they wanted pitocin and a prostaglandin gel). I chose to not have an IV. I was informed every step of the way. Even though it was not my original plan. It went quick and was quite painful. But her placenta was detaching and that is painful on its own on top of the contractions. But we got through it. Still did not need an IV or pain meds. Second daughter was alert afterwards, ate well, and I felt great after 2 days. Seriously everyone kept telling me to take it easy. It felt like just a deep work out. They kept trying to give me a prescription for t3's and kept telling me I did not have to be brave for the pain afterwards. I had only requested an ibuprofen the next day due to a headache. That was all. It was crazy. I refused the prescription but they snuck it in my bag with al the info packets from the hospital!  They did not believe that I was feeling fine. I felt no after pains or cramps and just a little sore. \n\nIts interesting cause my cousin also had an epi with her first. Went with a midwife for hee second cause it was cheaper (she had moved from Canada to the US) she fully expected to get pain meds. Ended up happening so quickly she did it naturally at home.

Sometimes babies aren't facing the right way and it makes it way more painful. Sometimes they get stuck, sometimes the mom gets back labor. Some women have higher pain tolerances than others. Sometimes labor lasts for so long that you just need a way to rest so that you will have the strength to push when the time comes.

My OB was not there when I went into labor, my husband didn't bother checking out how to help me, my MIL was encouraging but didn't know what to do, and the nurse didn't want to help me. She bullied me into staying in bed when I wanted out, into consenting to having my water broken, and then into the epidural. I am at peace with the situation now, since I can't change it, but it was really upsetting for a long time. I had not really prepared myself for a fight bc I thought the nurse would want to help me, and that's not what happened. I labored for 8 hours without anything, and got to 7cm before the epi. It took me 3.5 hrs to dilate 3cm and I pushed for 30 minutes. \n\nFor my second birth, I found a friend who had a natural birth and was interested in helping me with this birth. I accepted that my husband wasn't going to ever be an efficient partner for me, so she and I talked about everything. When my water broke, she met us at the hospital. She helped rub and push on my belly (very weird, I've never met anyone who wanted their baby pushed on while in labor), sat next to me while I was in the tub, and held my had when I pushed. When I tried to squat and ended up sobbing that I wanted drugs, she helped me up and comforted me that I could have them if I held out just a few more minutes. 20 minutes later, I had a baby, lol. It was a million times easier to deal with the nurse and doctor with her by my side. From the time I got to the hospital to baby being born, it was only 4 hours. \n\nMy third baby, I had at a birth center with the same friend again. When I found out I wasn't dilating after 12 hours of my water breaking, she helped me lunge up and down the halls and bounce on a birth ball. When I was stuck in the bathroom dealing with side effects of castor oil, she brought me water, put a wash rag on my head, and then closed the door for privacy. I finally dilated enough to get in the tub to deliver, and she held my hand during contractions and pet my hair. After the baby was born (and named after her &lt;3), she held her skin to skin while my husband helped me in the bathroom.\n\nSo what I'm saying is, you need a good partner. Whether that's your boyfriend/husband or a friend who is really into natural birth or a hired doula. My husband is super supportive, but needs directions detailed to him and I can't do that in labor. My friend intuitively knows things that help, and can read my responses even when it was things like a single \"ehh\".

I started walking during contractions, did a lot of the comforting techniques that they mention in [\"The Birth Partner\"](http://www.amazon.com/The-Birth-Partner-Third-Edition/dp/1558323570) - which worked!  \n\nIt's like a really bad cramp.  The worst part about it is that not only does it get harder, but it's going to happen again.  And again. And again.  The anticipation for the next round is what got to me.  Breathing techniques are awesome (Hoo! Hee! Haaa!), and you can deal with the pain, but it's a bitch.\n\nWhat got me to change my mind was that at my week-overdue appointment my midwife broke my water, which lead to immediate referral to the hospital/birthing center, and because my water broke they would only give me 24 hours to labor - so, petocin. Petocin makes your cramp/labor pains go from ughhh to GAAA!!! It ups not only the intensity but the frequency.  Sometimes I wouldn't have more than 2 seconds between contractions.\n\nThe water bath really helps, if you're going natural, but it slows the labor.  It's a good breather. Having my husband lean his thumbs into my back with all his might (he had sore thumbs for a week after and I had bruises) was awesome.  But the episodic persistence over a day and a half (I started laboring the night before) wore me down.  I'm pretty tough - backcountry park ranger, field biologist.  I kept telling jokes between contractions.  But it's like water torture.\n\nAt around 30 hours of labor (18 or so with petocin), I begged for an epidural.  The worst part of that isn't the needle, it's the fact that your legs basically don't exist.  It's really tough to turn or move at all, and the numbness is spotty over time.\n\nThey let me extend my labor beyond the 24 hours after my water broke by 4 hours or so - I could feel her pressing against my pelvis, like sitting on a bicycle seat sideways - but eventually we decided on a c-section. Dammit.\n\nRemember how I said that the epidural was spotty?  It numbed my skin, but not my insides.  I felt the c-secion, as if I were being eviscerated.
