He's works 230pm to 1230am, and has for nine years. My son is also almost nine. Our daughter is 3.\n\nFor nine years I have gotten up with the kids and put the kids to bed. I drop the kids off at school/sitters and pick them up. I make them dinner, I clean up after them, I take them to their extra curriculars, I make all their appointments. Not to mention that I do 75% of the house work. All while I work part time as well.\n\nMy husband goes to bed around 3am so he only gets up with a few hours in between to shower and stuff. Weekends? Well he's still on his schedule so he still sleeps until 11 (I get up with the kids and still also put them to bed).\n\nYesterday I had a breakdown because a project I was working on fell through. Why? Because I get hardly any kid-free time. I got mad. He got mad that I was mad. It's like I'm not allowed to dislike the situation because he's \"bringing home the bacon.\" But am I about to get a full time job with a schedule like that? Hell no. I'm stressed enough.\n\nI know it's not entirely his choice. I do try and empathise; I'm grateful for him. He's a good father. But I am really frustrated. I just needed to vent. I don't feel like I can talk to anyone about this.

Not to mention the part time work. Move over wonder woman, Mrs BeanMagician is here.   \n\n\nI certainly sympathize with feeling like you're doing everything. My husband works a similar shift and much of the kid stuff falls to me (I get overwhelmed and we only have one and she's only 3 months). But he has tweaked his day so that he can be as involved as possible now that he's a dad. His shift is 330-12, and he is usually home by 1230. He goes to sleep by 1 because he doesn't sleep in all morning. I wake up early with our daughter, but he's up by 830-9 usually so that he can either go to his second job or help around the house/be an active participant in our family's life. On \"days off\" from his main job, he goes to bed with me (11-1130) and wakes up with me (6 or so) and our daughter (and on these days he works his second job). Sometimes he wakes up and takes care of her so that I can sleep in a bit and he can bond with her more. He also works a second job most mornings, so 4 days per week I'm really running the show solo. I completely sympathize with feeling alone and overwhelmed-- though I don't have nearly a decade of it under my belt. That sounds exhausting. It seems like there are steps your husband can take that could absolutely help even this playing field.  \n\n\nFor one, why is your husband staying up so late? My husband used to stay up late to \"wind down\" pre-baby, but now he listens to meditations or classical music on the drive home so that he can relax/zen out and be ready for sleep when he gets home. And he doesn't sleep in late just because he couldn't sleep the night before-- that perpetuates a later sleep cycle. And since you husbands works 10s, does he get 3 days off? If so, that's even more a reason for him not to be sleeping until 11am . Goodness. If that's the case, almost half his week he could have a normal family life-- why isn't he choosing that?  \n\n\nIt sounds like y'all need to have a talk when you're both in a good mood/the kids aren't around. Don't be afraid to be vulnerable-- tell him you feel overwhelmed, that you're exhausted and need his help. And suggest he tweak his schedule a bit to better accommodate \\*your\\* needs, as you've certainly switched yours around to fit his.

If he stays up until 12am on his days off because of his schedule, then why isn\u2019t he putting the kids to bed? I get why you have to get up with the kids but what is the reasoning you have to put them to bed on his nights off if he\u2019s up. \n\nHe works 10 hours a day. He has 14 hours a day off. 14 whole hours. And it sounds like he\u2019s not spending them on the house/kids. If he sleeps for 8 he\u2019s got 6 hours a day of \u201chim\u201d time. \n\nLet me give some examples of things he could do. Before going to work at 2:30pm, he could put something in the crock pot when he gets up at 12pm for 6 hours. Many crock recipes are 4-6 hours and you could have a meal for you and the kids when you get home. He could go grocery shopping. \n\nIf you had a busy day for a project, he could sleep from 1am to 7am and bring the kids to school. Many people, especially moms, live on 6 hours of sleep every night or less. He could do this once a month when you\u2019re really busy and even probably nap before going in if he\u2019s just getting up in PJs to drop the kids off. \n\nI\u2019m a nurse. I work 12 hour shifts that are actually 13 hours. If I have time to put a meal in a crock pot when I get home, go to the grocery before work, walk the dog, etc there\u2019s no reason he can\u2019t help with the house more. \n\nI just want you to know that it feels like an excuse to you because I think his schedule is an excuse. And I think if he worked 8am to 6pm, it would be no different. He\u2019d still find a reason not to cook, not to bring the kids to school, etc. Society makes excuses for men and it falls on the moms. I\u2019m sorry to say it. \n\nThis does not mean he doesn\u2019t care about you or the kids. It means he\u2019s complacent and likely happy with the arrangement. He\u2019s never had to do better than this, more has never been expected of him. Please sit down with him and talk and compare schedules and responsibilities. He may not really realize what he\u2019s capable of or how much you\u2019re doing alone. \n\nI know you\u2019re not in any way discussing divorce, but if you divorced, how could he be a parent without you? I wonder if he\u2019s ever thought of that. He\u2019d have no way to get the kids to and from school by his current standard. I bet he\u2019d make it work if he had to. Just like you have to now.
