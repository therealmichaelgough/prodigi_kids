I want to travel, but every time I do, I feel like it's detracting away from what I actually want. I'd ask my mom what she thinks, but she died when I was 6 and she was 33.

I had six kids over the next nine years. After twelve years of marriage, I got divorced and coparent with my ex-husband and my new husband; we are all very close and maintain bonds as a family. The children live with my husband and me, but see their father every day (except for right now, as he is in another state wrapping up a business venture, but other than this, he's never been away from them, and we agreed to live within a mile of each other so that we always have access to the children). \n\nI am now 31 weeks pregnant with my seventh child, my first with my new husband; I'm 35 and a half. \n\nWith regard to the physical aspects-- being younger was a million times better. Pregnancy at 35 sucks so much. I remember when I was pregnant with my first, I was painting the living room at 35 weeks. Right now, a trip to the grocery store is too much for me. But this varies widely from woman to woman, so many other older moms have much different experiences than I do. \n\nWith regard to emotional/psychological/social impact on my life, I'm definitely much more patient and knowledgeable now than I was when I got married, but I was definitely an enthusiastic, hands-on, deeply attached parent. Because I was so young, I had a lot of energy to be really, really involved in every aspect of my older children's day. My oldest son's first sentence was \"Go away mom\" because I was constantly up in his grill, trying to make sure he knew the alphabet by the time he was one, and freaking out about every developmental milestone. I'm much, much more laid back now. \n\nFinancially, I have a lot more money now than I did when I had my first son. Financial worry comprised a huge portion of my stress in the first four years of parenthood for me. \n\nOne of the benefits of starting young, for me, is that I've done a lot of things in my thirties, now that my older kids are teenagers, that most women do in their twenties. So I didn't really miss out; I just did things in a different order, or, in the case of getting my masters, much more slowly and later. I never would have expected to be divorced and remarrying at 33, but now that I'm 35 and expecting a child with two teenagers, two preteens and two school aged kids, it's really fun and fascinating to watch them get so excited about a new sibling. \n\nAll that to say, no matter how you plan, it may not turn out as you expected, but if you're doing your best and pursuing what you think is best and making responsible choices, you probably won't have regret. \n\nAlso, having a baby, especially just one, does not need to curtail travel. We take our kids with us, and we start taking them to restaurants, theater, and live events at birth-- they quickly learn by example how to behave in a well-mannered way and enjoy adventure.

We are very financially stable and have a nice home. That being said, I agree with you that having a child young is nice when you have the energy, but the first week we had our son was so unbelievably difficult, I was so grateful for our years of infertility (I know that sounds bad) and the travel we had done. I love our son, but transition to mommyhood was SO much harder than I thought,  especially since we waited so long for him to come into our lives. In the years before though  We took a lot of amazing trips while we tried to get pregnant and those memories, the bonding time with my partner, I am so happy we were able to do that before our baby changed everything. So, you're right that as long as you're financially stable, independent, and in a happy and committed relationship there's no ideal age, but if you want to travel I think it's important to do that now, Im really happy we did before baby.

We were broke but we knew we wanted to have as much time (years/future) as we could with our kids and that we would find ways to make it work. We are glad we didn't wait. When my oldest (now 4) was just 6mo old, my husband started suffering from an intestinal infection that lasted for months and left damage and pain. Then he survived a heart attack (genetic cholesterol disorder that we were unaware of since he was active and fit) when my youngest (now 3) was about 6mo old. We are still broke most of the time but get by. We wouldn't change anything about when we had our kids though. What if the heart attack scared us off of having kids? Or we decided it was going to be too much for us after that? Yes one now has the cholesterol disorder but we are well aware and can monitor and manage it.

I will say this -- among my friends (late 20s, early 30s, college educated, professionals), a few of us have kids and none of us regretted waiting until after our early/mid-20s. In fact, having my LO at 28, I kinda wish I had waited until 30 or so.

But, there are times that make it easier -- DH told me that he wanted us to have a three-digit income before we had a kid (which is NOT necessary and may be out of reach for some, but we live in a high cost-of-living area) and I'm glad we waited until that point. I also agree with the person who says that being married is ideal -- there's just a bit more stability that's really important at the beginning when you're loving/resenting your partner. \n\nIf you have a strong support system and good finances, then traveling after kids isn't out of the question. We rented a house in the Outer Banks for a week in 2015 with kid (OK, domestic travel might not be what you're referring to) and are going to Jamaica sans kid this July. Sure, it's not Europe -- but I think we'll get there once he's a little older. \n\nWe still have a life. Don't let people tell you that your life ends when you have kids.

Having a baby, even the easiest best sleeping baby ever born, is incredibly stressful on your relationship. There's a reason why they recently published a research article stating that the first year of your baby's life is often your most unhappiest.  \nMake sure you have someone by your side that's going to stick with you even when shit gets REALLY real. Also, is your partner someone that willingly helps with housework?  Cooks?  You're going to need him to step up and do both. \n\nWhy am I most happy I waited?!  Because we are financially stable.

These aren't trips we've saved years for, these are just our two big trips for the year.  Next year we're talking about doing a month long tour of the west coast. \nAre these things necessary to raise a happy, healthy child?  Absolutely not. But I can attest that it makes everything a lot freaking easier. \n\nLast, everyone who had kids young is right: you'll have more energy and you'll be able to travel in your 40's. Unfortunately, you're giving up the spontaneous things that make your childless 20's so fun: closing down a bar/restaurant with friends, staying up all night for any reason, piling a bunch of people in the car and taking a trip somewhere and staying in a cheap motel (trust me, shitty mattresses and bad backs become a thing in the future.) basically, you'll absolutely have your freedom in your 40's but you'll still be a parent and you'll still have your responsibilities.

I just want to reiterate a couple of things:\n\n1) Rock solid relationship. Soooooo important. I've seen so many break apart when a baby comes, even for people that have been married for 5+ years. Basically, if there's ANYTHING about him at all that irks you (and vice versa), it needs to be completely addressed. He's always leaving his dirty laundry on the floor and you resent him just a teeny bit for it? But you've been dealing with it for years and think it's no big deal? It'll blow up. I recommend marriage too, but more importantly really getting the hang of living together and doing things as a couple, to the point where it's as natural as just living by yourself. Only then can you add other family members. I only have a toddler right now, she was born on our second wedding anniversary. We dated for 5 years prior to that, and were friends for 2 years before dating. I knew him inside and out, and definitely worked hard to get to a point where I was completely comfortable living with him. I think the baby brought us together even more because we were already so in synch, but I can totally see how fragile it could make a relationship.\n\n2) Financial stability. No matter how well off you think you are, it's not enough with a kid. Let alone 4 kids. We're supposed to be quite well off, we both earn $100k+. Let me tell you, it does not feel that way at all. Running a house with kids can be insanely expensive. After mortgage, bills, cars, insurance, daycare, kids things etc that need constant updating, we barely have any to put away for a rainy day, or for big projects like finishing the basement. As your kids grow up, they'll have extracurricular activities that cost more money. Multiply that by multiple kids. I know a lot of kids grow up without all the extras, and most people with a lot lower income can manage, but my point is simply to be aware of all the extra expenses that are here to stay, and it will add strain to what you thought was a good financial situation.\n\nA little addendum. Health-wise, I was 31. I had a completely worry free pregnancy. Except for tiredness and loss of appetite at the beginning, I felt great all the way through. I won't go into details, but I had a c-section and recovery was a bitch. I'm left with problems in my knees (from overuse because my abs hurt like hell for a month), a mushroom-like body, extra fat that won't go away, also haven't been able to exercise for the longest time. My uterus still hurts on occasion. I think that if I were younger, the physical part could've been a lot easier. But overall I'm glad I was where I was - in my relationship, my education/career, the amount of $ I was bringing home, etc. I couldn't have been able to deal with a baby if any of those was compromised.\n\nAll this is just personal experience and opinion. I know people who are in a lot less ideal situations with kids that thrive. I just wouldn't be able to myself.

You're as fit and healthy as you want to be. I'm in my 40s with young kids, and I'm fitter than I've ever been. Age only slows people down when they get complacent about their health and fitness (or if they lose the genetic lottery).\n\n&gt; So mommies of Reddit, when did you have your kids and how did it turn out? I'll answer any questions you may have if that I'll help give you advice.\n\nI'm a proponent of waiting a bit to have kids, not necessarily as late as I did (I didn't meet my husband until I was 30) but at least until you've gotten a degree, had a bit of a career, and traveled internationally a few times. Lots of people who have kids young say \"I can travel when my kids are out of the house. I'll still be young enough to enjoy it.\" The thing is, though, that that often just doesn't happen, and when it does it's a totally different type of traveling that isn't half as adventurous. In addition, you're not anywhere near as decrepit in your 40s and 50s as you assume you'll be when you're younger, so there's no reason you can't travel both before and after having kids.\n\nI had my kids in my late 30s, and I honestly feel like if I died tomorrow, I would die content that I've lived a full and complete life. I've not only travelled but also lived in other countries, I've received a great education in a STEM field and have worked on really interesting projects that have taken me to incredible places. Now I have kids, and the foundation that my husband and I have set through our educations and careers allows us to travel internationally with our children every year (which is just as valuable to our children's education as any of the rest of their schooling). I eat healthy and take care of myself by running marathons, and this also teaches my children the importance of health and fitness.\n\nThere are lots of other very good ways to live your life, but I can definitely say, without a doubt, that the path my life has taken is good one, and I think my kids benefit from it as well. I'm definitely a far better parent to them than I could have been in my 20s, as I have become wiser in ways that wouldn't have occurred to me then and also have infinitely more patience. Life is good, and parenting is a breeze. Maybe I just got lucky with my kids, but I can't help but wonder if the ease of parenting has something to do with my age.", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1453597926, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "cz9j3rq", "link_id": "t3_42bari", "parent_id": "t3_42bari", "retrieved_on": 1454688116, "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"author": "Chocobean", "author_flair_css_class": "lightcoral", "author_flair_text": "mom of a happy toddler", "body": "You sound very thoughtful :) you will be great. \n\nYou heard correctly that there is no perfect time: I will amend it slightly.

That said, my general advice is to take things as they come.  You may respond to motherhood differently than you think- and you don't want to feel trapped in anything.\n\nI grew up the oldest grand-daughter in a large religious family, so I had been babysitting all my life, with a few summers under my belt as a live-in nanny to infants.  I was certain I would want a lot of kids, I would breastfeed them, and I would stay home with them (as least most of the time).  After I got married (just after turning 22), I decided to set up financial stability and get away from my abusive family before we had kids.  Then I found I really loved working and I loved having money and taking trips to Adults Only resorts and generally spending time with my husband.  After being married 5 years, we were both longing for a child and had a son.  By this point, I had reduced my ideal to 2 - 3 kids, but after having my son, I discovered that I really missed my job and was counting the days to the end of my maternity leave to get back to it.  I love my son and I am discovering what motherhood means to me more each day- but I at this point I don't know if I will have any more kids.  Ironically, my best friend who thought she might never want kids ended up leaving her job and feeling very fulfilled as a stay-at-home mom.  So you don't know for sure how you will actually feel.\n\nOne of the best reasons for waiting the 5 years to have kids was that our marriage (and bank account) was able to weather the storm of having a child that did not sleep for 1.5 years.

All the bad stuff (the sick nights, the doctor/hospital visits, the explosive diapers, the sleeplessness, etc.) are greatly overshadowed by the good things (the cuddles, the unconditional love they give, watching them learn and grow, watching them succeed, all of their many firsts).\n\nHowever, while your first priority will and should always be your kids, you cannot neglect yourself.  When the kid hasn't slept in days, take turns with your partner so you each get SOME sleep, even if it means kicking each other to a family member's or friend's house for a few hours or overnight to catch up on some sleep.  Your days of going out alone or as a couple may be much more limited, but they are no less important.  You'll both still need that time out with your friends and with each other to just decompress and have fun.\n\nIf becoming a mom is calling for you, then talk about it.

That being said, it's really up to you when you feel like you are ready.  The only thing I would caution is that you mention you have a boyfriend of 3 years.  Kids are a lifetime commitment.

If both of you are not mentally in a position to be ready to get married, you are both probably not in a mental position to be ready for children.

The thing is, when you're older, the last thing you want is a group of drunk 20-somethings stumbling into your hostel dorm, waking you up at stupid o'clock in the morning, so you stay in private rooms or proper hotels. You stick together with your husband/wife, and while you certainly have a good time, it's more private time doing planned activities. When you're in your 20s, even if you're not one of those stumbling in drunk, your dorm-mates are the people you end up befriending along your journey and have impromptu side adventures with.
