So the cat doesn\u2019t snuggle up with me as much anymore. Made me worry bc I know people who fear they won\u2019t love the second child as much as the first, but then they do once the second baby is born. But in this case I don\u2019t feel the same for my cat as I once did. Baby boy is only 7 weeks so still very dependent and takes up all of my time right now so maybe things will eventually change.
