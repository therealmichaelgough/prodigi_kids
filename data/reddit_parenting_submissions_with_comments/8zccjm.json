She gave me two pieces of advice as a working mom : 1) when you get home, make that time 100&amp;#37; about your kids. 2) Babies and little kids don't need their parents around as much as pre-teens and teenagers do. My mom went from full-time to part time when I was \\~14 years old (I was the oldest) and even if that's not possible, alot of times careers become more flexible the longer you're in them (As you get higher up, position-wise), so it's easier to take an afternoon off to go watch a sports game or attend some mid-day school event.

They are trained in early child development and know more about it than I do. I learn from them and so do my kids.
