And even though the thimersol is in the flu vaccine, this vaccine is used worldwide - but the USA still has one of the highest rates of autism in the world: if thimersol is causing autism, why are other countries not reporting it in such high numbers? I don't know! Maybe their doctors aren't as good at diagnosing autism? Maybe they have different cultural norms where autism is not as accepted, so kids with autism are hidden away like those with mental or social problems used to be! OR, maybe vaccines have nothing to do with autism, something else is causing it, and doctors are just [getting better at diagnosing it, or broadened the criteria (which they DID in 1994)](http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/the-increase-in-autism-diagnoses-two-hypotheses/) (and more accepting of it) in the U.S., which results in what looks like an \"increase\" of autism.\n\nAnd yeah, that website has lots of hilarious correlations - have a look! \n\nAll I'm saying is that if you want to cite scientific studies to support your point, make sure that they are actually showing *causation* rather than just correlation.

Observational studies are those that look at vaccinated vs unvaccinated kids and then look at whether or not they have ASD  (and determine whether or not there is a causation). An experimental study would involve getting a group of thousands of children (because you need large numbers for studies to be properly accurate) and randomly giving some of them vaccines and some not, then monitoring them over the course of their life to see if they develop ASD. How many parents do you think would be open to putting their children into a study like this? Would you let your child participate? Particularly because the vast majority of doctors believe vaccinating to be the safe and responsible choice, I would suspect that scientific bodies would consider a study like this to be unethical, as it would leave many children unvaccinated, which the medical community currently believes to be a huge risk.\n\nSecond, what are you looking for in terms of a \"Double-blind placebo controlled study comparing any licensed vaccine to a saline solution\"? [This study](http://www.fda.gov/downloads/BiologicsBloodVaccines/Vaccines/ApprovedProducts/UCM329134.pdf) at page 3 and 4 (a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study) considered the number of adverse reactions to the influenza vaccine vs a saline solution. Table 1 shows that there were not very many differences in terms of \"reactions\" between those who had the vaccine, and those who received a placebo. Serious adverse reactions to vaccines are very, very rare.\n\nI have searched for a study comparing overall health outcomes between vaccinated and unvaccinated children, and cannot find any on reputable news or scientific websites, only ones on \"natural health\" (naturalnews.com) and \"anti vax\" websites (vactruth.com). I have found studies by anti-vax groups and lobbies such as the Immunisation Awareness Society, but no studies by groups that do not have an anti-vax agenda. If you can find me a study showing overall health outcomes between vaccinated and unvaccinated children from a website or group that is not already anti vax (i.e. an actual scientific study), I will look at it. The problem with studies that are performed and/or funded by anti-vax groups is that they are already trying to prove that agenda. A study performed by a non anti vaxxer that found that vaccines were harmful, now *that* I would be inclined to look at.

Nearly all recovered in a few days without serious consequences.  At the same time 1 in 68 American children were diagnosed with autism or for every case of measles there were 7000 cases of autism.  I ask myself which is the real epidemic here?\n\nI'm sure you can agree that the 'epidemic' of autism is not really comparable to measles: measles can kill, while autism (though difficult) can not. My younger brother, who had autism (and has since passed away from an unrelated unexpected death), was extremely difficult and challenging to care for: despite having witnessed a very severe case of autism first hand, I am not worried at all if my daughter (or any future children) are diagnosed with the same. Autism is a social disorder that many parents, unfortunately, are embarrassed to admit their child has. This is sad. It upsets me that people consider the chance of autism a potential reason not to vaccinate (even though there no real evidence that vaccinations cause autism). Measles, on the other hand, is something that can cause very real harm and death to an individual. I would take an autistic child any day than have my child catch measles.\n\nThis doctor, Michael W Elice, also cites the study that showed a \"340% increase in autism in African-American boys in Chicago\". As I mentioned previously, this study has been retracted, and there are serious doubts as to its methods. I'm not inclined to trust Dr Elice's opinion on this matter when he is using outdated information on a study that is not seen by the scientific community as reputable.\n\nI'm also not sure why he states that the risk of dying from measles is nearly zero, as that is an unfair way to quantify the harm that can come from measles - remember that death is not the only 'result' of measles (it can result in blindness, encephalitis (an infection that causes brain swelling), severe diarrhoea and related dehydration, ear infections, or severe respiratory infections such as pneumonia). \n\nAnyway, I am 98% sure that there is nothing I can say that can convince you to change your mind. I try to keep an open mind and have read numerous anti-vaccination websites. I have a 3 month old baby: I breastfeed, I eat organic food, I babywear, I'm VEGAN for goodness sake. I don't take antibiotics unless I am very, very sick (because antibiotic resistance is dangerous), I take natural supplements... I'm not exactly NOT 'crunchy'. But from all the evidence that I have read on vaccination, I cannot believe that vaccinations are simply some kind of conspiracy among pharmaceutical companies to make money. Yes, vaccines have risks. Yes, vaccines are not 100% effective. But, like scientists who discuss climate change, the vast, vast majority of doctors support vaccination and believe it to be one of the greatest medical developments in modern history. I'm not sure if you are a climate change skeptic as well, but if you DO believe in man made climate change, why would you listen to the 97% of scientists who support man made climate change theories, but not listen to the 97% of doctors who support vaccination?\n\n\nAs I said, I don't believe I can change your mind. I'm from New Zealand, where the anti-vaccination movement is significantly smaller. Anti-vaxxers here are just viewed as pretty much ignorant kooks. But in the U.S., anti-vaxxers are everywhere it seems!! It just astounds me, from a cultural perspective. I feel like Americans feel the need to challenge scientific data constantly - whereas I have never had any reason not to trust my doctor: we have highly subsidized healthcare here. My prescriptions never cost more than $5. My daughter's doctors visits are free. Her prescriptions are free. Her vaccinations are free. My doctors visits cost me $30 per visit. When I was a child, my vaccinations were free. While I was pregnant, they were free. My 3-day hospital stay when I gave birth was free. My husband's broken toe casts and treatment were all free. I do not have health insurance, because I don't need it here. So... I have no reason to see a profit motive behind vaccines. There's no money to be lost except when our government pays for all our treatments, our vaccines, the medical equipment in our hospitals. All the governments in the world that support and implement free and subsidized healthcare for their populations ... why would they pay for vaccines and other medical resources if it was all a sham? I think the governments of the world, if anyone, would have access to all the 'secret conspiracy' information that is being supposedly 'hidden' from us.\n", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1423176490, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "cochi9c", "link_id": "t3_2uptp9", "parent_id": "t1_cocdg2j", "retrieved_on": 1424147804, "score": 2, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"archived": false, "author": "throwawayunvaxxer", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "For the record, I cringed at that sentence too. As I've said many times, autism is the least of my worries. And thank you for acknowledging that there is a risk. It is simply not appropriate for me to tell other parents what risks they need to take for my comfort, and I will not stand for it when they do it to me. \n\nI'm not a climate change denier. I can see it happening with my own eyes. My experience informs my opinion on that subject, and the lifestyle decisions we make as a result. I also don't think scientists have anything to gain regarding climate change. But I do think there is a lot of money in vaccines and the medical industry, and that industry funds the science. It funds the studies that say vaccines are safe. I don't trust it. I never will. \n\nMy question for you is - do you really think that all these parents reporting that their kids \"went away\" and never talked again after their vaccinations are lying? It's just coincidence? I've talked to hundreds of these heart broken mothers. \n\nYou can't change my mind. You're right. If nothing else, I will lean upon my own experience and what I see with my own eyes. My children are healthier then their peers. I'm seriously not saying that to be a superior asshole or to brag. Their fully vaxxed peers are constantly down with colds, ear infections, flus, UTIs. My kids - and the other unvaxxed ones I know - shake everything off within a day or two. That's not to say I don't know perfectly healthy vaxxed kids. But I see a difference in the unvaxxed ones. \n\nAs that article said - it's the terrain, not the disease. I believe vaccines pollute the terrain, sometimes in minor ways and sometimes in massive ways. We've done humanity a HUGE disservice by abusing this technology. You cannot sanitize the world. \n\n&gt;Despite the fact that the biological basis of naturally acquired immunity is not understood, present day medical practices insist upon artificial manipulation of the immune response (a.k.a. immunization or vaccination) to secure \"immunity\" without going through the actual disease process. The vaccine-induced process, although not resembling a natural disease, is nevertheless still a disease process with its own risks. And it is not immunity that we gain via vaccination but a puny surrogate of immunity. For this reason, vaccination at its core is neither a safe nor an effective method of disease prevention. Yet, immunologists have nothing better to offer because they can only go as far as their deeply rooted immunologic dogma allows them. - Dr. Tetyana Obukhanych\n\nI believe the medical industry, at its core, is invested in creating patients. I believe that most doctors mean well and believe they are doing the right thing. It may surprise you to know that I've had long conversations with quite a few people in the medical industry who have quietly agreed with me - there's a big problem and I'm doing the right thing. I'm not talking about NDs and chiropractors (who I also hold in high esteem and who we count on to keep us in glowing health.) I'm talking about nurse practitioners, OBGYNs, and family doctors. \n\nPediatricians in this country also face out of pocket losses if they don't sell their vaccines before they expire. \n\nAs to why I don't listen to 97% of the scientists that say vaccines are perfectly safe? Because I know where their funding comes from. I see what happens to them when they DO speak out. They're fucking crucified. \n\nYou do raise an excellent point about the standards of healthcare in other countries. I need to think about that. I'm not unreasonable and I do consider new information. I also am open to the possibility that I'm completely wrong. So open, that I question my decision every single day. I don't want you to think that I arrived at this flippantly. \n\nThat said, healthcare in the US is VERY different than NZ. \n\nOne last thing - you have vaccine refusers in NZ. They're all over Australia too. I talk to them. They're scared to speak out because of the bullying and ridicule they will face.

And what I was saying re: the difference in healthcare between NZ and the US is that doctors here don't have to sell their vaccines before they expire. They don't \"sell\" anything. Their services are subsidized to a certain degree, and they don't make losses in the same way as they do in the US. So why push vaccines and other health treatments if they aren't necessary? I know in the US a lot of doctors will get tons of tests and scans and treatments etc because they might as well - patients and their insurance pay for it and the doctors gain. Here, it's not like that, and vaccinations are still offered and recommended.\n\nI don't believe that the medical industry is invested in creating patients. There are plenty enough of sick people and a lot of diseases and illnesses that we currently can't control or cure. They have more than enough work on their hands, and in most countries there are shortages of practitioners. They don't need more patients; they need more doctors. \n\nIt's already been said before by other commenters: Dr. Tetyana Obukhanych is not viewed as a reasonable and reliable source outside of the anti vaxx community. Everything I've read of hers shows a basic lack of knowledge of how the immune system works.\n\nWith regard to parents thinking their children \"went away\" after the vaccinations: I'm sorry to say, but yes, it is a coincidence. The timing of autism symptoms (regardless of vaccination) usually occur between 6-18 months. This is because autism is diagnosed based on the development/lack of development of social skills, and these skills simply don't develop until babies are older. They don't coo until 3 months, they don't babble until 4-6 months, they don't properly talk until 12 months. So how can a doctor diagnose that the baby is 'missing' these milestones until they are supposed to have reached them? Babies under 2 years old are rarely diagnosed with autism because doctors are less certain that the delay in social skills indicates autism at such a young age, as the baby might be delayed but not SO delayed so as to warrant autism. So they wait. Meanwhile, the baby is vaccinated, the social skills continue to decline (as they would have done anyway). This means that children are often diagnosed at 18 months - 3 years: after the vaccinations have occurred. Parents then look for reasons as to why their child is suddenly not developing. They may not even *know* that there is something wrong. Another facet of the very way that autism works is that one diagnostic criteria is a regression in social skills between 2-3 years of age. So a baby that seems fine before that point can suddenly regress: this is just how autism works, and has nothing to do with vaccines.\n\nPeople see their child regress, or their child receives an autism diagnosis around this age, and due to the 'autism is caused by vaccines' McCarthy crap, they do *think* about it. Then they do 'research' googling things like \"do vaccines cause autism\" and see other people's articles and 'research' with poor methodology, conflicts of interest, etc. They fear for their child, and need someone to blame (because they obviously cannot accept that autism *just happens* and it's nobody's fault). So they blame the vaccines. Particularly in the US there is a very litigious culture with people wanting *someone* to sue or blame when something goes wrong. Here, you cannot sue doctors. You can't make a medical malpractice case. You cannot sue for injury from vaccines. So people don't *look* for someone to blame. They just help their child.\n\nWhether vaccinated vs unvaccinated children are healther in terms of unrelated illnesses, I have no idea.

I've talked to too many people who see a marked, dramatic difference one day to the next when vaccines are involved. It doesn't make sense that there would be such a drastic change overnight. The kid talks, makes eye contact and behaves normally one day and stops the next day, post vaccine. You know if there's a delay beforehand. \n\n&gt; Particularly in the US there is a very litigious culture with people wanting someone to sue or blame when something goes wrong. Here, you cannot sue doctors. You can't make a medical malpractice case. You cannot sue for injury from vaccines. So people don't look for someone to blame. They just help their child.\n\nYou can't sue in the US either. If your kid is hurt or killed, you have a snowball's chance in hell of winning a paltry sum from the vaccine injury court, and you may fight for years for even that. Pharmaceutical companies have been granted lawsuit immunity from vaccine injuries. Physicians fall under the same category. If my kid is hurt from a vaccine and suffers a life altering and permanent disability, I'm responsible. Not you. That is why I think it is morally reprehensible to demand that people take risks that you will not foot the cost for if it goes awry. \n\nI've thought more about the situation in New Zealand in regards to healthcare. I think that the lie is just that widespread. If one country broke and stopped vaccinating, the system would break. The same companies that supply vaccines for the US supply them for NZ (I think - could be wrong on this one). \n\nIt is a well known fact that politicians in the US are in bed with pharmaceutical companies. You can look at who receives funding from those companies for elections as proof. Policy mirrors those contributions. I don't see why it would be any different in other countries. Maybe I'm wrong. I don't know. \n\nIn Japan, they stopped vaccinating newborns with Hep B. Their infant mortality rates went down. The US has the highest infant mortality rate in the world of any developed country. I agree - we need proper research on vaccinated vs. unvaccinated. But I trust what I see with my own eyes and the countless reports I've heard from parents who have one unvaxxed kid and others who are, and see that difference in health is pretty ubiquitous.\n\nHere's a comment I found that pretty much sums up my feelings on the whole damn thing. \n\n\"\"People believe in vaccines with the fervor of religion and take it about as well when their belief is questioned. It's easier to dismiss all the parents with dead and damaged kids as delusional than to admit that vaccines may have caused that harm, even though the harm is written out in black and white in the manufacturer's own inserts. They have been sold the fear that all disease will automatically kill or permanently injure their children, and dismiss others, like my family, who have the experience of permanent disability or death from the vaccine. They would rather call us anti-vaxxers and pretend that we are crazy and that there is no evidence to support the harm we have experienced than to admit that something we thought we were doing to help people has harmed them instead. It's a terrible thing, cognitive dissonance.\n\nUntil we can acknowledge that vaccines DO cause harm in a certain small number of children and that those kids' lives matter just as much as the kids who catch diseases, we're not going to get anywhere. The only way the vaccine program can go forward ethically is to acknowledge that harm from vaccines does exist, develop screening tests that are administered to all children BEFORE injecting them with vaccines, and weed out the ones prone to harm. This way, we can both protect from disease by utilizing vaccines for those who can handle them, AND protect children from life altering/ending vaccine reactions, so that no parent has to suffer the tragedy of permanently harmed or dead kids. This is the only way that parents will truly be comfortable complying with the vaccine schedule.\n\nSimply saying that all the parental reports of harm after vaccines is coincidence, pretending the harm laid out in black and white in the vaccine inserts is just for fun, and mandating vaccines in a one-size-fits-all manner is not going to cut it. Our kids deserve better.\"\"", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1423240278, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": 1423242323, "gilded": 0, "id": "cod65aq", "link_id": "t3_2uptp9", "parent_id": "t1_cocoikj", "retrieved_on": 1424123285, "score": 0, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"archived": false, "author": "[deleted]", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "[deleted]", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1423240313, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "cod662m", "link_id": "t3_2uptp9", "parent_id": "t1_cod65aq", "retrieved_on": 1424123265, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"archived": false, "author": "BrittBrat893", "author_flair_css_class": "lightcoral", "author_flair_text": "Hailey Renee (Feb 24th, 2014)", "body": "You're really fucking stupid.

There was a lot of overblown ridiculousness. The media do need to be careful to not go overboard, exactly as you say.

If I lived in Mississippi or West Virginia, I'd still be hopping mad at the anti-vaxxers, but I wouldn't feel too concerned for my infant. Here, I have my radar up about measles and whooping cough (we actually do have outbreaks of that). I'm nowhere close to imposing a quarantine or asking for vaccination records before a play date, but I'm comfortable that it's a good idea to talk to my kids' doctor about how they handle vaccinations and manage contagion in their office space.\n\nIt's sad that the fear you talk about is actually what got us to this point. There's so much fear, and I think people want to have some sense of control. The very thing that they ended up fearing was a really good answer to something that people were afraid of for good and rational reasons a generation earlier. \n\nSomeone posted this cute bit of satire on Facebook this morning that you might enjoy: [I'm an Anti-Braker](http://robertmoorejr.tumblr.com/post/110101466091/im-an-anti-braker).", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1423247099, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "coda9tn", "link_id": "t3_2uptp9", "parent_id": "t1_cocyws2", "retrieved_on": 1424119337, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"approved_by": null, "archived": false, "author": "ironicmind", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "banned_by": null, "body": "I can tell several things by your comment.\n1.
