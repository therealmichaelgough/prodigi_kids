For me, it got to the point that I would take the kids outside or to a friend's house as soon as he got home. Any noise from the kids was too much for him and irritated him, even laughter. He ended up getting physical with our oldest son, who was 4 at the time. That was the day I decided to leave him.\nI will never forget the feeling that next morning when I was getting my son dressed, to take him to preschool and it was over 100 degrees outside, but I was putting pants on him instead of shorts to cover the marks. Still breaks my heart to think about it to this day, 11 years later. \nI packed to leave for good, everything I needed for myself and 2 sons (youngest was 8 months old) and picked my 4 year old up from preschool to head to a friend's house. Before I left the house, I opened the phone book to the therapist page and circled the listings. When I got to the preschool the director pulled me aside and even though she wasn't supposed to say anything, she told me she called CPS. She said my son was telling other kids what happened and showing them the marks. \nTo make the matter worse, the CPS  agent called me and told me he was at my house and needed me to bring the kids home. He needed to see us all to do a full report. I asked him to come to me, because I didn't want to go back and he said no. When I got there he looked over the home and took pictures of my son. He then sat us down and told me that this was a first time incident and our house was in good order, so he felt we should work it out, \"because he (my husband) was already taking the right steps in getting help.\" He said this based on the phone book that was open with numbers circled. I wanted so badly to tell him I did that, not him, but I was so scared of losing my boys that night that I didn't say a word. He ended the talk by telling me that I was \"teaching the kids to run away from their problems\" by leaving. I was so hurt, confused and upset. I didn't know what to do. \nI spent the next 5 months trying to make it work, but was still walking on eggshells. I finally couldn't do it anymore and left for good. \nTurns out my ex husband was suffering from depression. He did seek help finally, after several situations where police were called and I had to do a restraining order. He went through anger management and got prescribed medication. To this day, things are still very difficult, mostly because he blames me for leaving him when he was depressed. I don't regret my decision.\nSorry this was so long. I hope you never have to experience this progression. I put it out here though, so you know how serious depression can get. Please do all you can to seek help. If he won't go to a therapist alone, try going to counseling together.
