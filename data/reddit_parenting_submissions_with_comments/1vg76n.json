Somebody else *does* have your kid.

(Of course you really might not be inclined with jerky coworkers.)\n\nI think a huge crucial part of taking time away from the kids (and putting them with a babysitter, daycare, etc) that is often neglected is encouraging women to really take their time, think it through, and decide fully. Based on the lives we have, and the choices we have (or don't have), what is best? *Would* we really rather drop the money and the career advancement and have time with the kids? Or are we better with keeping the career/money? Do we even have a suitable temperament for either one? And then having it settled fully and proceeding with calm assurance that yes, there'll be bumps along the way, but this is what really seemed the right path.\n\nI know all women take these mental steps, but so often it seems like society or family members try to rush the woman into a preconceived assumed path of action. Screw that. This is our one life. I wanted to be a mother more than anything; I'm going to soak up every minute with my kids, my great education and \"earning potential\" be damned. Other moms will have had lifelong dreams of careers. They might want to keep that career the whole way through motherhood; they might want to take a quick pause and then get back to their career. Other moms will feel like me, that they most want time with their kids, but find on introspection that they really can't make it work. *Or* that they really want that career, but can't make it work. And then these women are really making huge sacrifices. \n\nSorry, this has turned into a bit of a rant.
