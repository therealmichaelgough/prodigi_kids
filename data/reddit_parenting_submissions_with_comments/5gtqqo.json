My son was like clockwork as a newborn. Hungry at exactly the three hour mark. Napped at the same time, predictably, every day. I don't know if I had anything to do with this, or if it was just the way he was, but here's the rundown:\n\nHe slept in a Moses basket bassinet right next to my side of the bed for the first 4 months. I breastfed, so when he woke up, I'd change him first, then feed him. One important thing with night feedings was to keep it very quiet and as dark as possible. I had a tiny nightlight which gave off enough glow to see what I was doing. No talking/singing in the night. Just quiet feeding and back to sleep.\n\nSome people recommend bedsharing, but we didn't do that. Also, he spit up a lot, so I wouldn't breastfeed in bed. I thought breastfeeding in bed would be convenient, but I just ended up with spit up all over my pillow.\n\nNow, the stereotypical advice: sleep when your baby sleeps. ACTUALLY DO IT. Don't do chores, or go online, or shower, or whatever else it is you feel you have to do. You HAVE TO SLEEP. I napped with my baby every afternoon. Do it. Every day.\n\nSo now you ask, when did I shower if not when the baby was sleeping? I bought a clear shower curtain so I could see him. I'd put him in a bouncy seat in the bathroom. Shower ever day. You'll feel better.\n\nGet a sling/Ergo/Bjorn/whatever kind of carrier works for you. I did a lot of chores and grocery shopping with the baby in the Ergo.\n\nDuring the newborn stage I was definitely tired from the interrupted sleep, but I still felt generally ok about the amount of rest I was getting. Don't overdo the coffee. If you're taking in a lot of caffeine, once you do have time to rest it will be harder to go to sleep even though your body is tired.", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1481048270, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "dav46t7", "link_id": "t3_5gtqqo", "parent_id": "t3_5gtqqo", "retrieved_on": 1483523292, "score": 25, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"author": "elysians", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "Controversial, but bedsharing.

I was more well rested than when I only had one!\n\nEdit: I would like to point out also that I doubt anyone would roll over on her baby while the baby was attached to a breast, as mine often were.\n", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1481075216, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "davq4se", "link_id": "t3_5gtqqo", "parent_id": "t1_dav0i6q", "retrieved_on": 1483533907, "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"author": "crazy_cat_broad", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "I was so zombied, I had to download an app to keep track of which boob I had fed from last -.- It helped keep track of when to take my meds and when to give the D drop, too!", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1481076059, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "davqr0u", "link_id": "t3_5gtqqo", "parent_id": "t3_5gtqqo", "retrieved_on": 1483534203, "score": 4, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"author": "beanreen", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "It's a nice theory but then I wouldn't have had food, clothes, taken showers and my house would've been even more messy.

Baby one was exhausting but pleasant, and made me think that baby two would be even easier now that I was so experienced.  But baby two basically only did four things: eat, poop, cry, and sleep.  Not much sleep though.  Little bits of sleep surrounded by long periods of nursing, rocking, and carrying around a crying baby and singing to him.  On very bad days I had to wear him in the carrier and take him on long walks just to get him to fall asleep.  \n\nI did the 5Ss with the first baby, it worked wonderfully, and I never really understood colic.  Baby number one rarely cried.  Baby number two screamed through all swaddling, hated being held sideways, and refused to suck on anything but the breast.  It turns out that, like you said, sometimes you cant do anything about it but be there.  I learned not to feel stressed just because of crying, and to patiently keep plugging along.  \n\nIt can be difficult, but things got better gradually.  When he was able to play with toys it helped keep his attention.  He was never a good sleeper, so as he has grown and needed fewer naps naturally, his mood has improved.  He is 16 months old now and I'm just starting to feel a little in control of my life, and by the time they're this age there's no telltale sign of wether or not they were a colicky newborn.  I'm still pretty tired though.  I found that with my method of parenting, the exhaustion lasts until we stop nursing because I don't inhibit the night time feeds.

I don't do it until baby is at the two or three month mark.  Newborns are just too small.  With our first, hubby slept on the couch for a long time because he was afraid of smooshing the baby.  With number two, he sleeps with his back to us and baby sleeps in the middle, not by the edge.  Baby (16 months) actually prefers snuggling his daddy when he isn't nursing, and hubby complains often of being kicked all night.  \n\nNo regular pillows by baby.  If you want a pillow, use a small one that just fits under your head.  You lay on your side and make a letter c with your body, with baby protected inside the curve.  This way baby has access to the breast, and you will feel immediately if your hubby is accidentally rolling over too close.  You can put the other hand on baby to make sure they are safe.  You have to make sure the blanket stays off of baby.  Having his and hers blankets and swaddling the baby or using a wearable blanket is best.  Your blanket stays below your waist. \n\nThey say that you shouldn't bed share if you drink, smoke, take medications that affect your ability to wake up, or are overly tired.  That goes for both parents, and is probably the reason they are campaigning against it by you.  Everyone has to consciously have baby's safety in mind and be in good health and unaffected by any substances.\n\nFor me, bed sharing allows me to maximize the amount of sleep I get while allowing baby to nurse as often as they want.  It means I don't have to get out of bed multiple times a night.  I also enjoy sleeping next to my babies, and I know that they will be small for such a short period of time, and someday they will be too big to sleep with mommy.  I want to savor every moment.  I also sleep better with baby next to me.\n\nWhen number two outgrew his pack n play, I switched to a small mattress on the floor.  I am able to lay next to him while I put him to sleep, and for the first part of the night we have the bed to ourselves.  When baby eventually wakes up, I either go get him or he climbs in himself.  Using the mattress instead of a crib requires vigilance; you have to go to baby as soon as they wake up to keep them out of trouble, or they might unload all your drawers, dump out the wipes warmer, or wreak general havoc.  I would have liked to try a co sleeper, but we have lower IKEA beds.  On the other hand, I keep some pillows on the floor around my side of the bed, and I wouldn't worry if he accidentally fell out from such a low height onto the pillows now that he's a good size.\n\nAnd to wrap it up with how this all started:  My first baby was about three months old and I was absolutely exhausted.  We were spending vacation at my grandmas house, and she has really tall beds compared to what we're used to.  I was nursing baby back to sleep in the middle of the night, which I used to sit up and stay awake for because that's what you're \"supposed\" to do.  Then suddenly I woke up and I was laying down and baby was right there on the edge of the bed, ready to fall any time.  I had no memory of even laying down and putting her there.  It really frightened me, and I decided it would be safer just to plan to have her in bed than to do it on accident and not do it safely. I also decided, after switching to bed sharing, that trying to stay awake at night while baby nurses is unnatural, biologically speaking.  Of course, baby number two has such a firm latch that I can't sleep when he's nursing, so there's that, but at least I don't have to wake up all the way.\n\nGood luck, and I'm sure you'll find something that works perfectly for your family!", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1481087191, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "davy8bk", "link_id": "t3_5gtqqo", "parent_id": "t1_dav0i6q", "retrieved_on": 1483537858, "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"author": "NatalieVictoria", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "I suppose I didn't create a lot of mess alone with a baby so there wasn't much mess to bother me.
