My son went and my daughter goes to daycare, as daycare is by far the more financially interesting choice where I live. I reduced my working hours to 80 pct to keep some amount of sanity, but that as far as we can go, without potentialy compromising long term financial stability.\n\nStill I take offence when people claim I'm letting daycare raise my children. \nDaycare isn't there to wake up in the middle of the night, or when they are ill. Plus they are completely closed for minimum 4 to 7 weeks a year. (Which gives rise to the eternal struggle for vacation time at work, working extra hours to save up more vacation days.)\n\nIn fact there are 168 hours in a week, of which they only spend 36 to 40 max away from me. They only eat 4 out of 21 meals a week while there. I do their laundry,  I provide all the things they need. I actively spend every second I can with them, while they are awake and not in daycare/kindergarten. Either feeding, bathing and, most off all, playing with them. They then have my undivided attention to make up for lost time and bond. And so does my husband.\n\nMore important is that training skills, like eating and drinking independently, manners, discipline and potty training, only work when you work together with the daycare. \nIt's not like you get a free pass on those things. It even only makes it harder, as they may be less strict or consequent at the daycare because of all the other kids there. \n\nMy husband and I raise our kids together. Daycare looks after them when we have to work to ensure they have a house, food, clothes and education when they are older, which is also a part of taking care of them. \n\nGood for you if you are able to stay at home, but that alone doesn't make you a better parent. We all do what we think is best for our kids.
