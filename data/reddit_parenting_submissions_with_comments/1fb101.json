I am 23, and have an 18 month old son. My husband is currently deployed, so I'm here all day every day by myself. My parenting style is love whenever I can, but not to coddle. I will let my son cry it out, but only to a certain extent. And this is where it all begins.\n\nI think I made a mistake by posting what happened as a status on Facebook. The base we are at is a very little town, and a LOT of the spouses find that their hobby is to talk shit (sorry for language) and start drama. Anyways, what happened was:\n\nLast night, I put my son down for bed pretty late, because I didn't get out of the gym until pretty late. In the middle of the night, he woke up and started whimpering, usually he does this if he has a bad dream or wakes up without the pacifier in his mouth. Since I am trying to get rid of the pacifier, I decided to let him cry it out, eventually he will go back to sleep, right? So I hopped in the shower, and I ended up taking a really long one (I really felt like I needed it.)\n\nWhen I got out of the shower, he was still crying. Since I knew that was out of character for him, I went to check on him and give him love. I am guessing he woke up, didn't know where he was, and accidentally fell out of his bed. When I opened his door, he wasn't crying because he fell out of the bed, he was crying because he was trying to get back INTO his bed and it was too tall for him to climb. He's got a shiner on his forehead from where he fell, but it only took 10 minutes of snuggling in the rocking chair for him to fall asleep again.\n\nSo, I posted a status on FB about how I felt bad that he hit his head, my poor baby, but he's ok, blah blah blah. Then I get an angry message waking me up from my husband (he's a whole other story, if you want to know, I suppose I could divulge, but it's rather lengthy) saying \"why the fuck didn't you check on him, are you really that dumb, you're the worst mother ever, I can't believe you let him cry like that, that's abuse, I'm calling CPS.\" When I tried to explain myself, he would not listen. He kept saying, \"What if he broke his arm, blah blah blah\" and he would not accept my reasoning that I know which cry is which, and he was clearly whimpering when I got in the shower, NOT crying in pain. I know the difference. His retort was, \"whatever, you're dumb, don't talk to me.\" So he started ignoring me, and didn't even respond to my suggestion that we skype so that he could see with his own eyes that his son was perfectly fine. \n\nSo, it's ruined my whole day. I've been fighting back tears and trying not to feel horrible. I already feel bad that I let him cry for so long, but now I'm being called an abuser? And I wasn't even given the chance to defend or explain myself, either. Did I do anything wrong? I mean, if I seriously did do something wrong, then please tell me. I'm not perfect, and I would want to know if I can be a better mom. It really hurts me that people would go gossiping behind my back, and that gossip could reach my husband who is thousands of miles away.\n\nI deleted the status on FB, made another status asking people to come to me if they have a problem, and cleaned out my friends list of anyone who I think would start drama. I also changed my privacy settings so that only certain people can see my posts, and I will be more careful of what I post. If something so little can be taken out of context and blown up to this, I don't even want to have a facebook account anymore.\n\nIf you've been through this, I could sure use your help.

That's just my personal feeling and maybe 15 months from now I'll feel different, I don't know.  I don't feel like I have to have eyes on my son if he's safely in his crib but I do feel like if I know he's awake I should be able to hear him.  If I need to take a shower I'll turn on the baby monitor and take it in there with me.  i agree, once they get past a certain age it's okay to let them cry it out, but i don't think it was acceptable for your son to injure himself to the point of having a shiner and you to be unaware of it.  i'm sorry if this sounds mean, but i think you should reevaluate your priorities. from everything i know about the cry it out method, it does not mean go somewhere or do something where you cannot hear your kid crying for an extended period of time. \n\nthat said, i don't think your husband reacted well and shouldn't have threatened to call CPS. he probably should have told you his feelings calmly and asked you to do things differently in the future.\n\nso, long story short:\n \nif you were me, i would no longer be out of earshot of my son when i knew he was awake, i would probably lower the crib mattress if it's not already to its lowest position and/or set up a different sleeping arrangement, and i would talk to my husband about parenting styles and expectations and what my intent was vs what actually happened. \n", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1369880732, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "ca8jvmp", "link_id": "t3_1fb101", "parent_id": "t3_1fb101", "retrieved_on": 1430988964, "score": 11, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"archived": true, "author": "frog_gurl22", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "I agree with this 500%.

It does sound as though it's time to either convert his crib or get him into a toddler bed with a guard rail. Fortunately with my son he never fell out of the crib before we converted his bed, but we saw him climbing over it a few times and knew it was time. Now, I will say that I am terrified of putting together furniture. I was a single mom for 2.5 years before getting married, so I feel like I can say in my most empowered voice that tasks like converting a toddler bed are something that I need my husband to do. I digress, but my point is that if you're anything like me in that regard, I understand why he's still in a crib (presumably). \n\nMoving on...I saw one other person on here comment that your husband has a stressful job and you never know what will set him off blah, blah, blah. There's certainly validity to that and I can appreciate his service, but the choice to join the armed forces was at least on some level a choice he made and he doesn't get to take his stress out on you -- especially without listening to your side of the story first. The way he treated you was unacceptable. Something to remember about deployments: your husband may be feeling powerless from afar and thus may be more prone to lashing out at nothing. Again, this behavior is not acceptable, but it might to some degree help explain why he reacted so strongly. But like I said, he needs to listen and come to you first before he jumps to conclusions. If you're in the US, there are a number of programs available to military couples to help in times of high stress. There are also lots of support groups available. If you'd like more information on any of these, please feel free to message me.\n\nI'm sorry that it ruined your day. I would like to mention, as a social worker who knows a bit about child welfare, DHS is not going to take your son away or judge you or do anything else to inhibit your ability and right to mother your son. If your husband did call and file a report, the most they're going to do is come and check out your house and find that it was an unsubstantiated claim and move on. Mom guilt sucks and so does marital tension, but it doesn't seem as though you have a legitimate reason to feel badly and it sounds as though you truly have your son's well-being at the forefront of your mind. Just keep doing what you're doing and everything will work out. \n\nAs for the facebook bit, I understand the gossipy culture of military bases and my best advice would be to not get sucked into it. It sounds as though you're trying to avoid it, but even removing potential drama queens from your facebook might be enough to stir up some trouble. Maybe you could just be especially cognizant of how people might interpret what you post? I know it's a bummer to censor, but unfortunately it's a necessary evil for most of us.
