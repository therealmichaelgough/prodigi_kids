Mine are all just shy of being 3 years apart in age.

The pregnancy wasn't as tough as it was with the twins but I was definitely ready to be done. My ob-gyn wasn't concerned about there only being 10 months in between pregnancies.  She basically said \"It happens a lot, take your vitamins, eat well, rest as much as you can, and your baby will be fine.\"  The third was born almost a year ago when the twins were 17 months old. So I had three under two for 7 months - never thought I would take on that challenge.  The girls immediately fell in love with her and have become her protector. (of course they get thoroughly annoyed with her every five minutes!)  My husband is awesome and took on the nighttime care for the twins while I went one-on-one with the baby.   \n\nIt's been a difficult year but we are also seeing the light at the end of the tunnel of babydom.  The twins are almost out of diapers and are becoming more helpful around the house.  They also can get up and down stairs, and they can walk with me without needing to be carried.  Not having to carry all of them everywhere has been one of the best milestones that we've hit so far.  Going to the park or the library is so much easier this summer.  \n\nThe first year with a baby and your older one will be tough, but it is still a lot of fun and only seems to get more fun as they get bigger.  Our baby is already walking and climbing, and basically doing everything possible to catch up to her older sisters.  They are a lot of work but it's been totally worth it.
