I looked back and realized how I had wished my sons infancy away and my husband and I decided to have another baby. We were terrified, but you know what changed? I did.....I was so much calmer with my 2nd pregnancy, and knew what to expect. With my son, i cut out coffee, and did all the \"right things\". With my daughter, If i wanted sushi, i ate it, i took that tylenol when i needed it, i didnt give up my coffee, etc. I felt prepared to handle the constant crying because mentally i knew it was coming and knew how fast it really does pass. And guess what....she sleeps 6 hour stints since 4 weeks old!! If you don't want another baby, no one on earth would fault you for that! Just know, every baby really is different and sometimes the circumstances being different are all it takes. \n\nThe other responders are right, you are almost there!

This is the head down in the line of fire and hoping for the best. \n\nIt will get better, I promise.\n\nMy first child was a unicorn. She was laid back, easy going, loved to cuddle. Just a total unicorn of a child. My son, if he was my first child he would've been my last. He cried for 8+ hours a day. Colic, reflux, general hate for his parents... He had it all. \n\nBut once we hit 4 months, he became this child that would laugh, and smile. He would interact with us. We found a routine, we finally started understanding each other. It's hard, frustrating, mentally and physically exhausting.. but it does get better.\n\nIf you have any doubts, if you can get through it safely. Talk to your doctor. PPD isnt something to mess with. I was so severely depressed after 2 complete months of crying.. I thought I was loosing my mind. My Dr helped me out, we eventually found things that worked.\n\nJust remember Mama, it does get better. As tough as it is now, this tiny human is here because of you. You created a tiny resilient, (sometimes) stubborn, strong willed child and they will flourish in the years to come because of you.", "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "created_utc": 1529652701, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e13hvkl", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_8swzi8", "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_8swzi8", "permalink": "/r/Mommit/comments/8swzi8/when_does_the_regret_go_away/e13hvkl/", "retrieved_on": 1529652702, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"approved_at_utc": null, "author": "delirium_red", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "banned_at_utc": null, "body": "I\u2019m glad this worked for you, don\u2019t get me wrong, but I just want to set a few things straight:\n- the thing with breastfeeding is supply and demand. The only thing that gets more milk is baby on breast. It takes about 3 days to increase supply when baby needs more. You just get through it - for me, it was cuddling a breastfeeding in bed most of the day while watching Netflix and my husband brought me food. It doesn\u2019t have to be soul sucking (but it can be, and of course mother\u2019s mental health is important).\n- it takes about 3 months to firmly set in a good milk supply and from then on breastfeeding is a walk in the park for most women. Until then, it\u2019s crucial to feed on demand and as long as it takes. It helps not to have a pacifier until then if you want to avoid feeding problems.\n- it\u2019s not a crime to supplement! But then you need to express the same amount to keep up your supply, every time. Otherwise you are telling your body to make less then the baby needs. \n- it\u2019s normal for babies to be more nervous in the afternoon. Most formula fed babies are as well. But I\u2019m glad switching helped you out, just wanted to explain it doesn\u2019t have to.\n- breastfeeding certainly has benefits, and the boob is amazing - it soothes, feeds, loves, and puts to sleep. But of course you can have an amazing connection with out is as well. \n\nThis is what I\u2019ve learned from lactation consultants that helped me to keep breastfeeding and to make it into a pleasant experience, not soul sucking as you\u2019ve aptly put it. Now still breastfeeding my 15months old and really glad we made it.
