If I could hug you and offer you a nap I 100% would. \n\nI hate myself a little for the comment I'm about to make, because I hated people asking me this. But it ended up being the crux of what was going on for my daughter. How is your supply going? My little one seemed to feed well and often too, she would have been at my breast 24 hours straight if it were possible. She had lots of wet nappies. However, it still wasn't enough for her, she needed more (!!). I worked really hard on getting my supply up (pumping, fenugreek supplements, lactation cookies, domperidone prescription, increased water and caloric intake) but also had to resort to comp feeds with formula in the end. I definitely am not jumping straight to that conclusion for you but I am wanting to be honest about my experience, so I share all this with kindness and not criticism. &lt;3\n\nThe only other thing that we found helpful was being in a dim room, holding her facing our chest and jiggling her up and down quite intensely while supporting her neck and patting her back, whilst SSSH-ing loudly. I know, that's a whole lot of sensory input, seems crazy right? It sure was a workout and it sometimes took upwards of 20-30 minutes to get her to fully calm, but if we stopped at any point during the 20-30 minutes she'd start screaming again, the poor little thing. \n\nKeep in mind that although it feels like you're not able to help, even the fact that you're being with her all this time while she's not feeling great is actually really helping her. You're teaching her that when she's got a big messy feeling, she's not alone with it. You're right there with her trying to figure it out. She is learning that you are reliable, trustworthy and safe. You're laying the groundwork for her to feel secure with you. When my daughter seemed inconsolable for hours I kept the phrase 'Being With' in my mind. Thinking about it this way saved my sanity.

Glad to hear it\u2019s slowly getting better! I\u2019m so looking forward to hear her laugh!\n\nMine is 9 weeks and she has been increasingly better since week 7. \n\nIt\u2019s like one morning she was a different baby... then she had a bad day, and a good one again. Very much the same cycle as yours! \n\nI\u2019m guessing a lot of things played into it. Her digestive system seems to have improved a lot for example. We also stretched her night sleep - comforting her instead of feeding right away. That way we deal less with reflux at night. Also, when she discovered that she could put her hands in her mouth was a big milestone because she self soothes that way. I also got her a transat that she likes (babybjorn). And I stopped eating bovine proteins just in case. I\u2019m trying to re-introduce beef and butter slowly into my diet to see if it really affected her or not! I\u2019m trying biogaia too for her belly, I\u2019ve only seen positive reviews.\n\nIt\u2019s a lot of guessing isn\u2019t it?\nAnd she\u2019s still a rather cranky baby but she\u2019s better. I also realised that she\u2019s sensitive to certain things... we\u2019re learning I guess!

I'm glad it's getting better for you too, we've had loads of hiccups; second lot of injections was just the worst never heard her cry like that before. And after 3 months of breast feeding I just had to stop it was gutting she stopped taking the boob so was combi fed then managed to get most feeds on breast again but then she stopped again! Started using shields again which worked for a week then wouldn't even take me with them. I fought so hard to get my supply back up after I nearly phased it out at week 6 I just couldn't go through that again so she's been off boob for nearly 2 weeks and still mourning it.
