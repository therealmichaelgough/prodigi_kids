I've just started counseling (finally).\n\nI've been having a really, really hard time joining groups- online Facebook groups seem okay at first, but then I have to leave because I can't handle the judgement for whatever I'm doing. I had to leave a postpartum mental health support group on Facebook because one admin was SO ANNOYING. The only way to get her to leave me alone was to leave. It sucks because everyone else was so supportive.\n\nBut it's not just Facebook groups, it's local groups too. Most of them seem really slow, if not dead. They only meet like once a month, or they meet far away. A lot of them center around exercise (that I can't do because reasons), or \"crunchy\" stuff (I tried all of it and absolutely none of it worked out other than breastfeeding). Or they're religious, and I'm an atheist. There's a few groups for military women/spouses, but I'm not military and nobody in my family currently is.\n\nIt's hard to get out and meet people, so hard that I've become really jaded by the \"find mom friends\" advice I've gotten. Like, I'm now convinced it's the worst advice anyone could get, and it's definitely the worst advice I've gotten. The online groups are, for the most part, way better than anyone in real life.
