Infancy lays the blueprints for the rest of their life.\n\nThe best childcare for an infant is definitely someone in the home like a parent or a high quality nanny. Babies do tend to be most attached to their biological mother due to recognizing their physiology from pregnancy. Yet, a high quality nanny is also a great choice if mom chooses to, or is compelled to work outside the home. \n\nGood qualities in a nanny are: patience, kindness, genuinely enjoying being around infants/children, a blend of flexibility and structure (an authoritative caregiving style as opposed to authoritarian or permissive), knowledge of developmental stages and interacting with the child accordingly. If you have a caregiver you trust with helping create your baby's blueprints that is awesome! The only issue is that the baby will likely create a strong attachment bond to this caregiver who will eventually leave the family, which can be very hard on them, but that will happen at any age. \n\nUltimately, though, you get to decide! There is so much mommy stigma, I advise people to just opt out of it. If you like working, want to continue working, and that will best help support your family, then work! It seems like you'd prefer to stay home when your baby is older and that is okay! You're not going to permanently scar your baby by working- as you said, you turned out fine! \n\nOften times it seems like the choice is to work full time or stay at home full time, there are other options. Obviously it varies drastically by company and industry, but working part-time or working from home a few days a week are fantastic ways to get the best of both worlds. If you particularly like your company, go to HR and see if there is any flexibility. If you're willing to work somewhere else find somewhere with awesome family supporting policies. \n\nEven working 30 hours a week versus 40 is a huge difference. Working from home 2 or 3 days a week can save you a bunch of time in commuting and lunch, which you can spend with your baby. If you work from home I strongly urge you to have full childcare set up so you can actually work during your work hours, but even eating lunch with your baby is a nice bonding time. \n\nI plan on starting a family next year and my plan is to work part time after staying home for the first few months. I want to have several hours with my baby every day, which isn't possible with many full time jobs.  I value financially contributing to my family, and having a place in the 'adult world', I also know I don't do well without outside structure in my week,.\n\nTrust that you will make the right choice for yourself and your family.

It is fairly easy (but expensive) to find good childcare coverage before Kindergarten. Both of my kids attended a daycare that provided excellent care from 7:30-6:00. Now that my oldest has entered Kindergarten, it's gotten a lot more complicated. He does attend an after-school program most days, but between school holidays, after-school program closures, teacher in-service days, early dismissal days, inclement weather days and sick days, it's pretty hard to cobble together enough childcare for a 40-hour workweek. This week alone I've had to pick him up twice at 2:45 because his after-school program was closed, and the school has early dismissal at 11:30 this Friday. I've been having to work every night this week to try to make up the lost time.  I'm really not looking forward to this summer when we will have to sign our kid up for camps all summer long that have weird hours that cut into the workday. I know it's going to get even harder as they get older and get involved in sports and other activities. I also think daycare is wonderful for socialization and learning - the transition to Kindergarten was no big deal for my kid. But now that's he's in school, he sees that other kids get picked up by their parents and wants to know why I can't do that. And he is EXHAUSTED when I pick him up at his after-school program at 5:30. It's pretty guilt-inducing.
