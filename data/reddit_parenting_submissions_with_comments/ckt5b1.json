See what preschool programs they offer and what fun events they host. They are usually free/super cheap to attend. Also make a list of all of the play places near by, write down their special days like toddler Time or BOGO admission. See if they have membership or multiple trip passes for a discount. That way if people are busy you have an activity or two to go do alone. \n\nThe tribe thing is important because sometimes you'll have appointments or errands where you really don't want to bring the kids and you'll need a day time sitter. This is where we all swap childcare. Or you might be sick after hubs is gone to work and need someone to drop off some meds to your doorstep or the kids will be sick and running to the store for trash bags and Clorox wipes will be impossible so a local mom friend who can run that errand for you can save your day. \n\nThose are the two biggest things I slowly learned that had someone told me before I wandered around aimlessly for the first year would have made a big difference. \n\nI also personally like to have 2 things we do every week.

When he was younger, it was a little easier as he was napping 3-4 times a day so I had more work time. Now that he\u2019s nearly a year and a half, he loves helping me with everyday chores like putting the laundry away, putting dishes in the dishwasher, etc so as far as those things, I\u2019ve gotten pretty good at staying on top of it. \n\nBut at the end of the day, I\u2019m always super happy for my fianc\u00e9 to come home and take over the baby for his dinner and bath/bedtime while I either finish work for the day or, if it\u2019s done, just relaxing with a book in the bedroom. I still don\u2019t take care of myself as much as I should but I\u2019m working on it and it\u2019s gotten way easier as time goes by. I also go to sleep before 9:30 and stay tired almost all the time \ud83d\ude05 But it\u2019s all worth it, for sure. \n\nIf there\u2019s anything specific you have a question about, feel free to ask or message me.
