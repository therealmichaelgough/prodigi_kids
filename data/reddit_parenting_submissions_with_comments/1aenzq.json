He took me to court, he lost that battle, but got every other weekend (per my request)\n\nNow, this morning, he is coming to pick him up. Last night I had to tell him what formula to buy, what size diapers he wears, etc etc, because he still hadn't asked about it the night before he is supposed to take him.\n\nHe has never cared for an infant before. When I asked him how to wash a bottle, give him a bath, mix and make formula he said \"well, Ill figure it out\" Not to mention, my son is ill. He is so clogged up that he is having trouble eating and sleeping. I am giving him albuterol (sp?) a few times a day, prescribed by his doctor.\n\nI asked him to please come up for a few days before the first weekend so he could get to know my baby's routine and learn how to care for him. He said no.\n\nI got a doctors note from his pediatrician saying it would be a bad idea for his father to take him for the weekend considering he is ill and he has never been away from me before, and that taking him away from me while he was ill would be detrimental to his mental and physical health. I asked his father if he would rather just come up and spend the weekend at my home and visit instead of taking him two hours away from me when he was sick. he refused.\n\nI am so scared of for the well being of my child. He has no idea how to care for him- none at all.
