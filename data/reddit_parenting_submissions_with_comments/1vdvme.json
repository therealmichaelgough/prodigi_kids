I don't get to go out and have fun, I am tired of getting into fights with my husband just because I am stressed out and frustrated and really don't care for or about anything he has to say at that time.

Not forever, just until the ship rights itself a bit. \n\nPaper plates, disposable forks -- yeah sometimes it's just like that.\n\nLimit your kids to the kids-only section on Hulu or netflix or something, or DVDs only. Or try audiobooks instead? That way you know exactly what the content is ahead of time without having to screen and make decisions all the time.\n\nIt is totally OK to make your kids take a break from a show simply because it is melting mommy's brain. \n\nUnderbed bins. For cars, for Legos, etc. when my kids were little I got a dustpan and mini broom for them to use on toys.\n\nPack away like 3/4 of their toys, seriously they won't even notice and cleaning gets so much easier.\n\nHave emergency fun activities for when you need time to do something. Like a package of nesting gift boxes on clearance after Christmas = wooooo playtime! \n\nI don't know what your current standards are for housekeeping, kid presentability, meal prep etc but whatever they are, LOWER them. Cream cheese on toast + sliced cucumber is totally a meal! Pasta with a little butter and a side helping of steam in the bag veggies -- bam, done. A baked sweet potato -- hey healthy easy cheap lunch, how ya doing?\n\nIt's OK if your kids don't bathe daily. Or even every other day. Free up chunks of time wherever you can.\n\nIf you have a four or five year old, assign helper tasks. They can run around the house and gather stray dishes, they can fold towels (they do a shitty job but that's no prob with the magic of lower standards!)\n\nIt is OK to ask for space sometimes. My four year old nephews walked in talking when I was going to the bathroom and I explained that I don't like to talk to people in the bathroom, so please go out and wait. They cracked up as they left and said yeah our daddy doesn't like that either we don't know why! Haha! \n\nI love hugs and cuddles but it turns out that when I'm eating I do not like anyone to touch me or be in my face. Put my plate in front of me and I turn into a cranky old cocker spaniel. Both of my kids would leeeeeaaannn on me during meals and it was like nails on a chalkboard. So that was a new rule -- do not lean on mama while she is eating. I mean on the one hand what a dumb rule! They aren't hurting anything! But on the other hand, it's not bad for kids to see that we own out own bodies and can set rules like that when something bothers us.\n", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1389921927, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "cerixpt", "link_id": "t3_1vdvme", "parent_id": "t1_ceri9l9", "removal_reason": null, "retrieved_on": 1431976417, "score": 9, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"archived": true, "author": "brenders", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "Woah now!
