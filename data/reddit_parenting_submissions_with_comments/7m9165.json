My daughter is 18 months and she is into everything... which is really affecting my ability to do the basic self-care in the morning like washing my face, brushing my teeth, god forbid showering or blow drying my hair. The last time I took a shower with her locked in the bathroom with me, she ignored the box of toys we keep in the bathroom and instead, broke into the drawer where I keep my tampons (there was a drawer lock on it but apparently she has super-toddler strength?) and threw tampons all over the bathroom before screaming at me and banging on the glass shower door. Now, mommas, I try to be zen about it and use soft voice to say \u201cI\u2019m almost done and I\u2019ll be just a minute\u201d and I sing songs and recite books, but y\u2019all I AM TIRED AND I JUST WANT TO SHOWER. So here is my question \u2014 what works/worked for you at this age? Did you get up early before your kid? Did you only shower when your SO could watch them? (This is harder for me since my SO travels a lot and is often on last-minute conference calls.) Did you toddler proof-the bathroom and just let them scream? I\u2019ve honestly thought about buying a second set of all of my toiletries to have downstairs so I can use them in the kitchen while she eats breakfast. I\u2019m just so tired of this and I would so appreciate some new strategies to try (I\u2019m sure a lot of them are obvious but I\u2019m mom-stupid after the holidays.)", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How do you get your self care time in the morning?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/7m9165/how_do_you_get_your_self_care_time_in_the_morning/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads"}, "comments": [{"approved_at_utc": null, "author": "pynkgodde55", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "body": "My kids play in the tub while I shower.
