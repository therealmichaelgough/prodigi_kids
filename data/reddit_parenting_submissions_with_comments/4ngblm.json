People blame the parents for not vaccinating their kids, but how many of us adults make sure to keep our own immunizations up to date and get the needed booster shots? We want to blame everyone else without taking on any responsibility for ourselves.\n\n&gt;That's the thing with herd immunity\n\nI know how herd immunity works. I wasn't talking about herd immunity.

There's so much fear and there doesn't need to be. Common sense, yes. vaccines, yes! But fear and the ensuing hatred/contempt? Hell no.
