This is NOT an attempt to bash parents of multiple kids.\n\nThat said, I am the only one among my friends and acquaintences who has chosen to stick with one, and it's a bit isolating. I don't know if it's just where I live or a universal thing, but my son was barely born before people were asking about when we'd have our next one. And for a while, we did contemplate it.  But with one thing and another, we've decided that 3 is a good size for our family, so one and done it is.\n\nThe problem is that now when I get the \"when will you give him a sibling\" question, and I say \"we're done,\" I get generally negative reactions. People question our reasons, argue with me (not my husband -- he never gets this!), act like I must be some frigid, baby-hating bitch...it's depressing, and I never know how to respond.\n\nMy husband makes fun of me for needing other people to validate my decisions, but he also isn't the one with the endless \"WHY DON'T YOU WANT ANOTHER BABY?!?\" refrain. So I come to you, parents of Mommit...Do you get these questions? What do you tell people? \n\n**TL;DR: Give me a good come-back to the nosy questions that doesn't implicitly criticize someone else's family decisions.**\n\nEDIT: Wow, thank you for all the positive comments! :-) There are so many great ideas in here!

As far as we are concerned, financially and emotionally, we are able to go above and beyond for one, but would completely be off the rails with 2. And that's okay.\n\nNo one else has a right to what you choose to do with your family. What works for one family does not always work for others. I still get the \"will you try for a boy? Are you giving your girl a sibling? She'll be spoiled, lonely, a brat etc.\" And I just let it roll, because there is no reason to waste energy on people so set in their ways. \n\nIf I am faced with pushy people, I usually throw down a simple, \"this is how we want our family.

My mom's sisters have a very chilly relationship too.  So when people tell me \"oh, he'll be best friends with his little brother/sister!\" I have the other possibility in mind too. My father walked out fairly early on, and my mom had to struggle to support us.

I know quite a few only children and not a single one is sad or angry about it. And yes one of the big reasons I do not want another child is monetary. We are barely making it as is and another child will double most of the expenses we are barely keeping up with now. Our life is hard and stressful but at the moment its manageable. With another child I feel like everything will spiral out of control.  Another reason I do not want another one is more of a selfish reason yes but it's me. After having my first one I felt alone and struggled with depression a lot. Things are better now but I often feel like I am barely making it. Between being a mom, wife and full time employee and still being expected to keep a clean house and full homemade meal on the table every night I am barely hanging on. While I know I would love the child, I feel like having that much more on my plate would push me off the edge. I know that sounds selfish etc but I strive to be a great mother to the child I have and I would strive for the same thing with a second child but I don't feel like I could be that. I do love my daughter and it's not like I don't want to be a parent at all, I love being her mother. She is hilarious and beautiful and brilliant.  I just have no desire for more.
