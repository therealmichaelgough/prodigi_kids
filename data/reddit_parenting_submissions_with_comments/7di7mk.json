We had this grandfather clock and it had a spindle thing up top that an angel was placed on every year... her arms bent and I thought it was rather brilliant of me to cradle Jesus in the angels arms.  Well... Christmas came and my mom was distraught.  Baby Jesus was gone.  And I had no recollection of moving him, so I joined in on the searching.  Well.  I lost him.  We put away the decorations but missed the angel. We noticed a week or so later, but that was typical.  We waited to accumulate the other Christmas stuff we missed and put it away all at once... that year it was just the angel, so she stayed looking down on us until one day in March.  I was talking to my dad and got distracted by the angel and noticed her arms bent just so perfectly to hold...  yeah.  Jesus was born in March that year.
