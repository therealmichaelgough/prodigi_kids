The mom had extreme difficulty conceiving and it was a long, upsetting and expensive process. Her husband was ambivalent about having kids, and it was difficult to get him to be supportive of her throughout that process. I\u2019ve heard rumors that if they didn\u2019t have this kid that she was going to leave him. The birth was difficult and the baby was 4 weeks premature, so he has some developmental delays, but he's a happy and healthy kid. \n\nSince I've been nannying for them, I've been told explicitly by the father that he is not interested in raising his son, that maybe when he's older, he'll be more interesting to him, he tells his son \"I'm so happy to see you...NOT! I just have to say that\" and a bunch of other shocking and upsetting things. He doesn\u2019t read to him, or feed him, or notice him, unless he absolutely has to or feels like he needs to keep up appearances. Both parents and I had a group communication channel which he has left because he \u201cdoesn\u2019t like answering questions\u201d and he became so hostile to me every time I asked or mentioned his son, that I became hesitant to talk to him about anything baby related. I didn\u2019t allow him to intimidate me with his anger and confronted him about it, and he apologized and said that his wife is \u201cused to it\u201d but I haven\u2019t been privy to it until I started nannying and that\u2019s no excuse and he\u2019s sorry. I can\u2019t imagine what she endures in private.\n\nThe mom is basically a single mother, which would be difficult enough, but out of resentment, the father deliberately tries to undermine her (and my) efforts to nurture him and keep him safe. Yesterday he unplugged the crib camera so the mom couldn\u2019t see that he left the baby in there all morning, and said that the baby unplugged it (impossible). The baby also started crawling forward this week, and both me and the mom want to childproof the play space (put gates up, remove or gate a glass coffee table) and he\u2019s fighting her on it/lying to me about planning to do it. He also told me earlier this week that he\u2019s already banged his head on it SEVERAL TIMES, which means he\u2019s watching him crawl over to it and not stopping him. \n\nBefore anyone says \u201cshe should leave/divorce him,\u201d I want to make it clear that before the kid, they went to counseling and almost split up, and didn\u2019t. I really truly doubt that she will leave him, so I\u2019m trying to come up with a more moderate way of supporting/empowering her and ensuring that the dad doesn\u2019t undermine the safety/development of his son. \n\nI also get the impression from the other moms in our circle that the dad\u2019s ambivalence and negligence, while super obnoxious, isn\u2019t exactly uncommon. How concerned should I be? He\u2019s clearly emotionally abusing his wife, but by most standards, between the mom\u2019s and my care, the baby is fine. If this were my partner I would be beside myself, but I would also never have a child with someone who was so blatantly and admittedly immature and disinterested. Any advice?\n\ntl;dr I\u2019m a nanny for a baby with a negligent, immature, needy father and his resigned, exhausted and depressed wife.

My husband doesn't really read or interact one-on-one with our child unless I'm out of the house. (Put another way, if I'm at home, I am THE parent and he's off doing his own thing.)\n\nBut, he would *never* harm our child. Ever. Physically or emotionally. Our child is 17mo and he understands so much at this age - already! He doesn't even talk yet and he understands stuff. So this guy telling his own child that he's not happy to see him (and the other shocking and/or upsetting things), I'm sure the child can pick up on that. \n\nSo you've got problems with anger.

Be a source of calm stability for the kid.
