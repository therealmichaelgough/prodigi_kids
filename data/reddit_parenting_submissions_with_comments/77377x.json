She doesn't take bottles, otherwise I'd have been helping with feeding long ago. My wife feeds her on demand, which I support. Her leaving our baby with me so she can have her own time is, frankly, impossible. Yes, I know how terrible that is.\n\n* Her baby-waking-up-in-the-middle-of-the-night routine involves her getting her out of the bassinet, taking her to the nursery to change her diaper, going to the living room to feed her, burping her, and giving her time upright to prevent spitting up and to fall asleep. It's a routine she developed and wants to keep in place. Every single time I woke up when she was getting our baby out and I asked if she wanted my help she gave me a very clear \u201cNo\u201d with her head. She didn\u2019t want any interruptions in the routine. We agreed that if she *does* need my help that she is to wake me up and I\u2019ll take over. This has happened once, maybe twice, in the past couple of months.\n\n* She is a stay-at-home mom. I am at work at a full-time job M-F. She has her own personal business that she manages in her \u201cown time\u201d (obviously that\u2019s a very relative term and I absolutely recognize that). She does what she can with our baby as far as activities outside the house are concerned, but anything she does must involve our daughter, so she\u2019s doing kid things and not adult things. To reiterate, leaving our baby with me isn\u2019t an option since she is exclusively breastfed. We have no friends or family here to help us. It\u2019s us and that\u2019s it. This also excludes daycare, which we can\u2019t afford here anyway.\n\nWhen she isn't being overwhelmed with whatever makes her behave this way she is a terribly good person. She's a great mother who loves our daughter and is always looking for thing to help enrich her development. Her \"real\" self is nothing like the person I am living with now, but *this* person believes that she *is* the real version of her, and that her awful thoughts and feelings are genuine.  I don't believe it. We have our differences, and things haven't always been peachy keen, but that's nothing really extraordinary.  We used to hold hands, kiss, call each other by pet names, laugh and smile together. From the very day we got home from the hospital that all virtually completely disappeared.\n\nTo be fair, I know and am well aware that you're only getting my \"side\" of this; surely if she were to tell her perspective it would sound much different.\n\nI would like to get some insight into this. I know I'm not the only man who has experienced this kind of change in behavior. I wrote a nearly identical post in /r/Daddit and someone PMed me with a story so close to mine it was uncanny; I hadn't told the details I posted here, which made it more unreal.\n\nIs this PPD?

Two years from now? Could I survive four years of nursing school and THEN leave him? \n\nI ended up talking to my dad about it. He could see a lot of my mom in me, especially right then.

I want to help you feel better.\"\n\nOr, something along those lines. Your mileage may vary. My partner isn't very sentimental, so I don't get supportive sentences like that. I have to navigate my feelings on my own and really be the bigger person. Your wife may not be able to do that right now. It's going to be hard.

Everyone on Reddit loves to diagnose any new mom who fails to shit rainbows all day with PPD. She might just be exhausted and feeling resentful towards you. I'm speaking from experience here.

Try it by yourself with her in the other room. But bottle feeding just means she'll have to pump, so it's not much of a stress relief unless it's letting her get out of the house. \n\nDo other things. Change diapers, do baby's laundry, cook dinner, wash dishes, take out the trash. Whatever else you can do. During night wakings, can you do everything except the feeding? You get up, check diaper (if that's what she wants done, though might not be necessary at this age unless there's poop), then hand baby off for a feed. Afterwards, you hold the baby upright and get baby back to sleep. \n\nGet your wife rested and take a little responsibility off her plate. If she's still a different person, then I'd be worried.

The last thing a mom who's been home all day caring for a baby wants to hear is \"what's for dinner?\"  I would have happily throttled my partner every time he asked that question.  You bring dinner home, you make her eggs and toast if you can't cook fancy, you hold the baby while she eats.   \n\n-  she needs to leave the house by herself.  A haircut, pedicure, lunch with a friend, anything that gets her out on the weekends is good.  Baby will be fine for an hour or two without boob on demand, and she will get some room to breathe.  She can feed baby right before she leaves and as soon as she gets home.  \n\n- are you being as involved as she will let you?  Do you bathe the baby, play peekaboo and make silly faces at her, buy her little gifts and clothes?  Do you go to her dr appointments and keep yourself up to date on stages and appropriate growth and development?  I had PPD that manifested as anger, and seeing my partner manifest a very active interest in the baby would have gone a VERY long way in calming me.  A lot of new dads have said that it can be hard to feel attached to a very young baby, who you're just meeting for the first time, while to a new mom she feels like she's \"known\" the baby for months and can find it very upsetting if her partner doesn't immediately show adoration or if her partner talks about the baby like an object.

The *last* thing I feel is unattached. My daughter- ........Being a father is the one thing I have always wanted most in life. I love my baby more than life itself. I feel attached at the soul to her. She is my absolute world.\n\nAnd that is why my wife knows she can get to me by threatening me with divorce. Being in a liberal city, and being a woman, her chances of getting full custody, or close to it, are *extremely* high. Apparently women can do no wrong, and women know they can get custody even if they're full blown Casey Anthony.  Good fathers are commonly kept from their children by courts wildly sympathetic to women and cold to men. It blows my mind how no one even talks about this. Anyway, I'm rambling. The point is: I love my daughter more than anything else.  I want to spend all the time in the world with her. I hate having to give her up for meal time, even though she obviously needs it! I just want to hold her and feel her pressed against me and kiss her cheeks and the top of her head and listen to her baby babble, and make her smile and laugh.... Being at work and away from her is so hard, and my wife doesn't even acknowledge it.\n\nI can't really attend most appointments because of work. She doesn't have too many now anyway because she's healthy and only needs to be seen at her bi-monthly checkups. Hell.....my wife got mad at me for always bringing myself up when it came to her doing things with her. While I'm at work she takes her to story time at book stores and libraries (where someone reads books to kids), takes her to little events and classes, and does things here at the house with her. I used to always mention that I wish I could be a part of it all, and she got mad at me for \"making everything about [me]\" and supposedly not letting her \"have\" that with her.  Apparently my interest in her and being involved *must* mean that I want hers to be diminished. She does have a very zero-sum game mentality, though, so it's not surprising that she would respond that way. And of course it's quite alright for her to talk about everything *she* gets to do with our baby.\n\nIf I could get her to leave the house I would. She won't leave the baby here since she worries about the baby being hungry. She flat out won't do it. And even if I suggest that she feed her and go somewhere, she'll ask what the point is.  \"If I have to be back in an hour, what do I have time to do?  It'll take me 20 minutes to get somewhere, and 20 minutes to get back, so, what, I should leave to do something for a whole *20* minutes?\" While she *does* have a point, she's also working against herself. She complains about never being able to leave, but rationalizes a way out ever being able to do so. I think it's some self-fulfilling prophecy thing where she has to be able to complain about something and be able to play the victim card, and cry about how everything is so hard for her. No mention of how she brings a lot of it on herself, but hey, who am I to say anything, right?\n\nMaybe I could get her some takeout or delivery. She's vegan, and I'm not (not even vegetarian), so I'm not as in tune with what she can eat (plus she's having to restrict certain things like soy to avoid upsetting baby's belly). It wouldn't hurt to just ask if she'd want it at all, but like most other things I wouldn't be surprised if she gave me an exasperated sigh about how she *can't* have it because of....reasons.\n\nI feel like I live in Crazyland.", "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "created_utc": 1508328439, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "doj9rti", "is_submitter": true, "link_id": "t3_77377x", "parent_id": "t1_doiz2yw", "retrieved_on": 1508328439, "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"approved_at_utc": null, "author": "snoogle312", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "body": "Even if they aren't seeing her regularly they will have insight and resources you won't find here as well as possibly being able to offer actual hands on aid in sone capacity.

When you do cone to her with these concerns be as gentle and calm as possible but be prepared for her to respond with anger because from what it sounds like that's just how she responds to you now. Depending on how she acts with her family it may be beneficial to hace them present for a mini-intervention to convince her to seek help for PPD.\nSome of your following responses seem to indicate that she may have an unhealthy fixation on your child. My son is 2 and my husband was struggling with beginning treatment for depression right before and after he was born so I attempted to do everything myself. I tried to do all the night wakings, put him to sleep, cook meals, clean etc. This is very hard and leaves a person pretty exhausted and irrational. Even single parents are able to and relish getting a couple hours away from the baby. It is normal and healthy. Her perceived inability to do so may indicate something deeper. \nYou've said you don't think she would hurt your daughter and that's good but then you really don't know what she's like when you aren't there just as others don't know what she's like with you when they aren't there. That said I don't know either so I could ne completely off the mark on that one. But what about herself? Do you have any concerns over the possibility of self-harm? What about yourself? She clearly has rage issues concerning you, is there a possibility of her trying to hurt you?\nAn important thing to keep in mind about PPD and PPA is that these are medical issues that can not be resolved through discussion alone or waiting till it goes away. The best thing you can do for your family now is to find a way to convince her to seek help. There is no shame in this. Involve family. Involve friends even.
