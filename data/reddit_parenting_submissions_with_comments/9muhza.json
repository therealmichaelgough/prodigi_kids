I would have just been awake and having to try to wake him up to do it anyway, so neither of us would have gotten sleep. He works from 7-6, so even when he gets home at night there's not a lot of wiggle-room for him to help out. I guess I could have him do bedtime, but since I am still nursing it's just easier for me to do it, and by that time of night I'm in my groove and energized anyways. \n\nYou mentioned that you both work for the same company and that you work from home since everything is online. Is it an option for him to work from home for a few weeks as well? That may help with him not only complaining that working outside the house is more strenuous (we both know that's not necessarily the case, but I know to outsiders WAH jobs tend to look like you just sit on the couch in your PJs all day) but also help him realize and appreciate just how much you do, on top of being able to rotate and hand off tasks throughout the day.\n\nStop the housework. Do the absolute bare minimum. Not really as a spiteful jab at him, but more for your own sanity. Got enough clothes to get through five days? Only do laundry on the weekends when you can hand the baby back and forth and work together, and don't bother folding anything that doesn't absolutely need it. If that motivates him to do a little bit of extra housework when he gets home, then even better. If it's an affordable option for you, talk to him about hiring a maid service. I haven't used one myself, but I've got several friends who do and they are surprisingly inexpensive and do *amazing* work, quickly. If husband can't do nighttime wake-ups then he can tidy up the house when he gets home from work. No more cooking daily dinners. Either do mealprep weekends when he's there to help or learn to live on pizza and cereal for a little while. This isn't going to be so bad forever, so for now you need to just cut to the bare necessities and take care of you and your baby. You can start vacuuming the stairs again when the baby starts sleeping more. \n\nTake advantage of your naps!! I know that pumping and working can't necessarily wait, but see if you can work out a pattern (I've been using the Glow Baby app for a year and a half for this. The community stuff is crap, but the pattern tracker is wonderfully helpful to know when and for how long I can expect baby to eat/sleep/poop.) I'm obviously at a much further stage where stretches between sleeps are longer, but I know I have four hours in the morning to work and play, then I take a nap with him for anywhere from 45 minutes to 2 hours, then we eat lunch and play for a bit, I work for 2 more hours, take another nap, and then start cooking dinner. Dinner and bedtime routine, put him to bed around 9 and then I work for another 3 hours or so and get myself to bed around 12, so I sleep about five hours at night and anywhere from two to four hours during the day (usually around three.) I could theoretically cut the naps and go to bed when he does, then just work while he naps, but I need a recharge after a few hours of constant work and baby duty! I would much rather have those three hours of focused work without distractions at night and then take those recharger naps during the day. Your windows will definitely be shorter and more sporadic, but once you've been tracking it for a while it helps your sanity and you'll start to form an idea of what your day will look like instead of just \"I think I just changed a diaper, is he crying because he's hungry or tired now?\"\n\nIf he wants you to take the morning shifts, fine, he needs to take the evening shift. Have him take care of bedtime so you can take a little nap in the evening before you have to do the first night waking. \n\nHave a super frank discussion with him. It sounds like you're already very comfortable with that, explain to him that while he does have to get up and go out of the house and do work for eight hours, you *literally never* get a break. Break down your day and explain to him exactly what you do, hour by hour (again, having the chart from Glow Baby would be a nice visual. I definitely used this to give my husband a wake-up call in the early days. I still remember the day I changed 29 diapers.) He works with you, so he should have a good idea of how much work you're putting in, but you're *also* taking care of the baby at the same time *and* keeping the house together. He may be working an 8-hour day, but you're working *21 hours a day.* Make him agree on a schedule for when you can make up some of the difference. Especially if you have PPD, that is a seriously dangerous situation and he needs to understand that. PPD is not something to mess with. \n\nSo TLDR, how I made it work during that time: Stop cleaning the house unless totally necessary. Eat frozen dinners or takeout. Get an app or a scheduler or something to track patterns, find the patterns your baby falls into, and plan your own time (loosely) around that. Schedule \"Daddy time.\" \"Daddy time\" is important not only for their bonding relationship and love and whatnot, but it's definitely important for mom's health, both mental and physical. If he works 9-5 he can take 5-6 to chill out after work, you can eat dinner, and then he can take 6:30-8 or something like that so he doesn't feel like you're just dumping the baby in his arms as soon as he gets home, but you still get your own time to yourself. For me, since my husband works so much later and I do have sympathy for his 55-60 hour weeks, Daddy Time is just weekend mornings. He wakes up early anyways, so Saturday and Sunday he takes the first wakeup until the first nap time. That means that I get to go back to sleep for 2-3 hours in the morning, nurse before nap, and then go *back* to sleep for my nap. It's glorious and absolutely makes a huge difference. \n\nGood luck! I hope you are able to work out something sustainable for your growing family soon! The first part is the hardest.

My baby is 4 months old now but during the early weeks I'd try to sleep when baby slept during the day even if it meant not having things clean or dinner done. My husband doesn't help me with baby shifts but in those early days he made sure to bring take out or cook something while I was watching the baby. Nowadays we take turns cooking when he comes home so one of us can watch the baby. I also wait for him to come home so I can hand him the baby and get some cleaning done, I try to clean just one room a day so the mess doesn't pile up. When my husband stopped helping me with the baby I was clear about not being able to keep up with both the housework and the baby and he understood to not have high expectations so maybe that's a conversation you should have with your husband.
