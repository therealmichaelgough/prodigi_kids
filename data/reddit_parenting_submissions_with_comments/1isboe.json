I also posted this in /r/babybumps.\n\nWhen teaching a child his/her first words, did you or do you plan on teaching \"Mama\" and \"Dada\"?\n\nThe words \"Mama\" and \"Dada\" just kind of rub me the wrong way, but maybe they won't if I understand. You see, I would really like if our child would learn to call us \"Mom\" and \"Dad\", because I just feel cringy when ever I hear a child that speaks clearly still saying \"Mama\" and \"Dada\". I understand that the repetition sticks for babies, but do you absolutely have to teach them \"Mama\" and \"Dada\" as their first words? Will it affect the child's ability to learn language if you teach your baby you are \"Mom\", you are \"Dad\" rather than \"Mama\" and \"Dada\"?\n\nWhat did you teach your child to call you? Did you start out as \"Mama\" and \"Dada\" and then once their language was developed a decent bit switch it to \"Now I am 'Mom'/'Dad'\"?\n\nI know this is probably a silly question, but it has been on my mind since before I was ever even thinking about pregnancy. I see my friend's kids and they all learned \"Mama\" and \"Dada\" but it's been a handful of years and that still has yet to change for those kids and now that they are talking in sentences I get bit of a cringe every time I hear them say something like, \"Mama/Dada, this and that, this is a full sentence.\" You know? I feel as if it's impressive in the sentence moment, but sounds so silly by the baby-like title.\n\nShould we start out with \"mama\" and \"dada\" and then move on to \"mom\" or \"mommy\" and \"dad\" or \"daddy\"? Or should we start out with one title and just stick with it? How soon after a child learns \"mama/dada\" do you then start trying to teach them it's now different?\n\nI know, I know, I'm completely over thinking this, and I am sorry, but damn am I curious. Haha.\n\nIs it a bad thing if your child's first word isn't \"mama\" or \"dada\" but instead something like \"kitty\" or \"doggy\" or...idk. If a child can learn a different word as their first word like \"train\" or \"plane\" why can't their first title of their parents be \"mom\" or \"dad\"? I mean, I may be crazy, but my godson's mother was cooing over him the other day and going on and on about how his first word was \"dada\" and \"did you hear him say it!\" But all it sounds like to me was babble. Then his five year old brother came by and said \"Hey!\" and crystal clear I, swear there was no mistaking it, I heard my godson say \"Hey!\" right back. I was like, \"Did he just say 'Hey'?\" and his mother responded, \"Nah, that's just him making noise. But...like...It didn't sound like a babble I heard before when he supposedly said \"dada\".\n\nI'd just really like some insight into a baby's first words if anyone has any.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Question on \"Mama\" and \"Dada\" titles.", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/1isboe/question_on_mama_and_dada_titles/", "user_reports": []}, "comments": [{"archived": true, "author": "interplanetjanet", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "I have literally never met a child over the age of two who says \"mama\" or \"dada\".\n\nIt's not that people teach their children to say mama and dada over mom/mum and dad.

Moms and dads get all excited about those particular babbles, and so babies say \"Hey, I\"m communicating!\" and keep it up. Eventually, they get around to figuring out who comes to \"mama\" and who comes to \"dada.\" Then, over time, if you refer to yourself as Mom and Dad, they transition to that too.
