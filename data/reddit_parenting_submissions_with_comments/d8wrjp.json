I definitely would encourage you and your husband to learn more about your hormones and how they will continue to change postpartum. Please know that this isn't forever and with some patience and grace from both of you, your mojo will come back. Idk how far postpartum you are but mine returned around maybe 5 or 6 months (returned, but not quite to normal) and I think that's still considered pretty quick. Having a baby/adding another child changes not only your body, but your life in drastic ways. The adjustments that come with that take time. Breastfeeding in particular can make it hard. I know that for me, a big part of what helped it return was that I had recovered from most of the physical parts of having a child and I had finally found my groove as a mother. I was more confident, had a routine, was able to find a little time for myself, and once I had some time for myself it was easier to prioritize making time for us too. \n\nNow this is all saying it did take time, and we did still have intimate time occasionally when my mojo hadn't returned quite yet, but that was because it was still my marriage and I had to at least try. We would always stop if I felt uncomfortable obviously, but he would often feel better with even just a little bit of touch/attention/cuddles/intimacy and just knowing that I cared enough to try. \n\nPlease give yourself plenty of time. Help your husband (and yourself) learn more about why you may be feeling this way. It doesn't mean you aren't attracted to him anymore, it's just how your body works right now and it will continue to change as well. Remind yourself that even though intimacy is very important in a marriage, so is communication, and that not all intimacy has to be sexual. Don't force yourself to do anything you don't want to to make him feel better, but remember that while you may feel touched out, be may feel ignored and  undeserving of your touch since it all goes to baby now.\n\nAnyway, this has turned into rambling, but this isn't forever! Be patient with yourself and your husband during this time, you'll both find your groove eventually.

So spot-on. It makes me sick when I see the posts about spouses with lowered libido and all the Deadbedrooms folks parade in like \u201cdivorce her you will never be happy in this sexless marriage again!\u201d Yet, so few people (men and women!) understand that sex drive is dependent on a lot of factors, especially for women. For me, it\u2019s always a hormone imbalance thanks to PCOS. If I\u2019m on the pill, I\u2019m fine. Once I\u2019m off the pill for any reason, goodbye sex drive. \n\nI had a similar experience too... ended up having a hysterectomy for cervical cancer and before I was even cleared to have sex again (I had a MAJOR complication two weeks post-op) my ex yelled at me that he would never be happy with our sex life ever again. While I was still recovering. And what was even more strange was that I was always the higher libido spouse prior to having my daughter, and he would be the one turning me down for sex. As soon as he couldn\u2019t have it at the drop of a dime, he became obsessed. It made me realize how horribly selfish he was, and how much he lacked empathy. \n\nAnd those effects are lingering; I found myself getting anxiety when I got off the pill recently and my libido tanked, thinking my husband would be upset and start pressuring me.
