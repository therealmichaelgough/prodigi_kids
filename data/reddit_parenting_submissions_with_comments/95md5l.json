Nurse when baby starts fussing and they probably won't even notice she's there.\n\n- Look at your baby or phone so you don't see the disapproving stares. Alternatively: look around the establishment, act like you're doing nothing wrong.

I'd feed him in the car. I used to park my car in the furthest corner of the lot, or under a tree, or basically anywhere where when I fed my son, the side of the car I was on was obscured. I still caught the occasional glance, but I always told myself it was because I was hanging out in the backseat in a parking lot, not because I was breastfeeding. Which could be true, who knows. I employed this tactic whenever we went anywhere else. I fed him in the parking lot at the mall. We paid and boxed up our food whenever he started getting fussy at a restaurant, just so I could feed him in the car.

The only negative comment I ever received for breastfeeding was at a BBQ at a friend's house... so not exactly public, but not at home either.  Guy walked up behind me craddle nursing my 4 week old son using a nursing tank top (it was July so it super hot!!) and he peered over my shoulder. He then freaked out and said \"I thought he was just sleeping\" and nearly ran out the back door.  He APOLOGIZED to my HUSBAND for looking at me when I was feeding my kid. (Insert huge eye roll here).  My husband responded with \"I don't care if she walks around topless and you see her, she is feeding my baby!\"  (I LOVE that man.) Guy told my Husband that his wife was \"old school\" and only fed their son at home.  Good for her! I'm not stopping my life because  you saw the top of my breast that you would have seen if I was wearing a bikini... the horror! Haha\n\nThe only reactions I got in public were super positive! The one that sticks out in my mind the most was a biker guy came up to me at a coffee shop and said, \"I hope you don't mind me saying this, but I think you're an awesome mother for taking such good care of your baby! I have a grandchild who was born two weeks ago and I just love seeing young mothers out and about feeding their babies. It's beautiful!\"  He was this tough looking, leather wearing biker guy and I was not expecting that at all :)  Now when I am out and about and I see a mother nursing her baby I just smile at her and keep on going about my business... I just hope to send a little positive energy her way to know there are people in public who support her decision to breastfeed in public!

But over time as I got better about it, and could do it without showing the world everything, it became much less of an issue.\n\nI also find it helps to not read into \"looks\" so much - it's easy to think people looking at you are judging you, or think you're gross, or whatever, but I would put good money on it that MOST of the people looking at you probably weren't thinking anything negative, and might have only been noticing and moving on with their day.\n\nI know I've been guilty of accidentally making a mom feel uncomfortable, when I watched her nurse - didn't really mean to but it reminded me of when my first was small, and seeing her nurse was bringing back good memories.  Oops! Mom, wherever you are - you are a good mom and you looked super sweet with your baby!  And OP... consider some people looking may actually feel positively about you. :)\n\nSo anyway, things that helped me be more confident:\n\n- practicing at home in front of a mirror. My kids didn't like covers, so I learned to pull my shirt up and do things in a pretty discreet way (pulling shirts down or having a bare chest always felt awkward to me, ymmv.  I found pulling my shirt up kept my chest covered and made it all easier).\n\n- special nursing tops. Momzelle made a drape-front top that was so discreet I'd have conversations with people for minutes before they realized I was nursing\n\n- making eye contact with people, smiling, etc.  That's how I learned most of the people looking weren't really crappy people, they were just noticing. :)  \n\nIt's fine to seek out quiet spots, etc - baby is less distracted that way and it's more relaxing.  But looking back I feel silly about going to the car, etc.  That said, it just takes some time and experience to get your confidence up.  Remember it's normal.  Most people don't notice, of those who notice most don't really care.

Then there's the issue of your own reaction - potential leaking when baby cries, getting your nursing bra undone with one hand, can you get him latched OK, will you be relaxed enough to let down so he doesn't just pop right off, popping on/off because he's distracted.  Those all take another higher level of confidence to get over, and it's really tough because if you think your baby is going to pop off a bunch, then you'll be scared you'll get more staring/comments from other people.  Feeling scared doesn't make it relaxing, and your letdown reflex and your baby's stress level can both be affected, and you end up feeding him in the car a lot.  I totally wish I was the type who just DGAF, ever, but - I'm not always. The only way to get better is to practice, Try to start with quiet places that aren't very crowded, and only have other moms. Work up to breastfeeding in front of other moms and dads. For me the weirdest/most difficult people to breastfeed in front of were men that I knew well, friends' husbands, my father in law, male co-workers, etc.  I never have been able to breastfeed in front of male co-workers honestly.
