(It was mild but for her she likes flavour not spice), so we gave her a bit more cheese and sour cream and asked her to eat as much as she could, and she did. \n\nI pick her up from nursery and I get told she ate everything, and I always say I am not surprised. \n\nHer unicorn trait is her understanding of concepts at 3. The other day we were driving and she said \"I love going to my friends houses to play, except Johnnys\".\n\nWe pushed it and worked through her train of thought and she meant especially Johnnys. \n\nShe knew what she meant and was finding the words inside her. She can't read, but she has listened to some stories so many times she \"reads\" them to her toys. We have had some friends look in amazement saying, can she read. We have to own up and say no, she just has a phenomenal memory. She forgets nothing, and can correct you if you read one word wrong in a book.\n\nWhat she falls down on at the moment is the fact she is bad at independant play. She always wants to include you in the game. Which we always used to do (our fault, but you want to give them as much time as you can) but now we have her brother, the dynamic has changed and she is not always that great at being self directed. She's great with her brother which is great, but it means he gets left every so often to play on his own. He is so super chilled by everything and she is his favourite person in the whole world I think he will just let her get away with everything.
