When brains  first learn language, they simply connect a sense experience or a bodily experience with a bunch of sounds. What \"language\" that sound group belongs to is irrelevant. So I disagree with establishing one language first. There is no need to translate one language through another. You can simply learn that that thing (say, a tree), is both known as \"tree\" and \"arbre\". Just like cold, chilly, freezing, etc. can all be used to talk about \"cold\". It's perfectly possible to naturally and neurally attach 2 groups of sounds to the brain's mental picture of a tree. \n\nLearning first one language and then translating the second language through the first is actually a retarding (ie. Slowing down) factor in learning either language, and neuroligically unnecessary. There may indeed be a small delay in correct grammar and vocabulary, but it's not overwhelming for the child unless an adult is making them feel stressed and overwhelmed about it.
