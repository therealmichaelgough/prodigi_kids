I gave up because the stress of crying wasn't worth it to me). She didn't sleep through the night until all of her teeth came in. \n\nMy second one was a boob addict. He would wake up 5-6 times a night to nurse and screamed bloody murder if he didn't get his damn boob pacifier. He also had night terrors and is a generally high strung kid. I've never experienced night terrors before, but damn is it freaky. Sitting up in bed and screaming \"no no noooo,\" hands pointing and shaking at some random point in the room or hands to his head and screaming. And god forbid you try to comfort him; he'd kick and flail like he was possessed. He finally started sleeping better at 3.5, but he still wakes up crying at 4.5. But it's sooo much easier to get him back to bed--hug and kiss, and lay him back to bed. \n\nI'm on baby number 3, and he sleeps like crap too. My mom insists I'm not feeding him enough. Some nights he will hive me one 3 hours stretch which is heavenly. Other nights he's up every 1-2 hours or 30-45 minutes. I'm exhausted. Absolutely exhausted. \n\n I know of a couple real unicorn babies that sleep through the night from birth/early on.

She was sooo tired from getting up once a night since she has never had to deal with waking up night for a baby. W. t. F. Her kid genuinely slept on her own and would stay in her crib and play quietly until her mom would get her at 9am. The kid is now 7 and she's really sweet, smart, and just a good kid.
