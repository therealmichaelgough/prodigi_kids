They will also collect any arrears (back owed child support).\n\nSecond, the 1 year old will not remember their birthday party, it is mostly for family...really.  Bake some cupcakes, and take some pictures.  My idea of a birthday party is VERY cheap.  This is what we do:\n\n* $5 - I bake a cake, or cupcakes.  I let my daughter pick the flavor (yay baking aisle at the grocery store!) and frosting.\n* $0 - Balloons? don't need them.  We're in a [global helium shortage](http://www.livescience.com/38990-looming-helium-shortage.html) anyway, so you're being...ugh...conscientious!\n* $10/pizza - Costco Pizza!  Cheap and serves lots of folks! (you do not need a membership for this btw)\n* $1/bottle - Drinks? Store brand 2L or 3L bottles.  No one cares!\n* $6/500 plates, $5/100 cups, $1.50/roll paper towels - Pick up a pack of cheapo plates and cups at costco (or walmart!)while you're there.  Don't forget plenty of napkins (bring a roll or two of papertowels)!\n* $0 online - Make some invites, you can use plain paper.  Print them (keep it simple) OR if you have everyone's email addresses, use eVite (free to make, and no postage).\n\nAssuming you have about 20 people at the party, this would run you about 1 cake mix, 3 pizzas, 2 bottles of soda, 1 set of \"fine china\" = $50.\n\nToo much?  cut out the pizza ($30 in my estimate, so your party would run you around $20), just have a \"cake and punch\" party.  You are not obligated to serve everyone, just have it at a non-meal time (like 1-4pm), it is TOTALLY etiquette correct to do this, hell it used to be extremely common to have a wedding reception like this, so I'm pretty sure a b-day party would be totally fine.\n\nYOU DO NOT NEED TO HAVE FAVORS, but if you really feel like you do, pick up a roll of stickers.  Kids don't need that much, really!  Teach them that the party is about celebrating their life, not about stuff.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nYour gift is the party, everyone else will bring their own gifts for your kid.
