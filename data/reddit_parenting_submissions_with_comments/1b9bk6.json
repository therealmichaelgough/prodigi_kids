My problem is with **disciplining him, and getting time for myself.**\n\nHe does not like solids much, as he knows that he will get breast milk any time. But not having solids makes him hungry and cranky, and I cannot afford to have him at the breast all the time. I don\u2019t wear him, as I have a bad back. \n\nHe is very clingy, and he wakes up the moment I do, and needs to be carried around after that. Our mornings are a rush, so it is hard to get things done while carrying a big baby around. I pee, poo and brush while holding him and nursing him and that makes him slightly better while saving me time. But I need to cook and pack food too, and I can\u2019t hold him when I do.\n\nHe goes to a daycare from 9 to 6, which is good for my sanity. But the moment I pick him up at 6 PM, he cries for boob, so I nurse him in the car. I suspect that fills him up, so he doesn\u2019t want to eat dinner at all, gets angry and throws food around, till I give up n nurse him. But he nurses for ages, and sometimes he doesn\u2019t fall asleep, so the half hour or one and a half hours I spent awake in bed doing nothing were a waste. \n\nI realized that I can\u2019t have even a little bit of chocolate, or his sleep is affected. Coffee seems okay, the effects do not last as long as for chocolate. I need to throw out the granola bars that I bought without knowing they had chocolate \u2013 it is too tempting to have it if it is in sight.\n\nSometimes I make him sleep and change my shirt, and put my old shirt near him. This way I can go finish my task without him waking up. I go in and periodically swap my shirt so that he can still smell me near him.\nMy questions:\n\n\n2.\t**How do I make mealtime easier?** He eats well at the daycare.  Yesterday I drove back home from daycare without nursing him in the car, and he cried murder for a few minutes, and was fine. And we distracted him by taking him to the park afterward, so he was hungry enough at dinner time. I doubt we can take him to the park every day, especially with the crazy weather in my place.\n\n1.\t**How do I make nap times easier?** How can we get him to sleep if I am not around to nurse him? My family is pressuring me to stop breastfeeding since my life now revolves around nursing him, and also since by not sleep training him, I am inconveniencing the rest of my family who have to step in and help. He sleeps at the daycare, because the lady is kind enough to make him sleep on her shoulder, and she\u2019s experienced enough to make it work. In the last two weeks she could transition him from her shoulder to her bed near her, but not to his nap mat. My family has not been able to do it.\n\n3.\tHe is basically clingy because my parents left a fortnight back, and he went nuts at home cause he was always surrounded by people and now there was only me. So he is still clingy and cries when I leave him at the daycare, and cries at home if I am doing something else. **How do Imake him feel more secure?**\n\n4.\tUnrelated to breastfeeding: The daycare provider mixes honey and lemons in his water, to make him drink more water. It is as sweet as lemonade. Should I ask her to dilute it further? I**\u2019m concerned about him having sweets**, but thought honey is good since it is natural, but I\u2019d like it to be in moderation too.\n\n\n\n\n----\n\nUpdate: since he came down with a fever on Friday evening, I've been nursing him kinda non stop and giving him lots of attention. He still is cranky in the morning (and through the night, thats a new problem but hopefully is temporary), but otherwise he's fine, and loving the attention. He even was comfortable to leave my side and go play in the daycare, when I left him. Usually he clings to my side and cries when I leave. I think the loads of attention did go him good for once. I'm going to incorporate all your suggestions in the future.

I found even though she was with dad while I was at work she was very clingy to nurse and woke up very suddenly if I rolled over in bed and wouldn't go back to sleep until she nursed. So she was only getting 8 hours of sleep at night and maybe 1 or 2 hours of nap (if she would go). This made her very clingy and didn't want to eat much either in the morning. I eventually had to let her cry it out in her crib, but she only cried for 10 minutes the first time. And by day 4 no crying at all. Once she learned to self soothe, she stopped asking for the breast and she weaned herself. Her mood improved and she became a bit more independent (but not distant by any means). She now sleeps 10 or 11 hours a night with no wake ups and naps for 2 or 3 hours (some days she doesn't nap but I think it's due to teething). All babies are different. Cosleeping is awesome and I wouldn't have done it any other way, but by the time she was 16 months old it stopped working for us. Breast feeding is always a tough one too, it's such an amazing thing and some babies don't want to let go. I guess I don't have any actual advice, just sharing my experience. I didn't have any friends who breastfed anywhere near as long as me so I had little advice. 'Throw them in the crib and they'll fall asleep' was the only one and it actually worked, but I know that I got lucky. And I was super lucky she weaned herself. I think she asked for it once (momma, a bub?) and I was like 'no baby, big girls don't bub, want a cup of milk?' And that was the end of it.

My 15 month old is almost exactly the same. \n\nEatings been super difficult, but I've found out some things that worked for me. I chew up whatever I'm eating till its kinda pur\u00e9ed, then spit. It onto my finger and hell eat that. I've also taken bananas, frozen strawberries and milk, mixed them in a blender and let him practice drinking that from a straw. I've been putting ice cold water into a sippy cup for him and have him drink that any time he's thirsty. It's gotten to the point where he only nurses when he naps or is cranky. I also give him boiled carrot strips which he seems to like. Give him food he can experiment with, like boiled broccoli, carrots, or other soft but firm foods. Let him learn food is fun, and he'll enjoy eating. Remember that kids this age are picky eaters, so don't get stressed if he doesn't eat a lot everyday. besides, he's still getting nourishment from breastfeeding so it's not the end of the world if he doesn't eat more than a bite of solids a day. You can also make freeze pops of the fruit smoothie thing I mentioned earlier for him to suck on if his teeth hurt too bad from teething. You can even pump breast milk and make the Popsicles out of that. Walmart is selling the freeze pop makers for like $3 right now. My son loves them.\n\nI still haven't figured the nap thing. I basically set up a laptop next to my bed and surf the web while he naps on me. I've changed his sleeping schedule from Awake 2hrs &gt; Nap &gt; Awake 3hrs &gt; Nap &gt; Awake 4hrs &gt; Bed to Awake 2hrs &gt; Nap &gt; Awake 3hrs &gt; Nursing Session &gt; Awake 4hrs &gt; Bed which has helped cut back on how long I'm stuck in bed, but on days where his teeth are killing him I go back to the old nap schedule. \n\nMy sons super clingy now too. It's just the age they're at. Not much you can do but get through it. Remember that he nurses for comfort too, and sometimes uses it as reassurance that you're there for him and that everything is okay. It'll go away eventually, and when it's gone you'll miss it, but for now just power through. If I have to do dishes, or make dinner, I put him in his high chair, give him a spatula, and sing to him. Sometimes it doesn't work and he still cries. Just calmly explain that you're doing something that has to be done and hell have to wait. Babies/toddlers cry. It sucks, but just give him a big hug whenever you can, but be firm about him having to wait. \n\nI would tell her you're uncomfortable with how sweet it is, and ask she just give him plain water. \n\nAbove all, don't let people pressure you into quitting breastfeeding if you don't want to. It's great for you and him, and it'll help you both a lot in the long run.\n\nI have to go but feel free to pm me if you need anymore help.", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1364595179, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "c94vnsj", "link_id": "t3_1b9bk6", "parent_id": "t3_1b9bk6", "removal_reason": null, "retrieved_on": 1431736014, "score": 5, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"archived": true, "author": "Catbunny", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "Can you pump and start giving him bottles?", "controversiality": 1, "created_utc": 1364596468, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "c94w1es", "link_id": "t3_1b9bk6", "parent_id": "t3_1b9bk6", "removal_reason": null, "retrieved_on": 1431735836, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"archived": true, "author": "allididwasdie", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "Exactly what I was thinking.

If he isn't interested in what you are offering, he doesn't get anything else. They need to learn that. Throwing food around is pretty normal at 15 months old. Just stay consistent in telling him that it isn't nice to throw food. If he continues after a few warning, take it away.\n\nAgain, for naps you need a schedule. Put him in his crib at the same time everyday. Allow him to sleep as long as he wants, but keep the routine the same. If he doesn't sleep, leave him in there for a specific duration just for quiet time. Since there isn't really a routine set right now, he may cry. There are various ways to handle it.
