When the kids become potty trained they move up to the next class. All her friends were moving on and she finally was ready. \n\nI'm in the midst of potty training my son right now. But getting rid of his pacifier was tough. He was really attached. I tried taking it away cold turkey because that's what everyone always says to do, but it was a disaster. I realized I needed a different approach. I noticed that sometimes he really pays attention to what I say to him. I also realized his pacifier provided comfort and security and that he was going to need time to process letting go of them. So I prepped him for a month about how pacifiers are special helpers that come to help babies sleep. And when you turn 2, they go back to pacifier land because you're a big a boy and don't need them anywhere. I reminded him every day for a month or so until I came home with toys and a lollipop and a balloon. He \"turned in\" his pacifiers for the toys and lollipops. He said goodbye to the pacifiers and we tied them to the balloons and watched them go bye bye and he never asked for a pacifier again and was fine. \n\nMaybe you could do something similar with your daughter. Her diapers may provide a sense of security for her and letting go of the may be really scary for her. Let her know that her time with diapers is coming to an end and let her enjoy her last few weeks with her diapers and just keep reminding her of what's coming up, that diapers are for babies who can't use the potty and now that she's a big girl, she doesn't need them anymore and the diapers go bye Bye. Then she can trade her diapers for big girl undies and some treats and you can go from there. \n\nLots of good advice in this thread, will be saving....good luck!", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1456021246, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "d07oyed", "link_id": "t3_46sl0e", "parent_id": "t3_46sl0e", "retrieved_on": 1458633287, "score": 22, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"author": "shaleesmo", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "Very neat ideas, that's a clever approach.

Your story resonated with me a lot -- I too have tried treat rewards, sticker charts, consistent reminders yada yada, but she simply cries if I withhold diapers from her. However, here's how I have made peace with the process: 1) I constantly remind myself that she's little, that her world is big and scary, that she's had to cope with several MAJOR life changes in the past year (a move, a sibling, and a disabled mother), that where she pees/poops is one area that she can exert some control, and that diapers feel safe to her. 2) She is almost a clone of her 10yo cousin, and he too was almost 4 before he potty trained. His mother reassures me that one night he simply refused to wear a diaper, saying he didn't need them anymore, and never had an accident after that, even at night. \n\nMy daughter is starting preschool next month, and I believe that the peer pressure might just encourage the process along. But I've resolved that, other than talking *non-judgmentally* about body functions in general and pointing out when others use the restroom, I'm not going to push her. If she gets a UTI from holding it because she's scared to go anywhere but in a diaper, that will only delay the process, and potentially make her even more fearful of urinating.

I peed in the potty!\" \n\nWe left diapers behind that day. However, the battle was only half over. She has a serious aversion to public toilets because of the noise level.

One day, we went on a day trip. Started out in the morning and didn't come home until that evening. \n\nShe had several opportunities to pee but refused.

The automatic hand dryers are the devil's spawn, and the auto-flush toilets are the worst. Also, she has specific toilets in town that she prefers because they're familiar and quiet. If you have to run errands and know you'll be out for a while, be sure to stop by those places. You will be surprised at the choices she makes. My daughter prefers the bathrooms in the oldest supermarket in town with ancient toilets because they are quiet, whereas she will absolutely never set foot in a fancy-schmancy McDonald's or WalMart bathroom because of the loud, echoey noises in them. \n\nYou've probably also noticed some other sensory issues like spinning and a higher-than-normal level of activeness.

Plus, without the underwear, she'll really feel that unpleasant sensation of pee dripping down her leg. Also, we figured out that our kid really just wanted privacy. He couldn't do it with me all up in his business, so I stopped prompting him unless it's been more than 30 min or we're about to leave the house. I leave the bathroom light on now and he goes in there on his own to pee. He was reluctant to poop in the potty at first, he'd dance around the house &amp; try several times w/out success and then say his tummy hurt. The first couple days it mostly ended up on the floor, but once I left him alone &amp; gave him privacy he did fine. We ditched all the diapers at one time and took on night training along with day training, so there are no mixed messages. He sleeps in his PJs but no underwear. We wake him up at about 11pm to pee on the potty &amp; he goes back to sleep. This technique is from the book \"Oh Crap, Potty Training\" which I downloaded for about $11 and it has worked wonders for us, I highly recommend it! As for the loud flushing, my kid was afraid of public restrooms for so long because of that, so we avoided them and changed his diapers in the car. When he was getting closer to potty training we started taking him into public restrooms with us anyway, as a sort of \"exposure therapy\" (because I was tired of holding it when I needed to go!) He cried but I tried to ignore it and show him that I was calm &amp; we were not in danger. When he was old enough to understand, I taught him how to cover his ears while I used the hand dryer.

Because they process thing different then normal kids so you have to teach them differently.\n   my son by no means looks autistic or would at first glace be thought of as such,he super smart can see and notices thing almost nobody caches,(just like dad). likes to talk about things that he enjoys and has good grades.now that he is in 2nd grade and 8 1/2yr has medication for the adhd and is going to a center that teaches kids like him how to socialize properly he has had a great year only 1-2 melt down this HOLE year. last year was at least 1-2 a day in school.just by understanding him and how to teach him how and why he should only do certain things has gone a long way. the school is amazed at how much of change has happened in only one year after we started treatment. \n   So you say that your child screams to have a diaper and holds it till she is about to burst send HUGE SIGNALS that shes not like every kid and everything you try will most likely not work. i would start by putting her back in diapers making an appointment with a  Psychologists doctor asap. reading and reviewing autistic type behavior to see if anything lines up with your child. watch her closely on how she act in different setting and maybe even taking note on how she handle different things such as    \n injury(overreacting over a scratch),\n noises(different sounds in pitch) \n lights (brightness) \n different sounds at (higher levels)\n how she play with toys such as throwing them when mad or hitting them trying to force thing that don't fit.  \n all these types of things cant help lead to understanding why she dose not want to use a toilet. realistically sounds like anxiety by trying to force potty training she may now see it as a stresser but hard for me to say. i do know there are children that go till there teens before they can cope with using a toilet.similar to such issues as people how cant use public toilets. hope this opens you eyes to do your research and don't wastes your time with a general doctor they will just give you a BS answer any way. good luck and let me know how it works out.", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1458290686, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "d14bdg8", "link_id": "t3_46sl0e", "parent_id": "t3_46sl0e", "retrieved_on": 1460722507, "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}]}
