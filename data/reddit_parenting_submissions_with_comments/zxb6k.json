I just don\u2019t understand him at all. He has always smoked, I knew this when I met him.  He encouraged me to smoke and I did for about five years. When we decided to try for a baby we agreed together to stop smoking and with difficulty I stopped. He said that it was harder for him because he had been smoking for longer. I said ok just do your best.  I became pregnant. He smoked all throughout the pregnancy (outside) and would even offer me cigarettes. I declined obviously.      \n    He then stopped for about four months. When he restarted I was disappointed in him but resigned to the fact that it was his life. I was breastfeeding our son but he continuously offered me cigarettes to try and get me to resume smoking. I totally accept that it is pointless to nag/ask him to stop. He gets very angry and snappy with me if I dare mention it.  \nNow here is the problem \u2013 He has no life insurance. He has been smoking 20+ a day for about 20 years and REFUSES to get life insurance. I have begged him to get insurance. I am terrified that he will get cancer and leave my 19 month old son and I with no money.  \n    This may sound selfish but I do not want to raise my child alone and in poverty, especially not in poverty. We do not live on the bread line and he could afford life insurance. I myself have a sizable policy should the worst happen to me. I tried to take out a policy for my husband but they needed the name of his doctor. He has no doctor. \n     I think you know where I am going with this. He refuses to register with a doctor and will not give me his NHS number so I have no way of signing him up. We live in England so it is not as if it will cost him anything to sign up. Last week he insinuated that if he had insurance I would have him \u201cbumped off\u201d. \n    I\u2019m fed up. Not only does he smell like an ash tray, cough all the time and leave piles of tobacco around the house he refuses to protect our sons future. What can I do? Is there any way I can insure him without access to his medical information??\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Husband won't get life insurance or stop smoking.", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/zxb6k/husband_wont_get_life_insurance_or_stop_smoking/", "user_reports": []}, "comments": [{"archived": true, "author": "earthpeesfire", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "You have to wait for him to come around, sadly.
