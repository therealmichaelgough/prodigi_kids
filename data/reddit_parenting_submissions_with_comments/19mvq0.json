Define \"cannot breastfeed.\" I could not breastfeed (breast tissue anatomy made latch attempts nightmarish + daughter was in NICU her first week of life) and pumped milk instead for 6 months and had to supplement starting in month 5 because my daughter was drinking more than I could produce and a surgery around month 7 cause me to have to wean her off breast milk completely. Formula feeding was very liberating as I was not a full-time stay at home mom and pumping was awkward at work. However, would you lump working moms in with \"cannot breastfeed\" or \"choose not to?\" Is your definition only for moms who due to anatomy or production cannot do it? I really don't see how the \"choice\" factor is a different topic. It is a true rare circumstance the mom who literally cannot breastfeed/pump.\n\nAlso, to counter your argument that why the posters are targeting low socio-economic is because they \"don't know\" about the benefits is not fully true. Yes, it is trying to target them (I noticed way more posters at the county health clinic than my OB's office or the hospital in which I delivered). However, many of them are also working one or two jobs (many of which might only have a public breakroom or bathrooms), might be a single mom, etc and the WIC program helps take the edge off of a reason people would NOT want to use formula: the cost. These posters are just trying to get them to try harder because it is \"better\" without really addressing why it is harder for them in the first place (have to go back to work earlier, less support at home, easier access with WIC, etc). \n\n\nAt any rate, yes, it would be great if everyone gave a good hearty effort toward breastfeeding, but ultimately there are a number of factors at play, not only convenience. I'd rather have a mom use formula and focus on her mental health and well-being than go through the nightmare that can be breastfeeding. Not everyone has the time or energy to pump like I did; I was lucky enough to be able to take off 8 weeks of work and then only work for 2 days a week in the office until after my surgery when I went back 4 days a week and daughter was fully weaned at that point. \n\n\nBottom line, if you want to use formula, just do it, and don't dwell on it.

I felt so judged and pressured by the nurses during my struggles with feeding and wish this stuff wasn't so deeply tied to our feelings of self worth as mothers. That being said, In the 50's and 60's babies were bundled in blankets, put in a basket and stuck in the back of the car instead of having baby seats. Children and adults alike did not wear seat belts. The vast majority of these babies and children grew up just fine and healthy. We know that the increased use of seat belts and introduction of baby seats significantly reduced injury and death among people and children though. I see the breastfeeding and formula debate much the same way. We know that breastfeeding reduces SIDS deaths, and the general number of illnesses in babies. That doesn't mean that formula causes these things, just that the babies chances are improved. If someone cant breastfeed or finds it extremely difficult with their life to do so, ok fine your child will probably be fine. But, to suggest that because it hurts someone feelings to be told that breast milk (or car seats) are better for their child that they shouldn't be told is simply unfair to all mothers. I would like to know every way possible to reduce my childs chances of dying. I can't take all the precautions in the world as much as I'd like to, I'm just doing the best I can do. But, we need to separate our emotions from facts in this because it sounds like several people want to say formula feeding is equally as good as breast feeding, which is factually not true. It doesn't make formula evil (it's a frickin life saver, where would we be without it? I have 6 friends who are recent mothers and 3 couldn't produce enough milk so use formula) but it does mean that if you are informed about the benefits of breast milk most people would expect you to at least try to do it to increase your babies chance at better health.

I took fenugreek, milk thistle, I was pumping and hand expressing almost constantly. I ate all the 'best breast' foods and beverages - trying to get my milk back for my son. No go. My boobs just wouldn't do it. My doctor had no clue how to help, we had tried everything. So, I switched to formula when my son was about 3 months old (the fenugreek allowed me to carry on breastfeeding a little longer, thankfully). Before formula feeding, I was a huge breast-feeding advocate. I attended le leche league meetings. I breastfed in public places to make a point. I convinced other mothers to breast feed. It was some sort of sick karma that my breasts decided to stop producing milk. I was mad at myself, and the very posters your talking about -started to bother me. Yah, breast is best.... but only if you're breasts are willing and able. The rest of us fall by the wayside. I think it's important to encourage breastfeeding - but maybe we should also encourage being less judgmental of other mothers and their choices. I mean, I've been judged by friends and strangers alike for numerous parenting things - and I've judged other mothers as well.\n\n I've sat around the mum circle outside of daycare and participated in the \"Did you hear that she lets her son watch horror movies with her?! He's only six!\" and the \"Well you know he's like that because she never disciplines him. He's so spoiled. I would never let my child get away with that behavior\" and even some \"I worry for those kids. Maybe someone should call social services. Not me.... but someone should.\" Yah, I've heard it all. I didn't stand up and tell those mums that it's wrong, either. I am horrible, just like every other mom. Maybe - if we want to stop feeling hurt by the messages on posters, we should decide as a people (mothers) - to stop judging one another? \n\nCalling someone a bad parent, doesn't make you a good parent. Talking behind a mom's back about her parenting style, doesn't mean that you are a better parent than her. Not at all. Not even a little bit. The reason we do this, is because we are TERRIFIED by our job. We hold the position of being solely responsible for the life of a human being - caring for it, shaping it, helping it grow. It's the scariest job there is. If we fuck up, we don't get fired - we ruin a life. Each and every one of us can think back on a moment when we didn't do our best. When we were tired and stressed out and instead of being understanding of our tantruming toddler we yelled a little too loud. Maybe we pushed them towards their room a little too hard. Maybe we didn't get them lunch right on time and they spent a few minutes hungry and crying. Maybe we layed in bed in the morning lying to ourselves and saying 'no, he's not crying. I can't hear him crying. I am just going to sleep a little longer...' The fact is - our job is HARD, and we don't get vacations or days off. Not for 18 years, anyways. Of course we are going to make mistakes, and doubt ourselves, and not be the perfect amazing mothers that we hoped we'd be. We aren't going to be our best, 100% of the time. We are going to make mistakes. BUT, judging each other - at the end of the day - won't make those mistakes go away. I know you, we, I - all worry that we are bad mums. We do. Even though we know that we aren't, we still - sometimes - worry. That worry is normal and natural and fine..... but blaming other mothers for their mistakes so that we can feel better about our own, is not normal. It's mean. It's cheap. It's easy. It's wrong. It hurts us all in turn, because you can bet that if you are judging someone else - there's someone out there judging you, and none of us are perfect.\n\nJust, something to think about.", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1362420689, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "c8pldxt", "link_id": "t3_19mvq0", "parent_id": "t3_19mvq0", "removal_reason": null, "retrieved_on": 1435575227, "score": 6, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"archived": true, "author": "kimberlyann0507", "author_flair_css_class": "purple", "author_flair_text": "Mommy to 3 girls 8, 5 and 1 with one on the way", "body": "My question is this: if you can breastfeed and choose not to why is that?

I did not share your experience myself; I had a natural, vaginal birth and was able to breastfeed my little girl with few complications that were, in any case, eventually overcome.  But I do sympathize with feeling judged.  I was judged and criticized by plenty of people for: choosing not to learn the baby's sex before the birth, not scheduling a C-Section, choosing not to have pain killers during the birth, for breastfeeding, for supplementing my milk with formula, for not bedecking my baby girl in pink frills and Disney Princesses \"now that you know what you got\", for nursing her until she was a year and a half, for only starting potty training now that she's almost two and a half... and the list will get longer the older she gets.  People are quick to judge, especially when it comes to your parenting choices.  What they don't understand is that all parenting \"choices\" aren't always chosen.  My sister-in-law wanted to breast feed her baby so badly, but she was diagnosed with breast cancer when she was 38 weeks along and had to have a mastectomy and begin chemotherapy shortly after giving birth, preventing her from breastfeeding.  In her case, not breastfeeding probably saved her life.  And heaps of scorn were piled on this poor woman by people who did not know her circumstances for not breastfeeding.  It upset her, but she learned to brush it off.  \nThe medical establishment knows that, generally speaking and barring unusual circumstances, mother's milk is best for infants because of the ease with which it is digested, the natural antibodies that are imparted to the infant, and the bonding between baby and mother that often results from successful breastfeeding.  it is also known that many women don't breastfeed because they find it inconvenient, or gross, or they just don't understand how beneficial it usually is.  But what is ultimately best for baby is a happy mother who provides love, comfort, care, shelter, and nourishment that is as healthful as possible, whether that nourishment comes from a can or from momma's own body.   \nPeople will judge you.  Regardless of what you do for your baby, even if it's what you must do for the benefit of your baby and yourself, they will judge you.  But they don't know you, and they don't know your reasons for parenting the way that you do and their condemnation can and should be disregarded as the blathering of fools.  If they are people with whom you are familiar and they are familiar with your circumstances and they still judge you, their condemnation can and should be disregarded as the blathering of malicious fools.\nThis is what matters: \nAre you happy?\nIs your baby happy?\nAre you healthy?\nIs your baby healthy?\nDo you have love and support from somebody who genuinely cares about you and your baby?\n\nThe rest is just details.\nDon't let the haters get you down.\n\n", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1362428609, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "c8po406", "link_id": "t3_19mvq0", "parent_id": "t3_19mvq0", "removal_reason": null, "retrieved_on": 1431481270, "score": 6, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"archived": true, "author": "zikronix", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "We have this problem right now, my wife just can't produce enough to feed our hungry man.

During my pregnancy, I never even *considered* formula feeding. It just wasn't an option, in my eyes. There was no reason I should formula feed when I'm right here, this healthy, young, fertile woman with generous breasts. All the literature, all the people in my life, everyone agreed: breast is best! I was going to be a responsible mom and feed my child rich, nutritious breastmilk. He would get the best. He would receive all these wonderful benefits and antibodies and grow big and strong and and healthy, the natural way. All those bottles I received from people would just sit and collect dust.\n\nAnd then I delivered. And then I tried to latch him on. Within 12 hours of delivery, my nipples had turned a dark plum color from bruising. Within 18 hours, even narcotics couldn't shut out the pain, and my nipples were bleeding. Not cracked: I mean outright dripping blood. And within 24 hours, I couldn't bear to have him on my breast at all. The pain was worse than contractions, worse than the birth. It was the worst pain of my life. We tried everything: lanolin, nipple shields, every position in the book. Nothing worked. He was so hungry that he clamped down hard every single time. \n\nIt cumulated in me crying hysterically in the hospital bed while desperately holding a pacifier in my son's mouth to hold him off just a little longer. My SO took him from me and told me that enough was enough: we needed some formula, and we needed it now. My MIL held me as I cried over my failure. I had failed as a mother: breast is best, after all. Why couldn't I give him the best? I was choosing to give him sub-par food. I was choosing a path that wasn't the best. Even a week after delivery, I still tried over and over again to get him to latch. I tried to pump, desperate to give him the best. But it was of no use: my milk all but dried up as soon as my engorgement ended, and he had long since forgotten how to even attempt a latch, let alone a good one.\n\nI don't read the formula cans anymore.

My OB induced me a couple of days before my due date so that the risk of seizure would be reduced and so I would have constant monitoring. After 24 hours of labor from the start of the induction I was only at 5 cm and had been for 6 hours. The epidural failed, I felt everything. OB got concerned that I wasn't dilating and said that it would be advisable to have a C-section because he thought my daughter's head was pushing down on my cervix and preventing it from dilating. As she was born it was discovered she had her umbilical cord wrapped around her neck twice. \n\nAfter 4 days in the hospital we went home. 6 days post-pardum my supply had dropped and I ended up in the ER with an infected incision. My supply never went back up. I would produce at most an ounce with regular pumping. My poor little girl was so hungry, and dehydrated that when she was 6 days old she had been SCREAMING for several hours. We had her 1st post hospital appointment with her doctor that day and he told me I looked horrible and needed to go see my OB and we needed to give her some formula because she was really dehydrated. \n\nOB sent me to the ER over the phone and I nearly fainted several times walking across the street from their offices to the ER. We didn't have formula at all in the house, and the bottles we had were at home. My husband took our daughter to the store down the road, picked up some formula and water, and fed her a bottle in the car. She ate 3 ounces and fell asleep. I was in the ER (didn't want a 6 day old in the ER unless she was the patient) and was treated for cellulitis and I cried feeling like the worst mother ever. \n\nBetween the infection, the antibiotics (I couldn't feed my daughter the breast milk that had antibiotics in it so I pumped and dumped) my anti-convulsants my breast milk supply was close to almost nothing. I tried so hard to get it back up. She is 6 months old now and I still produce a few drops at a time but nothing more. \n\nI read wonderful stories about moms that EBF until this age when solids are started. I wish my daughter could have been one of those babies. Reading articles about how C-section babies don't get the same healthy bacteria in the intestines as vaginal birth babies do and it does more harm than good makes me weep.

It took me a few days to really get rallied up about this, but its so unfair.\n\nTwo things. First, breastmilk really is the ideal food for infants. It's just a fact. It isn't meant to be a judgment call on anyone who can't or doesn't breastfeed. Second, for literally decades, formula companies convinced doctors to convince mothers that their breast milk was \"too thin\" and that their kids weren't growing enough and encouraged them to make the switch. Most kids in my mom and dad's generation were formula fed; it's just what was done. But now that the research has been carried out and we know that actually, breastmilk is best and that it's normal for it to look thin, they have a lot of work to do to counter the damage that was done to public opinion where breastfeeding is concerned. It takes a long time to change people's minds. And there are also a lot of people who just don't know either way - these posters are designed to inform people who don't already know.\n\n&gt;I feel judged when buying formula, or anytime I tell people my baby is formula fed.\n\nAnd I think that stinks! People can be really rude and judgmental about these things. What you feed your baby is nobody else's business. But people have a tendency to think that the way that's best for them must also be best for everyone else, and to judge those who differ.\n\nI'm sorry you couldn't breastfeed...every mom I've known who tried and couldn't all said the same thing - that they found it really upsetting. It doesn't mean you failed though, and anyone who thinks it makes you less of a mom is an asshat. Formula these days is way healthier than what it used to be - it's pretty darn good. What matters more than anything else is that you are feeding your kid and not letting her starve. Don't let people make you feel judged. You're not doing anything wrong. You don't owe anybody an explanation. She's your kid and it's your choice.", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1362598567, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "c8qx0mm", "link_id": "t3_19mvq0", "parent_id": "t3_19mvq0", "removal_reason": null, "retrieved_on": 1431502828, "score": 2, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "[deleted]", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1362602672, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "c8qyff9", "link_id": "t3_19mvq0", "parent_id": "t1_c8qusrh", "removal_reason": null, "retrieved_on": 1431503499, "score": 2, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"archived": true, "author": "knownaspirate", "author_flair_css_class": "blue", "author_flair_text": "Matt Alexander 11/19/12", "body": "I had a similar situation.
