Little unnecessary back story, lately my S.O kept carrying on about what he was going to do for his mom, gifts he was getting, etc. That's fine and all, but he kind of throws me off track because he constantly mentions how his mom left &amp; never raised him, acts rude towards her, etc.. fast forward 20 years, she moves 5 minutes away from us, from states away. So I jokingly ask, \"What are you getting me?\" He looks at me &amp; replies \"a hug\" I honestly was a bit shocked! But laughed it off &amp; looked at my 8 month old &amp; said, \"I pushed you out naturally, for a hug dude\" To which the S.O says \"It's HIS job to get you something\".  I wasn't really hurt, but more surprised at his lack of effort &amp; how serious he was. His mother &amp; I get along well, so there's no issue there! It just genuinely made me curious how you guy's S.O take on the holiday. \nThanks for the chat!
