And if possible, only after letting baby try it out at a friends house or at a store. The reason babies can be so expensive is that before we have them, we've read a bunch of books and magazines and asked people what they need. All of them have different answers and the reality is, until your in the situation, you don't know. Even from birth they have their distinct personalities, and so do you and your sig-o. I think back to our highchair and stroller purchases. We bought 5 high hairs, not because we needed them, but because we were trying to find the right fit for our situation. First we were given a full-on high chair, it was used, frustrating and we couldn't quickly assemble it for feeding so we bought a new full-on high chair. That was ok, but there entered a nanny share and needed a highchair for her at the other families house. It had to be carted around on Monday and Friday cause we rotated houses for the share. So we bought one that strapped onto a dining chair. Then I found a deal on those restaurant style. So we picked up 2 of those so we could have something a bit nicer for a longer time and no longer needed to schlep the strap on one anymore, yay! So 5 highchairs in 2 years, that was awesome. Yes we sold them all when done with each but so annoying none the less.\n\nStrollers weren't much better. We bought a bob, for good reason. We don't own a car live where it snows a lot and while they do plow, the sidewalk ramps always get plowed in. We had to have something to get through snow on foot. I didn't want to wear my daughter when it was Ivey or schlepping groceries home. So yup, we bought the SUV of strollers. Then we wanted something light for summer but not a 20 crappy umbrella. Ended up with a nice one that an airline broke, then had to buy a new one to replace that.\n\nRide on toys, bouncers, walkers, bikes trikes, balls, toys, it's impossible to know what will actually be comfortable, engaging etc. take your time, you don't have to buy everything at once.
