The second he so much as whined, he was being held out for me to take him back. So if you offer help, make sure it's *help* and not \"help.\" If you're sitting on the couch and mom is doing anything but resting or relaxing, you're not *helping*, you're visiting. If you do wind up visiting, know when to leave. Having guests over just adds to my stress level.\n\nI can't tell you how grateful I am when my MIL comes over once in a while after I've worked a graveyard to watch my son for a few hours. She'll come over at 8, take him, and tell me to go to bed. I won't hear a peep from either of them until noon, and my god, I sleep like a *rock*. I'll wake up and she's done my dishes and moved some laundry around, and my son is happy as a clam. I don't ask her to do any of the cleaning or anything; she just does it automatically because she knows we get swamped and she's been there. I did the same thing for her when she did chemo. It makes a huge difference, even if it's just a couple little chores. Living in a messy house stresses people out, and you can easily be overwhelmed by everyday tasks.\n\nSo yes. I'd say above all else, genuine help is the best. People can usually acquire things like robes and PJs over time, but *stuff* won't fold laundry, wash dishes, or mop the floors. Babies are exhausting, and if baby turns out to be very attention-hungry, she might not have the time or energy to get things done ((mine, no joke, has a screaming meltdown if he even *sees* a vacuum or mop.))
