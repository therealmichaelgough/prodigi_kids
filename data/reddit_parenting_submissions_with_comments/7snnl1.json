I\u2019m pregnant my first time and was wondering...how soon can you travel (baby or no baby) after giving birth?\n\nI\u2019m hoping to travel since my sister\u2019s destination wedding is about eight months away and my due date is two weeks before:\n\nIt\u2019s a VERY small intimate destination wedding and a wedding has always been something that\u2019s insanely important to her. She\u2019s always been obsessed with weddings and I could tell she was a bit disappointed when I didn\u2019t have a wedding but threw a local, low key anniversary party instead. And my family and I have been waiting for it to happen for nearly a decade so it\u2019s very exciting for it to finally happen. She\u2019s already gotten party planners doing everything and sent the Save the Dates just this week. She\u2019s known about my pregnancy the day I found out last year but I\u2019ve not felt ok asking her to change the date since it\u2019s really her big day.\n\nMy family is quite close knit and have already expressed dismay that her only sibling won\u2019t be there. A few cousins even told me it\u2019d be unthinkable to not have their only sibling at their weddings. She\u2019s encouraging me to fly anyway and my in-laws say it\u2019s possible, albeit unlikely I\u2019ll want to. My own parents don\u2019t like the idea at all. I\u2019m also worried how gross I\u2019ll feel and the last thing I\u2019ll want to do is go to a fancy wedding...but this is my first pregnancy and I just don\u2019t know.

If your birth is at all complicated, you may still be healing (my very minimal stitches from my beautifully easy labor were just about healed by 2 weeks, barely). You will still be bleeding, and too much activity (walking around an airport) will cause you to bleed more. If you're nursing, your boobs will probably be a leaky mess, not to mention painful. You may not be comfortable nursing in public yet, and a plane can be VERY public. \n\nNot to mention germs+baby... Ehhh ... As the mother of a baby who was hospitalized at 6 weeks because of a communicable illness, I wouldn't be traveling anywhere with even remotely questionable medical facilities with such a young baby. Pediatrics is a specialty, and babies that young are vulnerable. So if this is like an island wedding outside the US, I'd be super wary. \n\nIf you do book, I would make sure you buy cancel for any reason trip insurance with very very good medical coverage. We bought it for our baby moon because I was 6 months pregnant and MIL had recently gotten a dicey diagnosis. It was expensive and only reimbursed like 80% if we canceled, but it was better than losing the whole amount, and it covered like every possible medical contingency (because it was a sailing trip, so anything medical would've required helicopter transport). Speak to a travel agent, for stuff like this they are worth their weight in gold. \n\nAnd remember, your due date is a best guess.

My husband and I had to miss his younger sister's wedding in his home country just this summer because our baby was only a few weeks old. We considered having him go alone, but when the time came he just didn't have the energy or will to leave us. Not going to lie, it was really really hard for him to miss it and to know his whole family was there and he wasn't, but we skyped in via his mom's phone and said hi to everyone, they \"met\" the baby and we were able to congratulate the bride and groom in real time. Not ideal, but still special and kind of fun/funny. The bottom line is that our immediate family's needs were more important than the event.   \n\nAs for your situation, everyone has touched on the medical and logistical aspects already: neither you or the baby might be physically ready for the stress and other knotty aspects of flying.\n\nBut there is also your mental and emotional readiness to consider. The first few weeks with your first new baby are a mental and emotional whirlwind. **Your experience may be totally different**, but speaking for myself, not only was I physically exhausted, but I had no mental energy for anything else except coming to grips with my new life, and my emotions were in upheaval. Completely aside from the hassle of travel with a tiny baby, the idea of squeezing into presentable (breastfeeding-friendly, if that's your own plan) party clothes, putting on make-up, doing my hair and making small talk with loads of people (even loving family) would have been the very last thing on earth I would have been able or willing to do.  I did have visitors over occasionally, and I could get cleaned up and be social, but after just an hour or two the baby and I were toast, visiting hours were over and we could gently shoo people away and rest as much as we needed. As the sister of the bride, at a destination wedding, you won't have that kind of easy exit strategy to fall back on. Plus you'll be in a foreign country attending possibly multiple events where you'll be pressed to be supportive and bubbly and chatty, when all you really want *and need* is be comfortably at home with your baby. Just something else to consider...\n\nYou mentioned in other comments that your sister is being sort of uncommunicative with you and you feel hurt by it. I think it's time for you guys to have a heart to heart about the reality of the situation, and the possibility that you'll miss her wedding. It's going to be a difficult conversation, but it needs to be had. And perhaps you guys can come up with some alternative solutions; spending lots of extra time together before the big day, a skype-in to the wedding, a family party when she comes back...\n\nAlong other lines, you should also start tuning out other family members' expectations about what you can or should do, even well-meaning ones. **You** won't even know what you'll be up for or capable of until the time comes, and everyone responds differently to childbirth and the newborn phase, so you definitely shouldn't let anyone else tell you what you should or shouldn't be ready for at that time. This is a time to start looking inward, being selfish, and listening to your gut. \n\nGood luck to you!", "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "created_utc": 1516826202, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dt6n1cl", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7snnl1", "parent_id": "t3_7snnl1", "permalink": "/r/Mommit/comments/7snnl1/flying_with_a_newborn/dt6n1cl/", "retrieved_on": 1516826203, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"approved_at_utc": null, "author": "bananasmcgee", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "banned_at_utc": null, "body": "OP, other people have made some great points, I just want to summarize:  \n* It is highly likely you will not give birth on time. Take it from me who had to be induced and was two weeks overdue.  \n* Even if your baby is born on time, I can't see any possible way you will be able to secure a passport for your baby in time to fly. It took a couple of weeks for me just to get my baby's birth certificate and I was right on top of it. It will take additional time to secure the passport after you get the birth certificate.  \n* You could end up with a C-section. If you have a C-section, there's no way you will be able to travel in two weeks.  \n* Even if you have a perfect birth, no complications, and physically feel okay, traveling internationally two weeks post partum will knock you on your back.  \n* If you are planning on breastfeeding, I do not recommend flying for a minimum of a month. For the first 2-3 weeks of my son's life, the only way I could figure out how to nurse was laying on my side. That meant every 1.5-2.5 hours I had to go into our bedroom and nurse him on our bed. Plus babies nurse for 30-60 minutes for each feeding for the first 1-2 months.  \n* Germs. Enough said.  \n  \nIf this were not an international trip and you were driving 8 hours to the wedding, I would say it might be doable. Miserable, but doable. Since it's an international flight, I just don't see how you can make it happen.  \n  \nI also don't think leaving the baby is an option, even if you're formula feeding. The baby needs to be fed every 2-3 hours around the clock. Your partner will need your help so they're not dangerously sleep deprived. And if you're breastfeeding, forget it. There's no possible way you will be able pump enough milk in two weeks when you're barely establishing supply to feed a baby for multiple days while you're gone.  \n  \nI know you really want to go, but I'm going to be blunt.  Logistically, the only remotely possible way for this to happen would be for your baby to be born three weeks early and completely healthy. That's the only way I can see you getting a passport on time.

Maybe they gave them way more pain pills back in the day so you couldn\u2019t feel anything? I mean you are bleeding for about 6 weeks, boobs leaking, sleeping one hour at a time, belly all weird and wobbly, bits are achy and bruised at best, lacerated and stitched up (over half of first time moms tear - it sounds worse than it is, but stitches do take a few weeks to heal), or a c-section which can be even worse because of how much muscle they cut through, it\u2019s hard to stand up for more than 5-10 min at first without feeling like your insides are going to come out. Babies and wonderful and I love baby cuddles - but it\u2019s kind of awesome that they don\u2019t wake up much the first two weeks because it gives your body some time to recover before baby gets more demanding. \n\nIt\u2019s generally a time that you want some family around to help take care of you so that you can take care of baby. \n\nI mean - can you travel? Sure - in the sense you can do anything. But its going to be way less pleasant compared to normal travel unpleasantness.  If you\u2019re planning on breastfeeding, travel is particularly unpleasant - especially when you and baby are still trying to figure it out together and learning. \n\nAsk your OB for percentages at your hospital for c sections and tears.  The hospital will generally have all the stats about risks at that particular facility that they disclose in the consent paperwork that you sign before giving birth. (some places in the south have like 50-60% c section rates.)
