She nurses for naps(sometimes to sleep,sometimes just drowsy) but it is separated from bedtime by about half hour or so. We do dinner, nurse, bath, story, song, sleep.

I try to let her settle herself if she wakes up and sometimes she does and sometimes she doesn't -i usually go in if it takes longer than 20 to 30 mins in the middle of the night, depending on whether she is disturbing my son, how long it has been since her last wake up and how close to getting up time it is but she is more consistent with not settling than she is with actually settling in the night time. \n\nI feel like I'm doing it right but it's just not working.

If so, you might have luck with reducing the night time wake ups by night-weaning her. If there's nothing to wake up for, she may very well just stop waking up. \n\nThere are a ton of ways to go about night weaning her, but one way you can do it is to drop one feed at a time. If she wakes up at approx 1a, 3a, and 5a, for example, start with the 1a feed. When you drop that feed it means she can't eat until 3a. It sucks because at first she may never really settle until that 3a feed, but after a few days she should stop waking up for that feed, or she will be easier to settle if she does (because she won't be looking for food). Once she's consistently good about sleeping until 3a, you can drop that feed too. Then for the 5a feed (or whatever time that last wake up/feed is) you can decide if you also want to drop that, or if you're OK with that one. \n\nOn the other hand you can also go \"cold-turkey.\" This is my preferred route, but I know it's hard on some babies/parents to do it this way. In my opinion it usually works the fastest and results in the least amount of total crying. I would plan to combine this with CIO (the check-in/interval kind, not the extinction kind). One thing that a lot of parents notice is that once they start this method, even if they plan to do it over time and drop feeds slowly, they don't even have to because once they learn to get through dropping the first feed, they don't even wake up for the others.
