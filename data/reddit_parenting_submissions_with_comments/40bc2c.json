I THINK this is what has caused him to start thinking about his mortality, death, etc.\n\nWhen we married he was mid 30s and we had agreed on 2-3 kids and waiting 2 years to start having kids. It was closer to 3 years, we now have a 10 month old. We had said we would try for baby #2 right after a year.\n\nI noticed he has been in a mood lately, and yesterday I agreed that if he told me, I would just listen and not respond (that was his request knowing I wouldn't like to hear what he had to say). So he told me he doesn't want another child because he doesn't want to be an old dad, because he doesn't want to be in poor health when the kid is in their 30s, because he would never meet his grandkids- just like his dad never met our son. I listened and asked if we could have a discussion on this next year. Because I'm also not ready for baby #2 right now - I've gotta lose the baby weight or I'll have an at-risk pregnancy. Plus, I had promised just to listen and not discuss. \n\nBut you guys- I'm heartbroken. We had even agreed that if baby #2 was a boy we would try a 3rd time for a girl. Now, the thought of having an only child makes me so sad! I realize we are blessed to even have this little guy, so please don't think I'm ungrateful. It is just such a change in what I had always envisioned as my family. \n\nAny thoughts/comments/suggestions?

Be willing to hear him out as well.  The long version is below.\n\n&gt;this post is so close to the anniversary of your father's passing.\n\nI think that\u2019s why I decided to answer.  It hit close to home and is still fresh in some ways for me.\n\n&gt;What were things that would upset me?\n\nThe times when she would point out cute babies or baby clothes at the store, though I knew she wasn't doing it to hurt me.  I was angry over my dad's passing and, unfortunately, she would get the brunt of it by way of my refusal to talk.  I wasn't **adamant** about never having a child again, but I wasn't thrilled with talking about it either.  I did tell her I was not ready to talk about it.  If she started hinting at the topic later on, I typically would just change the subject when it came up, to which she would drop it for a while (usually a month or so).\n\n&gt;What made me marvel at the goodness of my wife?  What moved me?\n\nThe fact that she never gave up on me.  She reminded me she was there whenever I was ready to talk.  She\u2019s Italian, so patience and calm demeanors are not her strong suit.  She\u2019s used to facing problems head on and calling people on their shit.  She knew, however, I was already depressed because I hated my job where I\u2019d worked for 5 years before my dad died.  Rather than face my grief, I threw myself into work and emotionally suppressed everything for a year.  I wouldn't talk to anyone if it had to do with my emotional well-being.  I shut my wife out and I barely played with our daughter except out of obligation.  She has the patience of a saint because anyone else would have left me and would have been right to do so.  \n\nAs time went by, the pressure from my job increased and so my depression became worse.  It got to the point I was working 60-75 hours a week, so I barely saw my family.  She still never gave up.  She still made sure we were taken care of and reminded me that she was still there whenever I was ready to talk.  13 months after my dad died (February 2015), I lost my job.  It was the best thing that ever happened to both of us.  The free time forced me to grieve the loss I ignored for so long, it forced me to realize how much I neglected my family, and it forced me to finally realize my wife has been trying to help all along.", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1452552447, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "cyuld5s", "link_id": "t3_40bc2c", "parent_id": "t1_cyu8ky3", "retrieved_on": 1454428639, "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"author": "gazork_chumble_spuzz", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "You can do it.   :)    There are a ton of awesome fitness subreddits, too, if you need advice or encouragement and support.", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1452565680, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "cyutnz5", "link_id": "t3_40bc2c", "parent_id": "t1_cyu6rjg", "retrieved_on": 1454432631, "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"author": "Creepella_the_third", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "Ugh...now my husband is saying \"This is the last one\" anytime the baby does something he doesnt like.
