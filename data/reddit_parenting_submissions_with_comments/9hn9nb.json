The first three months was the worst of it.  She was so very needy, yet so incredibly boring.  Going back to work made things a little easier on me, and my daughter started to get less demanding with time.  Things gradually got better, and I really started to feel like I could take big pieces of my life back around the one year mark.  But, for a long time, whenever anyone asked if I was having a second, I'd say \"not until I forget how hard the first was.\"\n\nA little after my first hit 2 years old, I was still dreading going through the baby phase again.  But, I decided to go ahead and have a second anyway.  I didn't really want to have a baby and a toddler, but I did want to have two kids who could play together, and I wanted to have two adult children to share the burden of putting up with me in my old age.\n\nMy oldest is 3, and I've had my youngest for 6 months now.  The first couple months of having my second were rough, but maybe not quite so bad as I imagined.  There were plenty of times where I had to deal with a hungry or overtired baby when I really wanted to just be playing with dolls or ponies with my oldest.  There are still times when I just want to sleep and I can't get them to both sleep at the same time.  But, I think my second is less demanding than my first was, and we're making things work.\n\nI love seeing my kids interact.  My oldest can make her little sister laugh like no one else.  Sometimes just seeing my oldest walk in circles around the house can set the baby off in fits of laughter.\n\nI know there'll be plenty of bickering in the future.  I've already heard, \"She's touching me!\" to which I've responded, \"She's a baby.  You can move away to where she can't reach you.\"  But, I still think I'm glad I went for two.\n\nAll that said, I think I could have been pretty happy with just one as well, and I can totally understand making that choice.", "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "created_utc": 1537551702, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e6e39nf", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_9hn9nb", "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_9hn9nb", "permalink": "/r/Mommit/comments/9hn9nb/3_months_in_and_barely_surviving_one_and_done/e6e39nf/", "retrieved_on": 1537551703, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"approved_at_utc": null, "author": "strictlytacos", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_bgzl0", "banned_at_utc": null, "body": "My son just turned 7 months.

Unlike most women, I don't think they're cute or endearing, I didn't like my bump and I never took photos.  Just a weird quirk of mine I guess.\n\nSecond, the first 16 months were incredibly difficult.  Our daughter was colicky, had acid reflux, and gastrointestinal issues that were only finally resolved around that 16 month mark.  Also, I think I had undiagnosed PPD.  I am terrified of going through that again.\n\nWith that, since about 18 months, I would say our daughter has gotten really fun.  She has such a personality and is so adorable.  I'm still scared to be pregnant again and make it through another first year, but I've finally seen the light at the end of the tunnel and I know that whatever hardship it brings, having a second would be worth it in the long term.
