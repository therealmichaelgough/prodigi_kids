Do any of you have problematic grandmas and what have you done?\n\nMy DD is only 3 months old, but I fear that my mother can become an issue in the future. She talks alot about having her come over for visits alone when DD is older, and it's not like I wish to rob my daughter of her grandparents.\n\nProblem is, my mother is not a very considerate person. She isn't abusive, but she doesn't seem to mind saying things to people that are downright hurtful. Growing up I got told that I wasn't as intelligent as my sister and she would make remarks at my weight unprovoked (mind you, not in a helpful way, but rather \"you can't wear a shirt like that when you have such chubby arms\" if I wore a sleeveless shirt). She has also made some very rude comments about my DH when he wasn't present, and if you point out that something is rude of her to say, she will just brush it off saying that it is meant to be helpful and never apologizes. \n\nI fear that she may talk in the same way to my DD   when she grows up if DD somehow doesn't adhere to her \"standards\". If I'm there I can tell my mother off, but is there a way to catch it if my mother will be like that when I'm not around? As in, how do I know if my mother says things to DD she shouldn't be saying?

I know this may be hard for you but if you do start making those comments in front of her, I will explain to DD that grandma isn't using kind words about others and we're going leave until you can use kind words. This isn't about punishing you, it's about teaching her what is or isn't appropriate according to DH and I.\"\n\nIf she freaks out, leave and tell her to call you when she is willing to continue the conversation calmly and like adults.

We won't go with anti-vaxx, so they invite us when they don't invite that family, and lead the conversation casually to let us know that they won't be there. The sister has backed way way way off.
