Dryer is convenient, but not required! \n\nWe use some pocket diapers, but our favorite is prefolds and snappies with real nappies covers. The pocket diapers need to be stripped though, as the ones I have seem to have a build up from her diaper rash cream. \n\nI used disposable diapers with my first child, so I have a pretty good perspective of both. Disposable diapers have a funky smell to them. I also can't believe how freaking expensive they are! Seriously. \n\nFor the price of a Costco box of diapers you can get a set of six covers and a dozen prefolds. It's about enough to get you through a day if you wash daily. Two sets of that will allow you to wash every other day, or have one set for wear and one in the wash (this is the best option I've found). \n\nThe prefolds we have have lasted from 3 months through now, and my 11 month old is wearing 2T! We've just had to buy bigger covers as she outgrew them, and for two sets it's, again, roughly the same as a Costco box of diapers. \n\nThey are bulkier than disposable diapers, so a bigger diaper bag is a good idea, you need some bags for dirty diapers, and then you're set!
