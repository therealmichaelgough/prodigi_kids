His name had been chosen, his brothers were excited for his arrival, and his father and I beamed with pride in route to the hospital. As most inductions go, it was a long day, we waited and waited until it was finally time to meet our boy. At 3:40 pm, he was here, I laughed and cried and couldn\u2019t believe I had once again brought a beautiful life into this world. \n     The normal things happened, tests were ran, he passed them all, and we were sent home after 24 hours. As we got home we learned quickly that life with three boys was crazy, hectic, and that we felt more love than we had ever felt before. Our puzzle of a family was complete with it\u2019s final piece finally making its way into our home. Everything was wonderful, tiring, and exciting. \n    He functioned normally for the first three days. He ate, pooped, peed, slept, repeat. It became monotonous, but I loved every moment of time I had with my darling new boy. After day 7, I became concerned as he was no longer stooling, every doctor told me this could be normal in a breastfed baby, I listened. It wasn\u2019t until a visit with my lactation consultant, who looked him over and said she could hear great bowel sounds and didn\u2019t see an immediate issue, told me about her time as a nicu nurse and told me that if he started throwing up feces... we had an issue. But she wholeheartedly didn\u2019t believe it would happen, as she had seen it once in her 20+ years. \n    At 11 days old, he threw up bright green. Then he kept throwing up and he refused to feed. I immediately contacted his pediatrician and told them our issues. They worked us into their schedule immediately. After arriving, he seemed to get worse, the throwing up increased and it became the brightest shade of green I have ever seen. I was terrified. \n     His pediatrician seemed concerned but not enough to instill unnecessary fear until she knew for sure what our next steps would be. She took us to an X-ray and told me she was going to call the surgery team at our local children\u2019s hospital to see if they had suggestions. Before our X-ray was done, she was in the radiology area, telling me we needed to sit and have a talk. (Not necessarily what you want to hear about your eleven day old.)\n    She explained to me that the surgery team thought our son may have a bowel obstruction and that we needed to drive to our local hospital for an IV and an NG tube followed by a transfer to the children\u2019s hospital. I instantly filled with heat. I couldn\u2019t even cry. I whisked him away with out a word, but as soon as the air from outside hit my face, tears came. What does this all mean? Is he going to be okay? What\u2019s wrong with my baby?\n     After a long drive that seemed to take forever, we made it to the children\u2019s hospital after our short trip to our local. They immediately started looking for a place to put an IV as his tiny veins were shriveled up and he was extremely dehydrated. They took us for barium enemas, xrays, did blood labs, and finally admitted us to the NICU. He finally got his IV in the nicu. His enema showed radiologists that he had \u201cmega colon\u201d which is the main sign of a disease called Hirschsprung\u2019s. The radiologist said it out loud and I never realized that it would change my life forever. \n     The next day, he had a bedside rectal biopsy, then a perc line placed, and finally after many attempts at irrigating our dear boy and it failing... his biopsy reports came back. He was two weeks old when he was diagnosed with Hirschsprung\u2019s disease. Hirschsprung\u2019s is defined by missing ganglion cells in the colon and small intestine that make it impossible for stool to come out. He was scheduled to surgery to place an ostomy the very next day. \n     His surgery started at 1:30 pm, he was in for 5.5 hours before the surgeon came to give us his report. Our sons entire colon was useless. He was then considered total colonic Hirschsprung\u2019s. Hirschsprungs itself is 1 in 5000 babies born, typically males, and is considered a genetic disease. Having total colonic Hirschsprung\u2019s made him even more of a rarity. \n     He handled surgery well, we had a total of 14 days staying at the children\u2019s hospital before we went home. After returning home, things were amazing for about 3.5 weeks, until they weren\u2019t. Our boy had an obstruction due to too much scar tissue in his small intestine from the last surgery. So now the ileostomy I had just gotten used to being on the right side of his belly, was now rerouted to his left. \n    My life has become a constant blur of hospital stays, ostomy care, and learning the ins and outs of caring for a medically needy child. I love this boy more than words can say, he is so very special to me and while he will have an ileostomy likely for the rest of his life and we still haven\u2019t gotten him to a perfect and comfortable place... I\u2019m working my hardest to find answers for him. \n\n\nTL:DR-Our son was born with a genetic intestinal disease called Hirschsprung\u2019s and had his colon removed at two weeks old, had an ileostomy placed and ended up having another surgery to reroute his ileostomy 3.5 weeks later. We still don\u2019t have all the answers but hope to soon.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3", "subreddit_subscribers": 75775, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Becoming the mother to a disabled child.

That being said, I don't see him because of any intellectual issues, I just make sure he has the accommodations he needs to function in school and I get him caught up if he falls behind due to Dr. appts and/or being sick (he's out longer than some kids).  He has his special toileting routines that he goes to the nurse for. He has a fitbit type watch that vibrates during the day for feedings and the toilet stuff. \n\nAll this being said, the props go to his parents. They make sure that he has the most normal childhood possible. That tube feeding? Has to happen before lunch so that he can do lunch with his friends. His toileting doesn't get in the way of recess or other things. His parents make sure that he goes to all the birthday parties he's invited to and they make sure he plays the sports he wants to. Sometimes with accommodations, but they are tireless in having him be as normal as possible. Because of that, he doesn't think he has limits. He just does stuff his way and it's fantastic to watch. \n\nI know these times are stressful because he's so small, but he has a bright future and if you continue to advocate for him in school and beyond like you are now, there won't be anything he can't do!", "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "created_utc": 1562555313, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "gildings": {}, "id": "et8fuo2", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_cack2h", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_cack2h", "permalink": "/r/Mommit/comments/cack2h/becoming_the_mother_to_a_disabled_child_our_story/et8fuo2/", "retrieved_on": 1562555314, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3", "total_awards_received": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "approved_at_utc": null, "author": "mrslittenxo", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_43eiz9qg", "author_patreon_flair": false, "banned_at_utc": null, "body": "Thank you so much for this \u2665\ufe0f it is so hard to know what the future might look like but it\u2019s amazing knowing that there are kids like my son out there and they are thriving because their parents will not rest unless they are! \n\nThis just made me feel so happy, an odd feeling, but so relieved!", "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "created_utc": 1562555463, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "gildings": {}, "id": "et8g1xm", "is_submitter": true, "link_id": "t3_cack2h", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t1_et8fuo2", "permalink": "/r/Mommit/comments/cack2h/becoming_the_mother_to_a_disabled_child_our_story/et8g1xm/", "retrieved_on": 1562555464, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3", "total_awards_received": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "approved_at_utc": null, "author": "Panpaan", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_xpi9th2", "author_patreon_flair": false, "banned_at_utc": null, "body": "Thank you for sharing your story.

Then I quietly go through the process of thickening her milk, and putting it into the special pouch she can drink from with help. \n\nOr, I\u2019m too worn out from therapy visits and doctors visits to take her to story time or play-dates. \n\nThe stay at home moms I know struggle to relate to my mess of a self and tangle of busy schedules filled with appointments. The working moms I know think I\u2019m just another SAH mom. \n\nAnd I\u2019m just tired. \n\nRecently I had two emergency surgeries and my husband and mom took over my job. Even then my daughter\u2019s had to miss a lot of her normal appointments.
