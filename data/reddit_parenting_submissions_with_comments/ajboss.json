Gives me time to hang out with my son while dinner is cooking and I get a hot meal on the table. I also really love my instant pot for making one pot meals on the same premise- a little bit of prep time then set it and walk away while dinner cooks in a short amount of time.  You can also look into crock meals so that you have some go-to big batch items like Chili or stew that feeds everyone for a few meals and that saves on your time as well. I try to make a big batch of soup/stew/chilli on the weekend so we have lunches throughout the week and then freeze half of it for later or emergency dinners.\n\nMeal planning can also be key. Take time Atbthe start of your week to set a basic outline of food/meals for the week, it also helps with your grocery list and staying on a budget. Just remember to be flexible, sometimes you don\u2019t feel like the thing you planned to make on a certain night of the week and add in a take-out night every so often.

Read the whole recipe before you start anything.\n\n2. Prepare your vegetables and meat before you start cooking. (I used to try to chop vegetables while cooking other things. It always ends badly)\n\n3. Find a friend or family member who makes something you enjoy. Ask to cook it with them and try to learn from them.\n\n4. Keep trying new recipes. After a while you start to get instincts for how things should look and taste.\n\n5. Watch YouTube videos to see how to chop different vegetables.\n\n7. Taste as you go and make sure to salt while you're cooking. Throwing all of the salt on at the end makes it taste bad.\n\n8. Buy the proper tools. I would try to whisk with a fork and cook in the wrong kind of pans and it would mess up the consistency of things or change the cook times.\n\n9. Start with online recipes. A lot of them have step by step instructions with pictures.\n\n10. Don't stress. Some days I spend hours making the most delicious, healthy meals and my kids ask for hot dogs and my husband has been snacking the whole time so I'm the only one who eats it. It doesn't make you a bad mom or wife that you aren't perfect in this one way. It just takes a lot of focused effort and time. I wasn't confident with my cooking for 5 years after I got married. Now I enjoy it and I feel like I'm pretty good at it.\n\nIf you have some specific areas that you struggle with I would love to give you more tips. I cannot stress enough how bad I was at cooking when I was younger. If you're struggling with something I probably struggled with it too. ( I didn't know what garlic was when I got married.

Season everything to your taste, you can get a bunch of different varieties of Mrs. Dash seasonings that make the same base ingredients taste very different every day, and build from there. There's a lot of variety you can come up with from just the simple ingredients.\n\nPlus, it can be pretty cheap to do it that way. You can get frozen veggies and rice for super cheap.

Now I'm pretty good, learning more every day. \n\nFirst: don't trust the internet recipes. I fell into the trap of beautiful Pinterest meals and \"super easy!\" recipes from small blogs. A majority of them just are not good. Especially if you aren't familiar with cooking techniques, a lot of \"easy\" recipes oversimplify steps or omit the complicated ones entirely. \nLook at Allrecipes.com and stick to things with very high ratings with a lot of reviews. Or pick up a cookbook or two from the library. \n\nSecond: do some research. I would suggest any cookbook from America's Test kitchen. Very easy to understand and explains how to do stuff and WHY you're doing it that way. I got \"The Science of Good Cooking\" for Christmas and it's a game changer. The more you know about why you're doing stuff or adding ingredients in that order the better you'll be. I went to the local library, checked out a dozen books that sounded interesting and then bought the ones that really helped me. \n\nThird: Seasoning. Spices and seasoning is so important! Smell and taste everything as you go along. I found most recipes online suggest half the spice and double the sugar/butter that's actually needed. I was always afraid of salt, but it makes such a difference. Add a tiny bit at a time. \n\nForth: practice! When something doesn't come out right, Google it. Look it up in the cooking subreddits. Try to figure out what went wrong and try again. To save on waste, I usually make a half batch of anything I haven't made before. \n\n\nThe cooking subreddits are really good too, and Alton Brown has videos on YouTube to explain the how and why of cooking. His recipes are consistently awesome too.\n\n\nYou dont have to be Martha Stewart, but having one or two \"signature dishes\" is a total ego boost.

Cooking skills don't define how good of a mother or a wife a woman is. Also, cooking is something that needs to be learned. Even the best cooks had to learn and experiment at least one time in their lives.\n\nI was born in a family of cooks, so the pressure was really baddd. Like I thought I was never gonna be a good cook because of how high the standards should be. Anywho, eventually I learned. Maybe I am not as good as how my elders are when it comes to cooking... but I did learn and somehow still learning. I currently am confident in my cooking. But I still admit that I am very far from \"best\". I still make unfixable mistakes... but I don't feel bad. It happens.\n\nOne advantage I have is that my husband was raised in a home of not-so-good cooks.. so there's that. Lol. So everything I cook is still tasty for him. Apparently, a reject cook from a family of good cooks is already a goddess for a man who practically never really tasted great home cooked meals.\n\nAnyhow, my cooking advice is to try to start small and master an easy dish. If you can master seasoning a simple dish, you will eventually have the \"pulse\" to season a bigger dish. Say, be an omelet master.. or a sunny side up master. You will then quickly improve and move on to a more complex dish!\n\nMy other advice in cooking is to not hurry. Follow your instincts when it comes to time and temperature. Recipes are great guides but it's still important to follow your guts.\n\nI 100% believe that you will be a good cook soon. There is absolutely no reason for it to be impossible.

Its awesome!) \n\nThe great thing about cooking is you can and will get better the more you do it. And you will figure out how you and your kids like things made. I almost always double or triple the amount of garlic that\u2019s called for. And I am not a big fan of black pepper so I often leave it out.

Not to make them soft / totally cooked just enough to season the veggies and get a little garlic on them in the drippings. Put the veggies under the roast in the crock pot to cook better. I like jasmine rice with everything and I make it in a cheap rice cooker because it\u2019s 10x better or I put my roast over egg noodles. \n\nBonus: crockpot liners work great.

Usually found by the lettuce and pre-pared veggies. This is prechopped veggies, everything you\u2019d need for the veggies in this recipe, just dump them in!)  \n1 tablespoon of dried parsley \n1 tablespoon of garlic powder\n3 teaspoons of  salt and pepper \n2 quarts of chicken stock (low sodium) \nPut it the crock pot for 8-6 hours on low. \n\nAdd pasta of your choice for the last hour of cooking and turn the crock pot to high. Or cook pasta separately and add 5 minutes before serving . \n\nMy family likes egg noodles with it. \n\nYou got this Mom.

Part of the reason I think might be because when I started learning to cook I was probably like 19 or so and was doing Weight Watchers. Most of the recipes didn\u2019t call for stuff like butter. When I got older I would cook and limit oils and butters and it just never compared to the homestyle cooking my husband grew up loving. Additionally, my family is Hispanic/Caribbean and my dad used to cook almost exclusively Latin American and Asian (for some reason) foods, so I would always have a taste for that. The recipes I would select were almost always ethnic in nature but I was trying to make these things with all that Weight Watchers training in mind, plus since I was now living in the Midwest and not in Houston or South Texas anymore, I was always missing important ingredients because there weren\u2019t any ethnic food stores around. Lastly, my husband and kid are Midwesterners, obviously, so I\u2019d get all excited about making some dish with rice or with trying to do something like enchiladas the \u201cright\u201d way and they just were meh about it or totally turned off. I would try to do something like casseroles (that\u2019s Midwestern, right? Haha) and my husband would be nice but also complain that it was just \u201cmash.\u201d\n\nTo this day, I still can\u2019t cook a meal that makes everyone happy which kind of bums me out because I really do love cooking as an expression of love...and SOMETIMES what I cook, they really like.\n\nWhat ended up working for us was a meal-delivery program (we went with Hello Fresh.) I looked at our grocery budget and realized it was more cost effective than I thought.\n\nFor one, before Hello Fresh, I would try to meal plan and end up wasting tons of food and money. The recipe would call for, say, a little bit of celery. But to get that, you have to go buy a whole stalk. So I spend money on the whole stalk, use a little bit, and then the rest of the celery rots because my kid hates it and my husband and I are too busy to figure out how to use the rest of this celery. \n\nI just couldn\u2019t figure out how to do meal planning where you make and freeze recipes without wasting tons of food and money.\n\nWe realized we were spending upwards of $500 a month on groceries trying to make everyone happy.\n\nWith the meal kit, we\u2019re spending like $240 a month on that, getting 3 SUPER yummy dinners a week out of it, and then we probably spend an additional $100-$150 on just like canned soups, frozen meals, drinks, veggies, fruits, all of which is mostly just what my daughter eats and simply breakfasts and whatever else.\n\nThe meal kit has also been helpful because I feel like we never waste food. We eat every bite and no food goes in the trash.\n\nBut it\u2019s also been super helpful in showing me what I\u2019ve been doing wrong this whole time as a cook! \n\nLastly, it\u2019s awesome because we\u2019re actually excited to make a meal and sit down and enjoy it together. Grocery shopping is so much less stressful too since we just buy the same stuff all the time.\n\nSo if it\u2019s in your budget, I honestly might just try that. Just pick one of them and go for it. :) I have referral codes if you wanna PM me for one. (I\u2019m not trying to get a deal here, I\u2019m not a blogger or something haha. Just offering an idea.)

At least 10-15 min\n* Don't overcook the pasta\n\nBasic tomato sauce recipe:\n\nFry a garlic clove in olive oil until golden brown. Add an [anchovy](https://imgur.com/qXr8rpK) and let it melt. Pour in the [passata](https://imgur.com/CJK6mXn). Fry at a low heat until it is mild and soft in flavour. You're not simply heating it, you're cooking it.\n\nVegetables:\n\nCauliflower, broccoli, carrots, potatoes are supreme when roasted in the oven. Clean them, chop them up bite size, spread them over oven paper in the oven tray, sprinkle olive oil on top. Salt it a bit, pepper it a bit. Sprinkle unpeeled garlic cloves around the tray.

If something looks like it's burning lower the heat and flip it. \n\nSeason your food before putting it in the oven or stove. My go to seasonings are salt, pepper, Adobe, sazion, garlic powder and onion powder. If you like spicy use red pepper.  Rub in seasonings into meat.  I also use sofrito when I'm making stir fry or cooking any veggies in a pan. I just use 2 tablespoons in the pan and mix it all up. \n\nIf you want to make yellow rice, buy white rice and put sazion in it while it's boiling and mix it. \n\nGet a meat thermometer.

And they also tell you the why behind it which is cool too. \n\n4) With the exception of ATK, I find the internet to be more reliable than cookbooks for recipes because of the reviews.

(hopefully your family likes spaghetti sauce!)  \nFirst though, I'll just add a few things that I learned since I got married and had kids:  \n\n\n\\-If you do what I do and look for recipes online, like on pinterest, look at the comments or ratings of that recipe first! I can't tell you how many times I made a recipe based on how amazing the picture looked only to have it turn out terribly! I learned to only use vetted recipes because there are \\*so\\* many out there. If you make on you like, keep it somehow. I like physical copies of my recipes so I print out the ones I have success with and put them in a binder.   \n\n\n\\-Make sure you follow recipes exactly and read all the instructions ahead! Two of my biggest mistakes that I still occasionally make are trying to alter a recipe on the fly and just reading the directions as I cook. You'll save yourself a world of trouble if you avoid these two things while building up your skills.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Chicken, rice, and veggies for the win! Practice baked chicken seasoned with just like salt, onion powder, and garlic powder (I like the instructions from LiveStrong but they're all pretty much the same if you google \"Plain Baked Chicken\"). Once you have it down, it's crazy easy to adapt. You bake it the same way but adapt the seasoning with anything like taco seasoning, pour BBQ sauce over the top, marinade in Italian dressing....so many possibilities! The secret I've learned for rice is to cook it in chicken broth, not water. It makes a \\*world\\* of difference! We have a rice cooker/steamer that I use all the time. My rice comes out perfect every time and so do steamed veggies. This combo is a very simple, generally cheap, and very adaptable way to feed your family.  \n\n\n\\-If you don't have one already, invest in a slow cooker. A bigger one since you have a family to feed. I am still learning out to use mine, but they are so very useful and can save you a lot of time.   \n\n\n\\-Don't give up! You can do this and with some practice and planning, it doesn't have to be stressful.  \n\n\nOkay, so here's my mom's spaghetti sauce recipe:  \n\n\n1 TBS onion powder\n\n1/2 c. pesto\n\n2 tsp beef buillon granules, or 1 T balsamic vinegar\n\n2 tsp oregano\n\n1 1/2 tsp basil\n\n1 tsp marjoram\n\n2 tsp salt\n\n2 tsp sugar\n\n2 (8 oz) cans tomato sauce\n\n1 (12oz) tomato paste\n\n2 (28 oz) crushed tomatoes (or 1 can crushed &amp; 1 can diced)\n\nI mix all ingredients in my slow cooker and set on low for 5-6 hours.

Don't focus on the recipe itself, but on techniques to help enhance your food. For example, I have a \"base\" I start with. I dice up 1-4 slices of raw bacon, 1 whole onion, about a tablespoon of butter, and about a tablespoon of minced onion. I'll toss it all together and saute them until the bacon is cooked and onions are translucent. \n\nFrom there, sometimes I add chicken stock and a bag of green beans and I have a side of green beans. Sometimes I don't add the bacon, but do add julienned bell peppers, once those are cooked I add sliced polish sausage, then serve it over angel hair pasta, and make sausage and peppers.\n\nFlavors from seasonings can change as they are cooked. Sometimes, adding it while cooking and then a little right before it's done is a good idea. When I make spaghetti sauce, I always add some of the garlic, onion, oregano, salt and pepper while I'm browning the beef.

Everything is prepared and put into the oven at once and at the same temp so you don\u2019t have to juggle a bunch of different things: \n\nIngredients: \n- one package boneless, skinless chicken thighs\n- 3 large sweet potatoes \n- 1.5lbs of Brussel sprouts (I love veggies)\n- salt\n- pepper \n- olive oil \n- garlic (depends on what you have, powdered works just fine, or the pre-minced jars like from Costco)\n\nDirections:\n- preheat oven to 390F \n- peel sweet potatoes, chop to about 1\u201d cubes, aiming for even sizes but it doesn\u2019t have to be perfect\n- clean Brussel sprouts, cut off the stem ends, and half them (if you want to, they\u2019ll cook fine whole too). \n- put Brussel sprouts and sweet potatoes into a large bowl, add about 5 tbsp of olive oil, 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp pepper, and garlic to taste (probably start with 1tsp if using powdered), then stir it all up to evenly coat (I put a plate on top and shake it because it\u2019s easy and I\u2019m lazy). \n- open chicken thighs and rinse with water then drain off as much water as you can. \n- place veggies and potatoes on outside edges of large cookie sheet. \n- place chicken in middle of cookie sheet. Sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper, flip and do the other side. \n- place in oven for 40 minutes then check. Chicken should be at 185F internally, Brussel sprouts should be somewhat tender, and potatoes you should be able to poke easily with a fork and have them slide off without hardly any effort at all. \n- If it\u2019s not quite there yet, cook an additional 7 minutes, check, and repeat until it\u2019s cooked to the right temp. \n\nTip: if you don\u2019t have a meat thermometer, get one. It literally took me from lame cook to passable when I moved in with my husband who had one. \n\nTL;DR: one pan chicken thigh, sweet potatoes and Brussel sprouts for dinner.

In fact I find it admirable that you are trying to be a better cook during this busy part of life. \n\nI would start by cooking simple things first. Properly cooking protein really doesn\u2019t need much. After you master cooking a protein, then you can add sauces or spices to elevate your meal.\n\nHere\u2019s how I cook a steak:\n-Bring a steak to room temperature. \n-Add salt &amp; pepper to both sides of the steak. \n-Heat up a cast iron pan with a little oil until it\u2019s really hot and just about to start smoking. \n-Place the steak into the pan and cook for ~3 mins on each side. \n-Use a thermometer to check the internal temp until it\u2019s at your desired temp (130-135F for medium rare).  It\u2019s so important to use a thermometer to get the right temperature; it\u2019s one of the best kitchen tools I purchased.\n-Let the steak rest. \n\nYou can serve this with roasted vegetables. I usually heat the oven to 400F. I toss asparagus with extra virgin olive oil, salt, and pepper. It only needs to cook for about 5 mins until it\u2019s bright green. I love to roast vegetables because I don\u2019t have to multitask; I can focus on the protein on the stove and let the oven cook the vegetable. \n\nAfter mastering how to cook proteins, then you can start to play with spices and sauces. If you make a steak, then you can make chimichurri sauce or a pan sauce to the dish. You could marinate proteins for another flavor profile. You can play with spices to find out what you prefer. \n\nThe beat way to become a better cook is to keep cooking and to learn from it. \n\nI trust America\u2019s Test Kitchen for delicious recipes that never disappoints. If you decide to follow their recipe, then I recommend that you read the entire recipe before you cook. I usually read the recipe the night before to make sure that I have all my ingredients (or a grocery list) and to have an idea of what to expect.

I didn't know the first thing about cooking when my husband and I started dating. I made him pork chops once and I thought broil meant to keep something warm and I put them in the oven to under broil to keep them warm until everything else was done and needless to say they came out more like potato chips than chops. I did a lot of the same things as mentioned above to learn how to cook.\n\n1. I watched some shorter cooking shows, 30 mins long, mostly Rachel Ray as I felt like she gave some great tips for working efficiently in the kitchen and just seeing how to she chopped and prepped was helpful. Now there's so much content on youtube that I bet you could search for a particular topic and learn a lot about it quickly. \n2. I talked with family members who were good cooks and learned from them. At family events, I actually asked them if I could hang out in the kitchen with them so I could watch/learn/help.\n3. I tried one new recipe each week.\n4. I took a cooking class through a local program that offered adult education classes for fun during the evenings. \n5. I tried to be easy on myself when things didn't turn out the way I expected (and still try to do that now). At the very least, I feel like my family knows I tried cooking a nice meal and when my kids sometimes comment on how they might not like something, I try to use it as a teaching moment and tell them I thought they might enjoy this and I tried to make a dinner they'd and sometimes things don't turn out the way you expect. That's part of cooking and life and then we just try to roll with it!\n6. Slow cooker and one pot meals are the best!! \n7. Now, I get my kids involved with picking out recipes and we pick together from things we think we'll both enjoy. I also have them involved in washing and my oldest with some chopping. That can be a bit harder when you're still learning to cook, but I find the kiddos eat the meal more readily when they've helped prepare it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;", "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "created_utc": 1548500163, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "ef080ak", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_ajboss", "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t1_eeuff1v", "permalink": "/r/Mommit/comments/ajboss/im_a_terrible_cook_and_it_makes_me_feel_like_a/ef080ak/", "retrieved_on": 1548500173, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"approved_at_utc": null, "author": "bickingbackbeinbool", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_9xusks0", "author_patreon_flair": false, "banned_at_utc": null, "body": "I\u2019m not a mom, I just like browsing different subs to get a feel for what other go through.
