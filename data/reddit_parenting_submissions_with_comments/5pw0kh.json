On top of that, various members of our family suffer from dust, pollen and dander allergies (plus we have a cat).  Lately our old Oreck vacuum has been performing below par, which is quite frustrating for my wife. She's expressed several times that she wants a better one. Her birthday is in two weeks and I would like to buy her a very high end vacuum. I found a [vacuum recommendation quiz](http://hazoog.com/quiz/best-vacuum-cleaner-amazon-vacuum-cleaners/), which suggested I buy the \"Dyson Cinetic Big Ball Animal Plus Allergy\".
