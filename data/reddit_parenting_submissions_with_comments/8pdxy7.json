I remember crying and hiding my face during birth scenes of movies. I have no idea where my fear came from, but any time the topic is brought up I get tense, and my heart starts pounding. \n\nSpecifically, I am absolutely terrified of anything being done to me against my will (fundal massages, episiotomies, etc.). I feel I\u2019d almost rather die than have a C-section and be awake during abdominal surgery. I\u2019m also petrified of a failing epidural. Please do not dismiss my fears as ridiculous. I know to many of you they are, but I cannot help my emotions in my own. \n\nYou mothers are absolute superheroes to me who have lived and overcome my worst nightmares. I hope to be as strong as all of you one day. \n\nI have considered adoption but would love to overcome my fears. So my question is, is anyone aware of counseling services for someone in my situation? Would it be appropriate to seek help before getting pregnant? \n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3", "subreddit_subscribers": 35918, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Counseling services prior to pregnancy?

She was an advocate for me in the hospital and voiced my concerns and wishes to the staff. Of course the greatest help she offered was with pain management; she was very skilled at trying a new position or massaging me or getting my husband to massage me or talk to me in a way that was soothing and comforting. I can't say enough how wonderful she was. I highly recommend having a doula in the room when you give birth. Two books I read and found helpful are Misconceptions by Naomi Wolf and Ina May's Guide to Childbirth. Idk how much use they would be to you but both helped me immensely.

All these women survived. Most of them did it without medicine, some in their own homes. I would force myself to watch them but soon I was saving them and watching them on a loop. It was kind of like desensitizing myself to it. I followed hundreds of women who were at the same stage of pregnancy as me and watched as we all got bigger, nested, worried, then started having babies. Half my friends list has a kid within a month of my due date. I watched them go through it right there with me.\n\nBy the time I got induced, I was terrified again. Suddenly I couldn't remember those women and all the fears of an emergency c-section or my body being destroyed crept back in. And then, somehow, 22 hours later I was holding my son. I didn't even tear. I thought I couldn't get through it and I did, I gave birth to my perfect little baby.  I imagine a lot of us, even the most confident, start to panic once it's go time.\n\nIt's normal to have fears, even if yours (and mine) are more anxiety than fear. It's normal to be scared and it's normal to worry it won't go the way you want... but you know what? You get through it. Even if there's a speed bump or two along the way, we get through it.

Why be in pain when you dont have to be? Contractions were intense and uncomfortable but not painful if that makes sense. The epidural took the edge off for sure. Once it came to the pushing part my body just took over. A couple times the nurses told me to stop pushing because the doctor wasn't in the room yet but I couldn't stop. My body kept pushing! I tore pretty badly but didn't feel it at all. The epidural kept me from feeling the stitches going in too. Post child birth I was given Norco for the pain which did the trick.

It was horrific. I have flashbacks to this day. Many women do. I get absolutely furious at all the women who think that because they were fine, birth is fine for everyone. It isn't. \n\nAnd there isn't any way around it. The hospital system will do things to you that you won't even know to refuse until it is too late. Midwives too are no guarantee; I've heard stories that would make your blood curdle, and that's just from the births that went well! \n\nBut like many dangerous and painful ordeals, there are things you can do. Get therapy to give you coping skills. Be in your best physical health to lessen the chance of complications, and an age where you have the best chance of a good outcome. The older you get the harder it is. Look up your hospital- not just your OB. And have someone there who will advocate for you in the moment. Not your baby daddy. No matter how great they are say to day, they'll be under too much to be able to be there for you too. A trusted friend or a doula, someone who is there solely to advocate for you. \n\nAnd most of all do not dismiss your own fears. It's not just a moment that fades. It's a turning point that makes your life forever different. We pretend things are fine because society sells this narrative that birth is a few moments of pain. The truth is that recovery from the psychological torment takes a long time, and has to be done while you are weak as a kitten, bleeding more than you've ever bled in your life, and expected to do the majority of care for a tiny creature without more than minutes of rest at a time. Prepare in every way you can, OP. It can be wonderful. But it can also be miserable. \n\nGood luck!", "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "created_utc": 1528422753, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e0axz8n", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_8pdxy7", "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_8pdxy7", "permalink": "/r/Mommit/comments/8pdxy7/counseling_services_prior_to_pregnancy_help_i_am/e0axz8n/", "retrieved_on": 1528422754, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"approved_at_utc": null, "author": "emmamiller22", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "banned_at_utc": null, "body": "I didn\u2019t know pregnant woman could take medication like that.

During my first pregnancy, I was so scared, especially towards the end. I remember frantically trying to figure out a way not to give birth but quickly reminding myself that there is no way out, baby will come eventually, and she will be so worth it. The first pregnancy they stopped all my anti anxiety meds (by second one there was research showing my anti anxiety medication, bupropion, was safe during pregnancy so I was allowed to stay on it which helped). First pregnancy, anything that could go wrong did go wrong: gestational diabetes, severe pre-eclampsia, urgent induction, epidural that took 2 anesthesiologists 2.5 hours and 8 tries to get in, 24 hours of labor where I failed to progress, lost my epidural with pitocin at max (ouch), baby was hooked behind my pelvis and face up, went to c-section, went under general anesthesia (since epidural had failed) had a reaction to the anesthesia, then had a hemorrhage and spent a day in ICU. \n\nThe reason I told you all of that knowing that that is what you are scared off is because I was terrified of all of those things happening too, during my childbirth prep class they are showing \u201cnormal healthy easy\u201d deliveries and I was chugging water the whole time to try and focus on not crying in front of all the other expecting couples, I wanted to vomit. The next day, I broke down and bawled to my coworkers because I was so scared. Then all of the fears I had about pain came true, but here is the thing, I made it through with the support of my husband, my mom and my OB; and even though my coworkers all thought I would never want another baby because all my fears came true, I had a second baby 2 years later and the second delivery was a dream - spinal anesthesia, I literally felt nothing during the second c-section, not even the \u201cpressure\u201d they told me they couldn\u2019t get rid of. It was so easy I literally thought \u201cman, I could do this again\u201d in the middle of the c-section. \n\nThe first birth was a rough 24 hours but almost 3 years later I have my absolutely amazing daughter to look at and I would do it all over in a heartbeat. All of my complications were just a culmination of bad luck, and unlikely to happen to you but it could, you know that, but it will be worth it. You could also be like my best first who had contractions for 4 hours, active later for 1 hour and pushed twice, easy as can be. \n\nMy advice is hope for the best, anything could happen; focus on your end goal (this might sound weird but I would carry a newborn pampers diaper with me because it smells like baby powder and taking a deep breath of it when I was feeling anxious gave me an overwhelming feeling of excitement to see my baby), make sure you talk to your OB, keep her in the loop on how you feel. My OB and all off the hospital staff was absolutely amazing the whole way through. I had PTSD with the second pregnancy and my OB did a great job working me through it, and the staff was so reassuring as I got ready for my scheduled c-section (even though I really wished for some Xanax) and the second one was such night and day different. \n\nYou can do this, I felt like I came out the other side a stronger person as well. You can do it and you won\u2019t regret a second of it once you are holding your little one.\n\nI hope this helped and didn\u2019t freak you out more, if you want to chat more I am happy to try my best to help.
