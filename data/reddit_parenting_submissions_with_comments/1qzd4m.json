I felt like this was wholly unacceptable.\n\nMy husband gets so out of sorts that he'll yell on the phone at me about the baby not shutting up, which of course hurts the baby's ears and makes him cry louder.

I imagine that the baby picks up on his stress and it affects him too. It sounds like your husband is having a really hard time coping with the new stress levels. Does he have a history with anxiety at all? It would be worth it to explore this with a doctor if you feel that this is beyond your average stress. If this isn't the case, I would explore some ways for him to cope with the stress BEFORE he gets to the point where he is yelling.\n\nI'm a SAHM, so I can kind of relate to your husband a bit. The newborn stage is pretty stressful IMO because you get so little feedback from your baby when he is happy. Once they start smiling and interacting with you guys, it will be SO much easier. \n\nAnyway, I'll just compile a small list of things that I personally would do on days where nothing soothes the baby. \n\n* First thing, try to solve the problem - Is baby fed, wet/soiled, comfortable, etc. I swear by the [5 S's](http://www.babycenter.com/0_harvey-karps-happiest-baby-method-for-baby-sleep-and-soothin_10373838.bc) \n* NAPS NAPS NAPS. seriously. That baby should only be awake for about an hour at a time before another nap. If the baby sleeps best in a swing (like mine) or a baby carrier, or the damn carseat after a short drive, then do it. An overtired baby is cry cry cry city! Overtired babies don't sleep because they are now too stressed out to sleep. Even now, a year and half later, I am STILL all about naps and keeping my baby from reaching critical overtired levels. \n* Once he's ascertained that the baby is fine (clean, fed, etc) and yet the baby is STILL crying, put the baby in a safe place and go outside for a few minutes to catch your breath. I can't even count the number of times I've done this. Probably the most effective thing really.\n* Try to be sympathetic when he calls. Sometimes during my fresh air breaks id call my husband almost crying and he'd just say \"I know its hard and you are doing your best. Everything will be ok\" I didn't need advice from him, just comfort. Noise levels affect us all differently, and I suspect that the constant crying gets to him on a level that you can't relate to. \n* Naps. OMG naps. I just want to reiterate that if the baby's crying due to overtiredness, you're too late. Ideally you should try to get the baby to nap at the first sign of tiredness, like big yawns and eye rubs. \n\nHopefully you guys can work out some kind of stress relief system for him.

I'm not in a rush to put him down because quiet-time while he's being held is still quiet time. If he's happy, I'm happy.\n\nThe baby does smile and interact a bit. Not too much, but a bit. \n\nI find that while I have an easy time going through that mental checklist of what the baby could need (hungry? tired? dirty? hot? cold? nose clogged?) my husband has a more difficult time figuring out what the baby might need. Sometimes the baby fusses in the middle of the night and it's just because he needs a layer taken off, and then he passes out again just fine, whereas my husband would be stressed out, totally unsure of what's going on.\n\nWe also have a gas problem, even with the reduced-lactose formula... simethicone is helping but not all the time.

The best things I've found is to tell him exactly what to do.\n\nSo maybe make a list that have things for him to check. And then be sure to add that sometimes babies just cry.

Babydaddy seems to be a similar temperament to your husband (he's got a hell of temper) and he used to just text me all day, really similar stuff. It's gotten a whole lot easier and will continue to, for both of our families. Before I went back to work, I laid down some laws and his mom backed me up and he basically sticks to them. The rules are this: you hold the baby while you feed him (there's a great article on kellymom about why this is important that you may want to send your husband), you pick the baby up when he is upset NO MATTER WHAT (also good articles about this all over the internet), and if all else fails, go on a car ride (cus the baby will sleep in the car and then the father can decompress for a bit). \n\nPretty much until O was 6 months old, he and Babydaddy would go on car rides every day I was at work, sometimes multiple times a day. Then we had to upgrade our car seat and that didn't work as well but also O was easier for Babydaddy to take care of. Something shifted in O and he would go to sleep for his dad and they'd have nice days. Babydaddy still gets irritated and needs to be 'off the clock' as soon as I get home but he's getting a better handle on it. I understand - he doesn't have handy dandy boobs to calm the baby down with. \n\nI think you and your husband need to have a serious talk about how he treats your son. Figure out some coping strategies and open up the lines of communication. Make sure both of you are on the same parenting philosophy bandwagon - that's easy for us because Babydaddy defers to my wishes cus I'm Mom and I do all the research. Present him with what you'd like for him to do and see what he thinks. And maybe he should call his mom/sister/aunt/bff/neighbor/college friend/whatever next time the baby is freaking out and he needs to vent about it - it will only stress you out and erode your trust in him if he calls you about it all the time. Cus I think that's the key - you need to be able to trust him to take care of the kid while you're not there so that in the future he has the confidence in his parenting abilities to take care of the kid so you don't have to all the time. \n\nHope that helps. It gets better, I promise! Remember, this is just a stage and it'll pass.
