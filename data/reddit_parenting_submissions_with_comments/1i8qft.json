I start to mix a bottle for my son, and they immediately jump in and ask why I'm not breastfeeding and if I breastfed my 2 year old son. Here's the thing, after my oldest was born, I had severe PPD. I had the best of intentions to breastfeed. He was nearly 10 lbs when he was born, and wanted to be latched all the time. It didn't help that he had acid reflux, so he was really crabby all the time. Anyway, after a few days of attempting to breastfeed, I began to resent him every time he was hungry. I did not feel like I had bonded or connected with my baby at all. My husband suggested I try formula. With the first bottle, it was like a sigh of relief. A couple months later, I ended up getting on medication for a few months until my hormones leveled out. I never did breastfeed him more than those first couple days. When my second son was born, I will admit it, I didn't even try. I had prenatal depression which turned into full-blown PPD about 24 hours after the baby was born, and I immediately started medication. When I try to somewhat explain this to women who ask why I'm not breastfeeding, they seem to think that I'm just using this as an excuse. They tell me that there were medications I could have taken that would have been safe. They tell me that I was selfish (!!) for choosing my mental health over the long-term benefits for my sons' health. \n\nAnyway. I'm genuinely curious what the majority of women think about this. I don't know if I'm just running into bitchy ladies. On the other hand, maybe I truly should have tried harder to breastfeed both of them. I've experienced a lot of guilt over it. Thoughts? Opinions?\n\nEdit: I just want to say a sincere thank you for all the love, support, and advice I've received. I'm definitely going to do my best to just blow off the people who are bringing such negativity in my life.

It's draining, and can make mentally 'normal' folks crazy.  On top of PPD? I can't even imagine.  I can easily see that getting really, really bad really, really fast.

Babies need mothers who are engaged and feeling good, not mothers who are pulling their hair out and crying while breastfeeding and resenting the whole situation.

Like 'i didn't want my boobs to look bad' or 'i wanted to keep partying' (and now I've just pissed off someone who wanted their boobs to stay perky).\n\nAs a side note, I think when a lot if breastfeeders press or seem horrible, it's because they can't imagine anyone not wanting to do it.  So they'll often assume one of two things: either the woman doesn't know they could have kept going (that certain drugs are OK for bfing, or that they probably did not have supply problems, or that a Dr gave them bad advice) or that the woman just didn't want to put in the work.

Someone else somewhere is raising their eyebrows at my muffin top or me giving kiddo a cell phone in the checkout line or feeding him whole grapes because OMG choking!!!!!  I don't want people to think my judginess is the horrible kind - I can raise those eyebrows and still be friends with people, and keep my mouth closed even when I think they've done something horrible.  We all do it, it's just a matter of how we express it or if we allow it to turn us into rude assholes.  I don't do that, and my whole point in IDing myself as a breastfeeding freak was solely to let op know that even as someone who's super into it and falls into the judgement trap (as horrible as that is), I think she has a super valid, solid, serious reason for not doing it and she's doing great and doing the best thing for her family.

Generally, this leads mthers to feel a need to be dishonest, or hedge, because they don't want to have to defend themself. This mostly occurs online- in person, people tend to be more understanding.\n\nPPD is, of course, a \"valid\" reason to choose to not breastfeed. Choosing to not breastfeed can sometimes lead to a worsening of PPD, so that should be a personal consideration. I would love, love, love to see more community SUPPORT for breastfeeding, but with rare exception, after the decision to formula feed has been made, the longer it has gone, the harder it wuld be to switch to breastfeeding, so WHY do women insist upon revisiting the subject and interrogating moms? It is like telling someone that they gave their child a hideous name, or that their tattoo is stupid. It is a pretty permanent choice that has already been made- even if an outside opinion would matter, the time where it COULD matter is long past. The only thing that is to be had is making the person feel like shit.\n\nI had PPD and breastfed. I medicated for the PPD 2 out of 4 times, and still breastfed. Breastfeeding was important to me, and I do not feel formula is quite where it should be, so it would take A LOT for me to make that choice. However, my choices aren't for everyone, and you do what you have to do to get by.\n\nThe only thing I would say is, if you have a third, I would hope that you would consider breastfeeding as an option, and research medications that are safe for breastfeeding (most of them are), and grab the number of the local LLL or IBCLC to give yourself the best chance. However, if you choose to formula feed again... that is absolutely your choice, and it is not only a valid one, it remains the majority choice in the US after the first few weeks.\n\nAlso, please remember the loudest voices are not what everyone is thinking... they are just the ones with no filter.
