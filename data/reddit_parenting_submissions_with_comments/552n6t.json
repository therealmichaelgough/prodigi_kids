I don't have a wide circle of mom friends locally that I can ask this sort of question, I have only been a mom for two years, and my husband suggested I check out Reddit. \n\nHow often do you realistically want to get pictures of your kids? I see a lot of mini sessions springing up all year around: Valentine's Day, Easter, Mother's Day, First Day of School, Halloween, and Christmas. What is actually realistic? Are all these sessions that kind of \"Pinterest mom\" kinds of pressure?\n\nMy personal inclination is to say like maybe 2 per year, but I want to provide what people are interested in. My inclination toward maybe 2 per year makes me concerned about over-doing sessions if I plan for more. I don't want people to feel like I expect them to book sessions every two months all year round and that's how \"I\" would feel. \n\nI would rather people invest in the pictures they really want to have and for me personally, that has never been mini-sessions. \n\nIf you can't tell, I am a horrible sales person. I don't like to tell people they need to spend money on things that I don't truly believe they need to have. Quality pictures are always worth the investment, but I think it is worth investing in the things that are most important to you, and for me that is: birthdays, family time and traditions, big events, notsomuch the themed shoots.\n\nDiscuss, please. I am truly trying to understand how to better conduct business that meets client needs and expectations, not just mine. Your pictures are about you, not me. And if I want to call myself a professional I feel it is my responsibility to use my vision and skills to make my client's expectations come to reality. Not to tell people what they want, be happy with my work, and them not get what they want. \n\nI don't want to just do what everyone else is doing because it is what is the \"norm\" but I can't just only offer the things I like because my taste is my own.\n\nIf this post isn't allowed, apologies in advance.

However, my coworker friend that recommended the photographer that we used for my baby's 1st birthday photos offers the same kinds of stuff you're talking about - Christmas, Easter, fall &amp; Halloween, etc... My friend does some of those. I don't think she feels pressured because I don't think the photographer personally and directly offers these services to clients and then waits for a response - that would be super awkward. If you're on her mailing list you get a little e-mail about these events. I don't think my friend does all of them, but if one is being offered around the time of year that she wants photos anyway then she'll go for it.\n\n\n\nI think if you are going to be a professional photographer it's smart to offer these things because people like variety and like things to be special. So if someone is getting photos taken because of a special event (birthday, first communion, kid lost their first tooth, whatever) it would be nice to be able to get photos that also correspond with the season so that the photos they get over the years don't look like the same damn thing over and over, just that the kids are older.\n\n\nAlso, why would you just offer two? A Christian family might really be into Christmas and Easter photos while other families might be into 4th of July and \"fall\" photos. People want to be able to have a variety to choose from and quite frankly if I had two photographers of equal talent to choose from and one only offered 2 special session types per year and the other offered many different kinds, I'd probably go with the one that has more offerings, especially since those particular 2 might not interest me.\n\nAlso think about your own schedule. Let's say you become a popular photographer. You're doing 2 themed sessions per year. So the families you serve that want themed photos all have to pack into your schedule during those timeframes. You're going to be overloaded, you won't be able to fit everyone in, and because your workload is going to be nuts during those times you'll be late getting finished products into people's hands, etc...\n\nOffering them doesn't mean people will feel pressured to book, I mean it's not like as someone is leaving a session you need to shove a flier in their hands for the next one you're doing and ask if they want to book the next session before they leave. It's like when Carter's is having a sale. I get the flier in the mail and if I need something I'll stop in, but getting the flier doesn't make me feel weird.
