We have a 3 year old son and a 6 month old son.  In the past 6 months we have had 10 various DR's visits regarding our 6 month old's hearing loss issues and now moving forward into more visits with hearing aid fittings.   \nThat stress alone is hard, but she transferred to a new school at the end of her recent maternity leave for her teaching position and that has added a longer commute and all the stress of trying to learn a new school and meeting/exceeding administration and parent expectations for her position.  Her new position is more rewarding, but she pays for it in added stress and she doesn't have as much planning as she used to.  She can't pump as much as she did with our first son, and it really makes her feel like she is dropping the ball.  \nShe also has a second job that is normally rewarding that keeps her out 2 nights a week and can add several weekend requirements and a lot of extra work in December.  With all of her current stress she is thinking about quitting the second job, but she is worried that this feeling is only temporary and she would really regret it long term. \nWe also have added stress with her mother keeping the boys for a couple days a week.  It does help us financially and she is great with the boys, but we have to pat her ego and deal with her throwing major and unwarranted fits on a weekly basis. We have talked about moving them to full time day care, but it would only make the relationship worse with her and her mother and the kids would really take a hit.  \nAll of that being said, she is having a hard time balancing it all.  I am there to help with the kids and house stuff, but she finds that she is just failing at a lot of small tasks that she normally handles.  This time of year is extremely hard on her, and I am thinking that if we can get through the next couple of weeks, she will have some time off and her next semester will be easier and her stress and anxiety will diminish.  \nShe did have added anxiety and depression during her pregnancy, that she didn't have during her first pregnancy.  She took some safe antidepressants and it helped a bit with the anxiety, but it made her feel foggy and tired.  The added tired feeling wasn't that big of a deal because she was already tired from being pregnant.  Shortly after the baby was born her hormones started to adjust and she started feeling a lot better and stopped taking it.  She feels a little bit like she did during pregnancy, but it's not as debilitating.  She doesn't want to take the medication now because she feels like it would be counter productive because the added fatigue of the meds would just limit her even more.\nI wish we had enough money so only one of us had to work, but it's just not an option.  \nI love my wife and I do everything I can. I can feel all the stress as well and it hurts me knowing how defeated she feels. She asks that if you have any ideas for dealing with fatigue and stress, to please let us know.  Does it get easier?

Sometimes I look back and am amazed that we did it though. \n\nThe things that got us through was to really just drop a lot of our expectations of ourselves. Nobody has a clean house with little kids. Nobody has everything together with little kids. Nobody has perfect meals with little ones We expected so much more of ourselves than was necessary. When I talk to my kids now (they are between 18-25yrs) they remember really crazy stuff we did. They remember dancing with me in the kitchen. They remember the dumb books we read (Everybody Poops?! What was I thinking??) They remember breakfast for dinner and dragging a mattress into the living room for pizza a movie. To me, I did those things because I was too tired to actually cook or because they were under my feet when I actually made it into the kitchen. To them, they were great adventures. \n\nAs for fatigue, make sure she goes for a checkup with her doctor. Get her B12, her Vit. D, Iron and her thyroid levels checked. What I thought was fatigue and anxiety was actually thyroid disease and anemia. \n\nAs for the other stuff, caffeine helped me get through. Caffeine and napping with the kids. There is nothing wrong with napping from 5:00 to 5:30 then starting dinner at 6:00 if she needs to. If it takes a 5 dollar Starbucks on the way home from school, then go for it. I remember my husband taking the kids to the movie and he would promptly fall asleep in the middle of it. They all survived. \n\nAt this point with your children being so young, it's a matter of just hanging on for dear life. Just hanging in there with whatever means necessary and doing whatever you can do to squeeze a little bit of joy out and sleep in when you can. \n\nIf you have to sleep with the baby in the room, do it. Don't feel bad. If you have to nap in front of a Disney movie, do it. If you need another cup of coffee or tea or god forbid a diet coke at 4pm, do it. \n\nIt will get easier physically.

And work related stress - my husband and I talk about work to each other so we don't let it stress us out. We bounce ideas, good days, bad days, and worries off of each other. This helps tremendously! If he knows I have a big project coming up, he'll pick up a pizza on the way home or take the kids to the park. Most articles say leave work at work.

It is a white board with a calendar for two weeks out, a more detailed weekly calendar/schedule with appointments, times, meal plans, etc, and an even more detailed daily schedule for my daughter (food/sleep/play).

Could you make the divisions more explicit, so that (for instance) you handle all laundry, so that she never has to think about it? It sounds from your description like you do your share of the work, but she may still be keeping the work that you do in her own mental space. There's a huge level of freedom in letting go of that.

Is she up a lot at night to do feedings? Could you switch to co-sleeping, or do some formula feeding, or something so that she gets more sleep?\n\n(5) What happens with food? Meal planning, shopping, cooking, clean up. Is there a way to make this simpler? Is she eating nutritious, tasty meals? Sometimes it helps to divide this up by weeks, so one person is in charge of meal planning for one week, and another person the next. Or, maybe you could do some bulk meal prep on the weekend together? Or, I've heard good things about the InstaPot (combination slow cooker/pressure cooker) - would it be worth investing in something like that?

Could you or your MIL take the kids out for an afternoon and let her just be alone to do whatever she wants - whether that's watch a Netflix episode, take a nap, or even catch up on cleaning (if that's what she needs to do to feel satisfied)?
