Yoga pants were great when we left the hospital because I had no idea how much my stomach would shrink, so it was nice to not have to guess a size. Same with the top, I took a flowy T-shirt instead of maternity gear. A little makeup if you want to have it for pictures. I went without, I did not have the energy for primping. I don't regret it, but I don't usually wear much makeup anyways. Clothes to rake baby home in (newborn and 0-3mo, just in case) I also had an outfit for his first pictures, though they usually do those in just a diaper so you don't really need it. \n\nFlip flops, ear plugs, sleep mask, chapstick. Must haves. I got everything but the flip flops on day 3, with only about 1 hour of sleep a night the previous three nights it made a HUGE difference.  Also the hospital air is hot and dry so even though I don't normally use chapstick I NEEDED it there. Nipple butter that doesn't need to be wiped off served the same purpose for baby's poor little tiny chapped lips. Even if you don't breastfeed, a little on a fingertip will help. \n\nEntertainment. Yes, you will be swept up in a world of love for your LO and SO and guests will be visiting through the day, but the nights are long. Since I couldn't sleep, even when my baby and husband were, I took my laptop and ended up working during labor and at night. I used my phone for reading and redditing as well as just constantly taking pictures and videos of the baby. \n\nBag for SO, including blanket and pillow. Make sure your pillow case is NOT white, the hospital staff may take it accidentally if it is. Have cash, too. My hospital included my meals but not his, he could order, but it cost extra and had to be paid in cash. He also did runs for donuts, coffee, and a couple of trips to subway. \n\n Check with your hospital about care supplies,  unless they are provided (mine were) you'll want padsicles + period panties or adult diapers + Tucks pads. Tylenol, ibuprofen, whatever you prefer. Ask your doctor or nurse if and when you can take it, but have your own, the hospital charges stupid amounts for them. I have $1,200 in charges from the hospital pharmacy and that does *not* include the epidural. Dermaplast was supplied by my hospital and that stuff was great for numbing. Peri bottle is a must, though I can't imagine the hospital not supplying them. Also check if they supply diapers and wipes for the baby.

Luckily, lo decided she didn't want to leave the safe confines of the womb ahead of schedule, and actually came at midnight the day after we planned! \nI WAY overpacked, but that's normal for me. Things I definitely used: chapstick! comfy pants for recovery. Having a bag of all my usual toiletries in mini bottles was a big deal too. It helped me feel human again to have a somewhat usual shower/get dressed routine. Lansinoh if you plan to breastfeed - omg so much lansinoh in the beginning!

My lo was long and lean, and 0-3M size was HUGE on her! Vaseline! If you put some on your baby's butt it helps make it easier to wipe the meconium those first several diapers. \nAs far as labor...I really hated this thing, but it sped things up significantly for me - a peanut shaped medicine ball. The nurse put it between my knees and off she went. It was SO uncomfortable, I buzzed her right away and asked to remove it. I had an epidural so I couldn't really get it myself, otherwise I think I would've destroyed it. She convinced me to give her 45min with it. I made it 45, buzzed her and said I felt nauseous and a ton of pressure...I was fully dilated at that point and ready to go! I was a 6/7 when the peanut was first brought out. I hated it, but it sure worked for me! Don't be afraid to ask for pain relief. I was for the longest time until my OB said don't be a hero. I got 2 doses of fentanyl, but the 2nd didn't do much as my contractions were so strong from the induction meds. They offered an epidural and I took it. I was 13hrs in at that point. Should've done it sooner! Once I got it, I was able to nap! That was a huge help for the road ahead! I didn't get too strong of a dose, and it ran out by the time I was ready to push so I had some feeling. That was a big help too actually. I could feel my contractions and when to push. Do what feels right for you!! I don't know how people watched Netflix while in labor...I couldn't focus while my contractions were so intense, and when I got the epidural sleep was more of a priority!

A comfy short robe that ties to wear after birth. Quick coverage if you have vistors, easy access to nurse the baby and wont get tangled around your feet. \n\n2. Comfortable underwear and your favorite heavy flow pads. The ones the hospital provide arent usually up to par.\n\n3. Non-slip socks. \n\n4. Everything you need for a cleansing shower. I never messed with styling during these times but a shower with your own soaps after labor is magical.\n\n5. Baby stuff. Blankets ( 2), hat, socks, 2-4 outfits(i never used more than 2 but babies are messy) for baby clothes i recommend a long sleeve sleeper gown like this style https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B01NCXKVBK/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1502546691&amp;sr=8-1&amp;pi=AC_UL420_SR280,420_QL65&amp;keywords=long+sleeve+sleeper+gown+baby\n\nEasy access to diaper.

Bring clothes in size newborn and 3 months. its hard to know how big they will be. Both my boys were born into size 3m. Both 11 lbs.\n\n6. Super extra comfy shoes for dad who will likely be on his feet for extended time periods. a simple overnight bag for dad.\n\n7. birth plan and a list of people and their phone numbers who get texts or calls after the birth. You likely wont be using your phone for a while. Atleast not until the adrenaline wears off and you take nap.\n\n8. Comfy outfit for you and baby to go home in.
