For me \"touched out\" is caused more by an imbalance between those than just too much touching.  \nSex is generally a combination of both. Unfortunately for some women sex is unbalanced towards giving touch (especially when our libidos are low. A BJ just to shut up his whining is definitely giving not receiving touch). So my advice is take some time to figure out how to balance both your sex life (get a little selfish!) and your daily life (leave baby with dad and get that pedi!) so that you get the reciving replenishing touch *you* need.  \nAlso, don't feel guilty if your libido doesn't come back until your period does (may be until weaning). That's mother nature's way of spacing babies. Good nutrition and night weaning (or a relief bottle pumped in the early AM and fed over night by hubs) may help get aunt flo and your libido back.", "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "created_utc": 1563099958, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "gildings": {}, "id": "etqs5bf", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_ccx0yj", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_ccx0yj", "permalink": "/r/Mommit/comments/ccx0yj/how_to_be_intimate_when_sleep_deprived_and/etqs5bf/", "retrieved_on": 1563099960, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3", "total_awards_received": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "approved_at_utc": null, "author": "yellowseahorse4", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_iptc1p3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "banned_at_utc": null, "body": "Can you try to also sleep until 4/5 am getting up with the baby when they wake up?

I get this. My little one is about to hit six months.  When I was still healing, staying at home with her, and was feeling exhausted and touched out my hubs didn't even bring this up. Your husband is a grown human, he can fend for himself. That's not to say there aren't other ways to be intimate. \n\nWhen your husband comes home, hand off the babe and go take 15 minutes to yourself in the shower. I swear, it helps so much when you're touched out to just go have the water beat on you and it's soothing. When you're done, you'll feel better and be able to tolerate a hug or two at least. You guys need to have a chat about how you're feeling, especially that you're feeling guilty. Talking about it is going to help a lot more than just thinking about it. I promise, I do this too.  If you tell him what's going on in your head he's going to understand and tell you not to worry about it. You're still healing from making that tiny human. Your body, hormones, and mental state are running to capacity and they've been in a constant state of upheaval for about a year. It takes time to physically heal, mentally adjust, and emotionally settle after that. Truly. This isn't just you. I had really bad PPD, and after we found meds that work for me I started to feel better, but it still took me until 4 to 5 months pp to start feeling normal ish. My hips still ache...Now at 6 months, hubs and I are pros and things are a lot calmer around here. My LO also had really awful reflux and she started to grow out of that around 4 months, and sleeping far better than any baby has any right to because of it. You guys will get there. You'll find your groove and it won't be so overwhelming, but in the meantime ask him for patience and understanding because, honestly, you just don't have it in you right now. The want is there, and you want to take care of him too, but ask him how else you can help take care of him. Don't force yourself to be physically intimate. It won't be fun for you and it won't be fun for him either. And you both deserve to enjoy that special private time. \n\nThere is a huge period of adjustment, and while you're in it, it's hell. But it ends. And there is a light at the end of the tunnel. You will get to have sex again.  Your baby will one day sleep longer than 10 minutes and be more independent. You will have more you time in the future. Right now, you just have to make it through however possible, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that and your husband is going to understand. Talk to him. Be honest. Ask him how you can take care of him in the meantime. Find out what your love languages are. But give yourself a break. You're a wreck of a human right now, you're a new sleep deprived mama. Cut yourself a little more slack, because your responsibilities just tripled and you're still figuring out where to fit everything in. You're not broken. You're not faulty. You're adjusting.

I am pretty much never in the mood for sex, but enjoy it once we get going, so I basically schedule it as a goal for myself.  Sometimes I'll have a glass of wine to unwind and I'll also give myself a \"pass\" on some nightly chores (dishes, laundry, etc) to reserve what energy I have when the kids are asleep.  Using lube and keeping my entire chest area off limits (I'm breastfeeding) helps me be comfortable for the deed itself.  \n\nAnd basic nonsexual intimacy (cuddling, hugging as a whole family) and simple love language exchanges (kind words, working together on basic household tasks, having him do something thoughtful like some outstanding chores, having conversations about our relationship and future) all help me feel more connected to my husband, which in turn makes sexual intimacy more appealing I'm a general sense.", "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "created_utc": 1563127796, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "gildings": {}, "id": "etrrwx6", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_ccx0yj", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_ccx0yj", "permalink": "/r/Mommit/comments/ccx0yj/how_to_be_intimate_when_sleep_deprived_and/etrrwx6/", "retrieved_on": 1563127797, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3", "total_awards_received": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "approved_at_utc": null, "author": "poca_loca", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_yjqyytr", "author_patreon_flair": false, "banned_at_utc": null, "body": "This is exactly the list I was going to post.
