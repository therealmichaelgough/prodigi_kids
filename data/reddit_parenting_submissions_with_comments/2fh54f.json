My MIL is being very thoughtful and loves buying stuff for her kids (and now grandchild).  More often than not we end up with things we aren't going to use or that just take up space.  \n\nI should mention that she has no concept of clutter. She and my FIL probably still have everything they have ever brought ever, as well as stuff that other people were getting rid of.  Currently I know they are on their way down with a 25 year old Little Tykes slide that her youngest son had.  Her kitchen is over flowing with gadgets that are for one specific function.  Last time she was out here she randomly got us a salt block for cooking food on. It is neat, but pointles and takes up space. We barely have room for the things we DO use, let alone something that we will use once as a gimmick.\n\nI would like to nip this in the bud now before it becomes a bigger issue with my daughter, but want to do so as nicely as possible.  I know she is just being thoughtful so I don't want to insult her.  She can sometimes take things the wrong way and be very passive-aggressive about it.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nEdit:  As this is getting bigger than I expected, I am going to start listing some of the suggestions from below for the people coming here for that reason.\n\n- Being honest and forward about not needing things.  Many below have tried this and it has either worked with mixed results or hasn't worked at all.  Eventually you may just need to gently hurt feelings by returning items to stores, donating them to Goodwill, or flat out sending them back with the giver.\n\n- Have them keep the toys at their house.  This would work especially well if you are visiting them a lot or your child stays there a lot.  In our case they are 8 hours away so it isn't a good option, especially since we are trying to keep them from adding mroestuff to their over-filled house.\n\n- Divert the energy from buying things into somethine else.  Experiences such as memberships to museums or zoos were one way to do this.  We belong to a Fine Arts museum that has art classes from infants on up, and so far they have been fun.  We may try and ask for gift certificates towards her classes.  College funds such as 529 plans that anyone can contribute to was another suggestion.\n\n- Flat out tell them exactly what you need.  As one person said \"I know you are awesome with finding things at garage sales. We could really use a ______. Call me if you see one!\" If they are the type that likes to buy things for people, they will likely just pay for it themselves.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Mommit - I need help dealing with my well-meaning MIL in regards to a minor issue.", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/2fh54f/mommit_i_need_help_dealing_with_my_wellmeaning/"}, "comments": [{"archived": true, "author": "goddesspyxy", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "I don't have the answer, but if you figure it out, please let me know.

Not just for the grand-kid either; she shops discount stores and will pick up random stuff for me or my husband as well. \n\nAlmost every visit to her house I come back with a large shopping bag of \"stuff\". I process the stuff as follows:\n\n* Some things will never be used. They immediately get posted to Kijiji (AKA Craigslist). A lot of the time I post the stuff as free, sometimes I post it for a bargain price. Examples: new (with tags) clothes that are too large (husband and I have lost weight, MIL still buys our 'old' sizes or has stockpiles of stuff in our old sizes). Also, I sold three of the SIX snowsuits that MIL bought for our son last year.\n\n* Some things can replace other things we already have. A new toy dump-truck means that one of the older or less-used dump trucks can go. \n\n* Some things we might get one or two uses out of. Then they too go on Kijiji. If MIL gave us a Little Tykes slide I'd probably let our son play with it for a day or two and then give it away after the novelty wore off.\n\n* The really nice, useful, or meaningful things are kept and used. \n\nI know that selling or giving away gifts can feel wrong, but this process has come about after we've made it clear that all this 'stuff' is too much and causes us stress and makes us unhappy.

Don't use the words \"useless,\" or \"crowded,\" or \"clutter\" as these will be seen as negatives. Also make it very personal - focus on yourself in this conversation and talk about how while you think all of the gadgets and one-use items are cool and can be very useful, you just don't have the room for it, and again, having too many possessions makes you stressed because you personally can't keep it organized. Don't give the impression that you feel that her home is unorganized or cluttered or over-crowded (even though it is). \n* Ask them to divert their funds into a larger/more expensive gift for your daughter that can be given to her on a holiday or her birthday, or even just straight up cash that can go into a college fund (I have a 529 account for my kids and outside people with the account number can \"donate\" to it).\n* If all else fails, just dump the \"junk\". Sell stuff you can make money from, donate stuff you can't but is usable to others, and toss the junk.
