The epidural helped me relax and then the real work started. Pushing was an enormous effort, not pain but sheer exhaustion. It felt like I had just run a marathon and now someone was forcing me to climb a mountain. When he was actually born it was such a relief just because I could finally rest. And then do it all over again 20 min later! Point being, you can do it. It isn't like being stabbed or shot or maimed. It's like your body flipping it's self inside out.

Inductions are suppose to be more painful than a natural labor. At that, I couldn't have any drugs due to a medical issue. \n\nMy labor was surprisingly fine. It took 6 hours and he came out without any tears. Contractions were fine until 4cm, then they broke my water which gave me a shitload of relief because the water added a lot of pressure. After that, my contractions came every few minutes and I was able to *understand* them. They felt like a ball of energy right in my lower abdomen. My contractions didn't radiate or anything, so it was just to the one area. When they were over I fell asleep for a few minutes. \n\nHeating pads were a god send. They were able to reduce any feeling of contractions by  *a lot*. You have to understand that any \"pain\" during labor isn't a pain from being injured, it's a pain with a goal. Contractions aren't very terrible. It's very very important to go in with a very positive mindset, and don't allow anyone to say negative things. I kicked my MIL out because she made negative comments about the pitocin, and I only wanted positive vibes. \n\nPushing doesn't hurt, so don't be afraid of that. Pushing is very reliving. When you push, you don't feel the contractions and there's no feeling below (perhaps due to adrenaline...I don't know why). Once the baby is out, it's completely and totally over. \n\nI had the worst fear of labor to the point where I took birth control all my life and had anxiety attacks just thinking about it. I worked out a lot during pregnancy and watched my weight in order to have a little personal control over things like having high blood pressure (which can be caused by excessive weight gain during pregnancy). \n\nI went into my labor knowing that everything would be nothing but peace, and no drama. Do not be afraid to kick people out who are making comments like \"glad I'm not giving birth\" or \"this is why I don't want kids\". ***NOTHING BUT POSITIVE ENERGY***. \n\nMy labor took 6 hours, and I had no tearing. Also, When I had contractions I breathed in very deeply and rocked my hips. Towards the end, I allowed myself to have a few screams which felt nice. But save those screams for the end. Contractions are NOT bad. Contractions are NOT scary. Labor was so good that I'm excited to get pregnant again, and this is coming from a rape survivor who has a lot of anxiety and fear about everything.\n\nYou can do this.

Another piece of wisdom my doctor told me, \"no woman has ever been pregnant forever!\"\n\nMy birthing experience was tough because he decided he wanted to come right as I laid down for bed that night, after being up all day. I didn't want to be one of \"those\" people who went to the hospital for false labor, so I waited..and waited..from 11pm - 3am. I had been at an appointment 6 days prior and was told I wasn't dilated at all. \n\nI finally decided it was probably best to head up there, and - lo and behold - I was 7cm dilated.  The nurse said \"looks like you're going home with a baby!!\" HOLY CRAP THIS JUST GOT REAL!!\n\nHowever, since I waited so long, I did not have time for an epidural. I had to pass an 8lb 11oz baby boy with nothing to help with pain. On top of being exhausted from now at this point being up for almost 24 hours.

The Dr told me to either get him out with the next push, or I was having an emergency C-section. Hearing that, and seeing the vitals line on the monitor freaking out, gave me the strength I needed! And there was my sweet little boy, Aiden James.\n\nYou don't know what true love, honestly unconditional love, is - until you see that little face you created.

The third trimester felt like this \"point of no return\" and while I looked forward to meeting my baby, I reeeeally didn't want to give birth. \n\nKnowledge is power has always been my approach to scary things, so I read up like crazy. I highly recommend the Bradley method book. We didn't do the class bc it was 12 weeks long, but the book had good pictures and information about stages of labor and what to expect an unmedicated birth to feel like. This really helped in the moment so I knew \"this is normal, don't panic, breath, ride the contraction waves\". \n\nReading a lot of birth stories was good too. Birth without fear is a great resource for this. Everyone is so different and it was good to hear lots of birth stories. I felt encouraged that even if things went poorly (emergency c-section was my fear), lots of babies are born this way and come out okay! That I'm not in any way a \"screw up\" bc I couldn't handle a natural labor or whatever if I decided I needed medication. There's definitely that vibe in the crunchy community, but it's bs. Do what's good for you and baby. Have a doctor you trust. \n\nI also took a short Lamaze style birth class which was good for laboring techniques to not overtire yourself. And what to expect with breastfeeding and early postpartum recovery. I was so wrapped up about the birth, I hadn't even thought about recovery much! I'm glad I heard some good tips and had my adult diapers and frozen witch hazel pads at home :P They helped a lot! \n\n\nFor me, labor itself was not painful until very close to pushing. My water broke around 2am and around 10am I started noticing mild period like cramping. It slowly intensified over the day and around 8pm the contractions were 1) close enough together (4 min I think?) 2)consistent 3)intense enough I couldn't talk through them anymore. So we drove to the birth center, we live about an hour away in the country, so we wanted to give plenty of time since I also reeeeally didn't want a home birth or a car birth! I labored there from 9pm-midnight. Pain management (mostly pressure in my lower back) was helped by swaying sitting on an exercise ball and hanging out in the shower with warm water hitting my lower back. I pushed for 3 hours (not bad for a first baby!) and that was by far the hardest. It didn't hurt to push per say, but it was exhausting and I felt sick, shaking and wanting to vomit. The last hour of pushing was painful and I was so tired. Was insanely happy when the baby came out and I could rest! My home recovery was good. Breastfeeding was hard. I had mastitis twice (think flu symptoms and painful nursing) and other issues. With a great lactation consultant we were able to heal up and continue nursing after a month or so of needing to supplement. That was scarier to me than giving birth. The problems felt unending and I was exhausted with a newborn who was losing weight :( We came out the other side ok and nursed over 2 years. I'm pregnant with #2 now and really hoping birth goes as smooth this time and maybe nursing won't be such a challenge.

I had to wait 6 hours after I requested the epidural to actually get it. \n\nHere's the thing: this idea that you have to wait till you're dilated til youre dilated to any particular size to get an epidural is an old, outmoded viewpoint! I work with anesthesiologists every day (I'm a surgical tech) and they were really angry on my behalf that they made me wait. The reasoning behind this common practice is that an epidural can sometimes slow down labor, but it usually doesn't, and if it does, all they have to do is give you pitocin! This is your choice.  If they tell you they recommend you wait and you don't want to, you tell them that you understand the risks, and theyre relatively minor compared to the pain, and you would like to get your epidural now, please.  \n\nAlso, even if your only considering an epidural, fill out all the paperwork consenting to it As soon as you arrive, as it takes time for the nurses to process it and you dpwont want to fill it out when you're in pain. That way, as soon as you decide to get it, you can. See? You don't have to be in pain, even at the beginning! Nothing to fear! Once mine went in, I didn't feel a thing. And all I felt of the epidural was the burn of local anesthetic. Not bad.
