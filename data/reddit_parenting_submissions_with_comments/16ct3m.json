However, I just found out that the family doesn't vaccinate their children. \n\nMy initial response is that I don't want to have them in close contact with my daughter due to this- but is that good science? They're not vaccinated, does having them in contact with my daughter put her at greater risk? I'm having trouble thinking my way through it. She'll only be 3 months old, so she won't have had a full course of vaccines yet anyway.\n\nI'm doing googling now, but I'd appreciate any insight any of you have into this. \n\nEDIT: Based on my research and the responses, I think I'll say I'm not comfortable having them around her until she's finished her infant schedule. Its a bummer because they are great kids and would be great for her. Thanks for the responses everyone, and for largely staying polite.
