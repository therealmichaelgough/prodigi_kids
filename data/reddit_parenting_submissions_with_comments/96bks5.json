Distance does actually highly correlate to risk in this scenario. While yes, you are more likely to be in an accident close to home, that\u2019s because the vast majority of the driving people do is close to home. According to the NHTSA car accidents n=1 is approximately every 165,000 miles. So, your child\u2019s risk of accident was something like 1 in 330k or .0003% for a trip of .6 a mile. As a mom, I get that there are times when any unnecessary risk feels awful, but mathematically your parents weren\u2019t gambling that much. And to be clear, those numbers are for being in an accident which also includes accidents with no injuries , so the real number is lower. Maybe instead of coming down harshly on them, a reasonable chat would be in order.

My SUV is safer and the car seat is already installed with the mirror.\n\nThere are so many other options here, and riding in a car without a car seat just shouldn't have been one, in my opinion.
