And if you're doing it safely (and clearly looking to do it more safely since you're here asking others for tips) you have no reason to feel guilty!\n\nMy little guy is nearly 1 year and we've co-slept his whole life. Initially we did it because my body was physically healing so slowly and it was too hard to get up every hour or two to nurse him during growth spurts. Sidelying nursing was a game changer, I could roll over and fall asleep every time. I think we all slept better this way, which made our days easier to handle.\n\nI'm usually pretty reserved but being a parent changed that in some ways, and I have no problem telling people why we choose to bedshare (among other personal parenting choices) because we do it safely and I've done my research. I love it. My husband and I didn't really discuss when it would end, and it is naturally still happening without affecting our marriage.\n\nTo do it safely: When he was newborn he was on our king size between us on his his blanket with a waterproof mattress pad beneath it. My husband and I would use different blankets, I kept mine waist-high and wore a warmer top when needed, LO didn't have a blanket. We kept all pillows and blankets away from him. Since maybe 8 months on he shares our duvet no problem, but pillows are off to the side.

We had a rolled up towel between baby and hubby so that he'd feel the towel before reaching the baby. Mama has the hormones to stay aware of baby. I breastfed on demand and because he was a summer baby we had a lot of skin to skin. I would actually wake up just moments before him for every feed so I could go pee first.\n\nFrom 1mo-18mo we had the crib side-cared to our queen bed. We waited that long to attach it because it took a month for me to be able to crawl into bed after the delivery. Baby would nurse and I'd slide him back to his mattress. If he was teething or sick then he spent more time on our mattress, if all was well he was content on the crib mattress. Around 10mo he started going to his bed on his own after nursing at bedtime. It was also great for those middle of the night party times because I could make a wall with my body so that I could feel if he came out of the crib and I didn't have to be fully awake. \n\nFrom 18mo- 2.5y we had our queen mattress in the floor with a twin mattress. Toddler slept on his bed most of the night and if he needed more snuggles he'd climb over me and sleep between us. I night weaned soon after he turned 2 and we were able to continue Co-sleeping comfortably.\n\nSoon after night weaning we started talking about getting a big kid bed and that he'll have toys in his bedroom (the second bedroom had been used as a play room until he moved in there). He helped choose the bed, helped put it together and started sleeping on his own really easily. We talked about it for a good 6 month before actually doing it so he was really expecting it and was very excited. On the first night he called me twice and I snuggled him back to sleep and within a week he was sleeping all night on his own. He still comes into our bed occasionally in the middle of the night and we're 100% OK with that. Sometimes he just needs extra snuggles.\n\nSo, those people who are trying you that your newborn needs to be on their own? No. You know your baby and what they need. Baby is still so new and still in that 4th trimester. They need so much touch and love at this point because that's all they know. When you're ready, baby can transition to its own bed or own room but don't let others make that decision for you.

What's the difference between an adult mattress and a baby one, really? It's not voodoo here. Keep sober, keep away suffocation hazards. Couches are a no-go because they have that soft back babies can get trapped in. Sleep meds are a no-go. Siblings that can't follow the rules, dogs that can't follow the rules, probably shouldn't sleep next to baby either. \n\nFor your specific situation, if you wanted to make it safer, you could have yourself wear a cardigan or open hoodie on your chest and baby wear clothes and not have the sheet on him. The bed could be lowered to be closer to the ground. Some people swear by pool noodles under the sheet as bumpers, and some people get those toddler barriers to tuck in the side of their bed. I wouldn't worry about the baby sleeping on your chest, everything I've heard has said that the rise and fall of the mother's breathing helps baby regulate their breathing, so it's not at all the same sids risk as sleeping face down on their own.
