Something clearly needs to be done.  But I believe that there are 2 components to a shooting... A gun and a person.  The gun isn't going to shoot itself, so the problem begins with the person. I am an advocate for the second amendment, however I do not oppose more strict regulation and more thorough background checks.  This recent shooting involved someone who has had previous mental health related disturbances, and therefore should have never been allowed to buy a gun.\n\nAlso, I live in South Louisiana and come from a family of hunters.  I grew up around guns.  People need to be educated on gun safety BEFORE buying a gun.  Maybe enforce education courses to potential first time buyers on gun safety? Also, I do not have any family members (and some are serious hunters) that have deemed it necessary to utilize an AR-15 for hunting purposes.  Due to the popularity of this gun with the mentally unstable, I wouldn't be opposed to limiting it's sales.  \n\nA key thing to remember is that no laws or gun bans will stop someone with the mindset to kill.  Schools are gun free zones yet these crimes occur.  If we didn't have guns,they'd find something else.  That's why I think mental health needs to take priority (also metal detectors). I work Ina hospital and it sickens me to see these mentally unstable patients being discharged all while knowing they will be back soon.  The government lacks adequate funding for mental health and that needs to be addressed.  \n\nAnd lastly, while I consider myself an advocate for the first amendment, please know that I see a problem here too and recognize that a change needs to happen. My heart breaks for victoms of gun violence and my prayers are with the families at this difficult time.

I feel you. \nI'm a mental health counselor. There was an article on the front page today about mental health reforms not really changing anything related to violence such as we are discussing, and I agree with that. In fact, I've been talking to my clients all week about it. Angry men and boys almost never get help. Period. Therapy as it stands today is- for some cultural reason- almost intolerable for men.  In my 15 yr career with the most sick individuals in my regions, I have never met with a person who wanted to kill people. They just don't seek help. \nI feel like the real solution here is teaching our children emotional intelligence and coping skills. Anger is not an emotion-- it's a reaction- a way to vent fear, sadness, shame, or other emotions you can't manage. I feel kind of helpless when I say that I worry that it may be kind of late for our generation to learn these things as a whole (some people do and can-- but how many men do you know that actually go to therapy? It's usually women)-- but we can teach our kids. Millennials, as shamed as they are for 'safe spaces', etc, have caught on and ask for what they need emotionally. My practice is full of them and I see that as a great sign. \n\nMamas. Teach your children how to feel. Teach them to ask for help when they need it. Teach your boys that anger is ok- but its a sign of something else, then help them figure out what that issue may be so they can solve it. We CAN change the world. It's just our kids who will do it for us.  Don't move. Be brave. Speak up. Vote.  Have healthy relationships. Show them how.  Let the fear motivate you to do better instead of freeze. &lt;3\n", "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "created_utc": 1518791556, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "duc90wf", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7xv3eo", "parent_id": "t3_7xv3eo", "permalink": "/r/Mommit/comments/7xv3eo/heartbroken_angry_but_mostly_terrified/duc90wf/", "retrieved_on": 1518791557, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"approved_at_utc": null, "author": "Okuhou", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": "green", "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Esca born 22 Sep 2011"}], "author_flair_text": "Esca born 22 Sep 2011", "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "richtext", "banned_at_utc": null, "body": "I am in another country and it's awesome.

I'm pregnant with #2. Oddly enough, or not really at all considering how frequently mass shootings happen in the last 10 years or so, I had JUST texted my friend on TUESDAY about being scared to send my kids to school and that I was considering homeschooling.\n\nI graduated in '07, after Columbine, but school shootings were not common yet at all. I was scared back then, but also felt that it was unlikely to happen to me or my school personally. 10 years later, and now with my own children, I am terrified and devastated every school shooting I hear about. I can hardly utter the words \"Sandy Hook\" without completely weeping. I feel like it could happen to any school, anywhere, and there's nothing parents can really do. The video footage of the shooting on Wednesday particularly shook me. I could easily place myself in a classroom with those students, and even worse, I could easily place my daughter in that classroom. It is so much different than when I was in school.\n\nI'm really middle of the road on gun control. I agree that it is TOO easy to get a gun, also far too easy to give a gun as a gift to someone who may have hidden a mental issue from you well. I live in Maine, where gun laws are very lax. Mainers are very pro-guns in general. And there have never been any school shootings in Maine. There were two instances somewhat recently, within the last 5 years IIRC, of guns being fired on school grounds. Both were suicides and both were not in the schools but just on the property. Perhaps a part of that is that many Mainers are stringent with gun safety. We had our guns locked in a safe, and always unloaded, even before our daughter was born.\n\nI think there's more than one facet to this problem. Guns are too easy to get, I can agree to that. But what is extremely DIFFICULT to get is healthcare, particularly of the mental health variety. I've been there. Hell, I'm still there even with medicaid. I saw someone post on facebook this week something along the lines of \"access to guns is a constitutional right but access to healthcare is a privilege\" and it rang very true to me. As far as I can tell, nothing at all has changed for the better since mass shootings have become more common and that is possibly more concerning than anything else.

My husband was offered a job at a software company in Vancouver. (Un)fortunately, I can't tell you too much what the move was like since the company handled everything: travel; packing our apartment, shipping our car, helping us find a place, paperwork, etc. They made it really easy. They got us here on a two-year work visa (they handled that too) and they are now working on getting us permanent residence status. It's really hard to move/live out here without a job that brings you here or a student visa so if you can get that opportunity, go for it.\n\nThe housing market is awful. It was literally just ranked as the 3rd worst in the world. Chinese investors are buying up everything. There are ~1000 sq ft homes going for $1.6 million in the neighborhood I live in (East Van). We have no hope of buying a home near the city. Even homes in the Surrey/Langley area (over an hour commute) are in the high six figures. Yes, its CAD, not USD, but my husband is paid in CAD, so that's our life now. \n\nWhich brings me to the job market. There are jobs, mostly because the middle and lower class can't afford to live here anymore. However, salary is also one of the lowest in North America. My husband took a sizable cut in salary despite a higher position, and then you have to factor in the CAD-USD conversion. \n\nThat being all said, we do really like it here. It's true that people are so much friendlier here. There are parks everywhere, in almost every neighborhood. We have a big one a block away. The weather this season has been great, even coming from Santa Monica. There are great retail neighborhoods we walk to a lot. We also have the huge bog box stores close by too (Costco, Canadian Superstore, Walmart, Petsmart, Safeway, Whole Foods, Ikea). I do miss Target and Trader Joes, but we cross the border to Washington regularly to hit them up and get gas (gas is expensive here). I'm still struggling to make friends so my day to day is mainly spent around the house, going for walks in the neighborhood, running errands.\n\nIf Hillary had won, we probably would've stayed in the US. It wasn't an easy choice. It was hard knowing we could take the job in Texas, buy a home within a year, and be saving a good chunk of money every month, or, we move to a foreign country and hope everything works out. But I'm glad we did it. Knowing our daughter is a Dual Citizen has been great. And the healthcare really is amazing. Everything from Prenatal, Labor and Delivery, to Postnatal care, was covered.
