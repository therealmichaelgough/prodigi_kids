It was such a pain in the butt to figure out and in the meantime I felt so bad for her. I would take a week at a time and do elimination, with dairy eliminated it seemed to help the most - but it didn't totally clear up. But for the last couple months (she is 16 months) it has mostly gone away, a few spots on her chin every so often and that is with us both eating dairy.\n\nI was told she would probably grow out of it, so I prayed she would. From what I understand most kids do. There is that Cerecil (?sp?) stuff that a lot of people use, but as someone with adult eczema that worried me (so chemically) so I used this burts bees wonderful cream and it helped her but didn't heal it. So from what I unsderstand he will likely grow out of it and you may be able to try an elimination diet (for both of you) to see if it helps and you can start from dairy. There is a chance he can have it for life, but hopefully (and most likely) he will grow out of it. Hope that is somewhat helpful, best of luck!

Look at what you do on a daily or weekly basis and see how you feel while you do it.  Playing with your children, taking care of yourself, and taking care of your family although broad categories show how you mother.  \n\nAnother big thing for me is to learn which naysayers are just being jealous/over-controlling and which ones are actually looking out for our family.
