Went to bed around 8:30 with son (he's 5 months old - 2 months preemie, so he's 3 months corrected). He wouldn't get to sleep. Finally when he did, I couldn't. Usually he'll wake up to eat, then go right back to sleep, but not this night. He woke up 4 more times, I fed him, he fussed and fussed then finally went back to sleep. \nAround 6:30 my 4 year old son came into our bed which isn't unusual because he gets itchy from eczema. baby was fussing a little bit but I knew with snuggles he'd be fine. I asked hubby to snuggle him and he got frustrated and said \"I have to be up in an hour!\" I said \"I have to be up in 2 hours and you've slept all night, I haven't\". he snapped \"I don't care if you don't sleep! I have to work!\" I said \"oh gee, thanks.\" and rolled over to 4 year old, leaving baby with him. Baby kept fussing and hubby snapped again that he needed to feed. I didn't think so but I nursed him a bit anyways and gave him back. he kept fussing. Hubby asked if I gave him both sides, I said no, he's not hungry. Baby kept fussing, hubby AGAIN snaps \"Why is he doing this\"? I said he's been doing it all night, he just needs to be held and maybe rocked. \"Did you ever think that's maybe because he's HUNGRY?!?!?!\" \nSo I got mad and took baby back, put him on my arm, rubbed his cheek and he went to sleep in about 10 minutes. Meanwhile 4 year old is whining for hugs and hubby is snoring. Hubby gets up at 7:30, I sleep for a half hour and the boys wake up.\n\nSo, I got about 5 hours of sleep last night - if that - and hubby got about 9, and he \"doesn't care\".\nFML", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "No sleep and mad at hubby", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/19caim/no_sleep_and_mad_at_hubby/", "user_reports": []}, "comments": [{"archived": true, "author": "MackP33", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "I feel your pain!

My husband is generally the nicest guy and a great dad to our almost 3 yr old. Even when he's tired he tries to take over for me when he gets home (at least a little) because I'm pregnant and exhausted. We alternate sleeping in one day a week on the weekends and make breakfast for each other on those days so overall I'd say I know I'm super lucky. \n\nThat being said, he can be such a jerk when he's sleep deprived. Our son didn't sleep through the night for 13 months. In the beginning he helped alot, as it dragged on he just couldn't. It's like he couldnt think or function without 5+hours of sleep so when he would wake up at night he wouldn't help anymore. I guess I'm echoing other people but I just want to say that guys seem to think that we need less sleep than them. We have a spare bedroom and he keeps referencing that on nights that he \"needs\" sleep he will go sleep there to escape the baby. I actuallly remarked today after he said \"I will need sleep for work honey\" I responded \"So basically what I'm hearing is that you don't think I need sleep for the work I do taking care of a newborn and a 3 yr old?\". And he's like \"of course thats not what I mean\" and I said, \"by stating that you need to sleep for your JOB and leaving me high and dry with no sleep it tells me you don't think I need sleep for my JOB\". Obviously we are talking about it b4 the baby is here (2 weeks!) and we aren't sleep deprived yet (well I am bc I cant sleep this prego). but I guess my advice  is just that even if your husband is a great guy normally like mine, that sleep deprivation just affects them sooooo much more for some reason. I tried last time to just let it go if he snapped at me every now and then, if its a continual problem you need to absolutely talk to him about it. Snapping back, arguing, or being passive aggressive will not get you anywhere but more upset.  Have faith, it will pass! and hopefully he is nicer through out the day.
