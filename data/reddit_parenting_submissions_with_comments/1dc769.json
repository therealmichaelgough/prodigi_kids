Mine got smaller (like g to dd) but in the last year they got bigger again (just before I became pregnant with number 2). I'm hoping they don't do the same scale up this time around (I was a B before I had my daughter =X), because I just bought new bras!

A month later, I didn't always get sore when I went out with my daughter in the car. Two months later, I could stand for longer than 15 minutes without having to lie down for an hour or two. It took several more months before I could do pretty much everything I was able to do before the birth without having to stop. But it wasn't until at least a year and a half later that I stopped getting sore when I did the toddler squat for longer than a minute or two.\n\nI have loose skin on my belly that is never going to go away. Faded, but still visible, stretch marks starting between my bra band and my belly button, all the way down to mid-calf. I lost 18 pounds while breastfeeding (including the 10 pregnancy pounds I had left when my weight stabilized after the birth) but not until I started counting calories at about 5 months postpartum, and it took forever because I am very impulsive.\n\nSo I never did, and don't think I ever will, feel back to my pre-pregnant self. But I did get comfortable in my postpartum body. It was a very gradual process: first I started being able to move around like I used to, stopped bleeding, got a little more sleep, got the general idea of breastfeeding, was able to move around more and stand for longer, got more sleep, got more of the hang of breastfeeding, lost weight, got breastfeeding down pat. That last one happened at about six months. I think it also helped when my daughter was only waking up once or twice a night. I never minded until she was a little over a year old.\n\nI never felt like my body wasn't mine while nursing, nor do I while pregnant. I choose to do with my body as I did/do -- I use it for the purposes I want to use it for. My body is an extension of myself and a tool that I use to live my life.

I was only 21,and figured my metabolism could keep up with my hotdogs ad chocolate milk indulgence.... But oh how wrong I was. \n\nNow I think of them as my battle scars, and they are just a part of my beautiful body. I determined that for me, a tummy tuck scar would be less attractive than just leaving the skin to be. Many women before us have bore these badges of motherhood, and we shall bear them too, and we shall be beautiful! ;) \n\nLike I said, if you're ever feeling down, shoot me a message. And to take it easy on the exercise, mostly listen to your body. If something feels painful, or makes you feel dizzy, or kind of funny, or causes you to start bleeding, or bleeding to increase if you haven't stopped yet, it's a good idea to back off for a bit. \n\nGood luck!
