Lately, it's been getting harder and harder to get my Son back when I want him.\nstarting Oct. 23 I've been trying to get in contact with His father but he hasn't answered my texts, calls or voice mails about me picking up my Son and nor does his girlfriend. Their mother-in-law hasn't heard from them in days either. I've texted and called everyone for six days straight to no avail. I literally do not know the whereabouts of my Son or his father. I have their address which is an hour away from me and when I go and show up, nobody is home. I call from different phones but no answer. I'm terrified that something has happened and I'm upset because I feel as though I'm just overreacting. Is there some legal action I can take, or something I can do? I'm just stuck.\n\n~~UPDATE~~\n\n~~I called the police and they said because i willingly gave them to him for visitation and didn't set a return date, so apparently there is nothing they can do. It was APD though and I'm in Fulton county. Should I contact the county that my ex lives in?~~\n\n~~Update~~\n\n~~I called his Mom yesterday and pretty much lied to her saying if he didn't contact me within 24 hours, the police will put out a warrant for him on kidnapping.~~\n~~She started repeating what I was saying as if letting someone else in the room know what was going on.~~\n~~She called a bit ago saying how she is going to their house within the hour to get him to call me so I can \"call off the charge\" because they don't have the money to get him out.~~\n~~I'm waiting on the call and if it doesn't come, I'll call the police to at least do the welfare check you guys tipped me on.\nI really do appreciate the help everyone.~~\n\n***Update***\n\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/12fne8/conclusion_to_i_have_no_idea_where_my_son_is/", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I have no idea where my son is...", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/12bx5o/i_have_no_idea_where_my_son_is/", "user_reports": []}, "comments": [{"archived": true, "author": "snowlion13", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "wow, ive never been in this situation before, can you call the police? once i got him back i would not let him have him again until its in writing from the court. i hope you can get a response from someone whos been through this", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1351590503, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "c6ts48w", "link_id": "t3_12bx5o", "parent_id": "t3_12bx5o", "removal_reason": null, "retrieved_on": 1435673985, "score": 7, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"archived": true, "author": "amber2pto", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "If you have sole custody you should be able to call the police.
