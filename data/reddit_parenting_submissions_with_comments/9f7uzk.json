I'm looking for some insight. I have never had any internal inkling to be a mother, yet, now that I'm about to turn 30 I am wondering about motherhood.

Which, maybe tells me that motherhood isn't for me OR perhaps I am not looking at the whole picture. I have little experience around children or mothers so I don't really know what motherhood really entails/looks like. \n\nAnyway, I am just wondering how the moms on here decided they wanted to be mothers?

Am I doing this with the right person? Are we ready to be more selfless?\n\nI wasn\u2019t the type of woman that knew I was made for motherhood. I was 32 when I had my first and my husband and I had been together for 7 years (only married for 1 when we found out I was pregnant). We sowed our wild oats in those 7 years and during that time I learned he could be an amazing dad and partner. I didn\u2019t want a man who wasn\u2019t in the trenches with me, but it\u2019s different for everyone. What they want from their partner is different so you should think about if you want a partner in it with you and what roll you would want them to play and what role they want to play. \n\nAlso consider if you\u2019re both ready to be more selfless. Babies are a lot of work and toddlers are very good and trying their parent\u2019s patience. I used to be very impatient and it was something I worked a lot on before I had kids. By the time we did get pregnant I felt like I was the most prepared I have ever been. I just had my second a week ago and it\u2019s a rough transition from one to two. But even during the newborn fog and sleep deprivation I am finding happiness and knowing it will get easier. I know we made the right choice and we\u2019re totally killing it! \n\nThe answer will probably be different for everyone. I wish you luck in whatever you decide!

It\u2019s my body and I know what I want\u201d types.\n\nI turned 30 and showed up to planned parenthood for a Pap smear and maybe a yeast infection or something.  The question suddenly changed from \u201cdo you want a refill on those pills?\u201d  to \u201cdo you think you\u2019re ever going to want to have babies?\u201d, I snapped a well-rehearsed \u201cno\u201d at the nurse and by the time I got to my car I thought \u201c...but, maybe\u201d\n\nAbout a year and a half later I\u2019m finishing up nursing school, broken up with a sweet but disastrous man, and out dancing.  A gorgeous caramel colored dreamboat approaches me and asks me to dance.  During the first song we dance together he asks if I have children and then tells me I should have his.  I cackled.  He enjoys recounting this cackle to his friends now.\n\nNow, 2.5 years of knowing this guy and 2 years of it being married I have a beautiful baby boy and not a single regret about the kiddo.\n\nThere was a miscarriage before this guy showed up.  The hubs and I had some ugly fighting (both pretty torn up about it) and I got a depo shot because of it.  Things settled down and I just let the shot wear off and then it was a frustrating waiting game to get pregnant again.  Soon as I stopped thinking about it, I was pregnant again.  \n\nI switched from night shift to day shift  when I got married and left behind the partying lifestyle that was how my husband and I met - causes a rift sometimes, but I am doing better at the adult responsibilities and don\u2019t miss the hangovers.  With the higher nursing degree I was able to get some financial stability and buy a house, a real fixer upper but it still causes a sense of readiness for baby.  I\u2019ve got a stable full-time job with good insurance for baby and I, which has always been important to me - ability to take care of myself and baby in case the daddy didn\u2019t work out.\n\nI don\u2019t think ready is a realistic thing when it comes to having babies.  I\u2019m still asking hubs to patch that hole in the wall before baby starts walking.

I\u2019m more in love with this little dude than I knew possible to love anything.  \n\nYou\u2019ll never feel totally prepared, but it will all be okay anyway.  You make it up as you go along.  You find resources.  Take classes, find mommy groups to join, call the lactation consultant, talk to the woman at the market with the wisdom to calm your nerves and help you focus in on what\u2019s important.  You don\u2019t have to have any experience.  \n\nLife\u2019s short and babies are beautiful (at least mine is!) \n\nMight as well jump!

We waited for marriage until we both graduated college; and I made it clear I didn\u2019t want to start a family until I got my Master\u2019s Degree.

For example, instead of saying we have a bad dog because she busted out of her kennel and destroyed a basket of games we had in the living room leaving tiny shards of plastic and basket bits shredded across the living room, I tried to remind myself that she\u2019s a young dog and she has separation anxiety. It\u2019s not her fault her brain is wired that way, she can\u2019t help herself. Or at work when I wasn\u2019t getting promoted fast enough I\u2019d try to turn it inward and say what else can I do to improve myself so they can\u2019t possibly overlook me. I tried basically framing things that frustrated me differently. That jerk who cut me off is probably late to a doctor appt, I know I hate being late.\n\nAnother thing that helps is reading up on toddler discipline. Up until my first son was about 16 or 17 months he was such a delight. He listened so good and was a helper, he loved to be involved in chores we did and wanted to help out and try it for himself. Then suddenly he became this...toddler. He would do exactly what you asked him to not do, with a big grin on his face. It can be infuriating, especially if he\u2019s doing something that could get himself hurt. I read up on toddler brain development and social development and it helped me understand that he\u2019s not doing it to be defiant, his brain is wired to push boundaries. It\u2019s apart of his learning autonomy to test what he can get away with. Sadly, the literature says they don\u2019t really understand consequences to actions until they\u2019re close to two. So saying you\u2019ll punish them if they don\u2019t stop doing whatever isn\u2019t a concept their brains understand so your basically stuck redirecting them until they get close to two or show signs of understanding consequences. I guess it helps me keep my cool knowing he can\u2019t help it. His brain isn\u2019t mature enough to be doing this to make my life difficult. For some reason it was easier for me to feel compassion for him as a newborn so I didn\u2019t get frustrated as much when he was a baby and wouldn\u2019t go to sleep or stop crying. I viewed him as a fairly helpless baby so I felt bad that I couldn\u2019t soothe him but didn\u2019t get frustrated much that he wouldn\u2019t calm himself.\n\nI\u2019ve learned a lot from No-Drama Discipline. I just picked up The Happiest Toddler on the Block because I got so much good info from the Happiest Baby on the Block,that\u2019s booked helped us a lot. Damn, this got long! Ha, well I hope that helps you on your journey to be more patient. It\u2019s not easy and I\u2019m still a work in progress.
