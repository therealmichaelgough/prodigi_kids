My husband and I have no problem whatsoever with his interest in the doll, and find it to be a normal healthy interest. With that aside, my dolly is past her prime and I worry about her being destroyed or becoming a choking hazard. So we only have short visits with her, and my son loves his play time with her. To be honest she has a few holes in her stuffing and is kind of creepy looking. So, I would really like to replace the doll with an anatomically accurate baby boy doll for my little man. He really enjoys looking at her ears, feet, hands, and eyes and I think this could be a great developmental tool. I am interested in your thoughts. Would you do the same for your son? Where would be the best place to buy one? We want our son to grow up without feeling he must only do \"boy\" things, but worry family or friends may criticize his having a doll. Thoughts? Experience in this? Thanks in advance Mommies!\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for your insightful, accepting, and positive  responses! I really appreciate the advice, ideas, and perspective. I am truly overwhelmed and very delighted with the overall positive take on this topic. You all seem like fabulous moms! I definitely do plan to get my boy a dolly of his own now, no shame!
