FWIW, I'm nursing my 14.5 month old and things haven't really changed much since about 11 months except that he's more mobile now (learned to walk at 12 months). He only REALLY eats once during the day, after his one nap, but still nurses around every 2 hours at night (sometimes he'll have a rare 4 or 5 hour stretch, other times it's every hour) so that's pretty much been the same since birth. ;) We co-sleep so it isn't so bad, but it's not so great either.\n\nAs far as the benefits go, it's definitely great to calm him down when out and about. I mean, if he gets hurt (he's walking now so falling down/bumping into things is pretty common) I can just pop him on the boob and he's almost instantly calm. We taught him sign language, so when he signs milk during the day it's usually just for comfort, but I like being able to give that to him. He never took a pacificer, doesn't suck his thumb/fingers, and hasn't got a lovey, so I'm it. :)\n\nI'm also getting over a really nasty cold and he never got it, so I'm thinking that's probably from the antibodies. Now that he's going on a lot more playdates and we're actually DOING things, he's around a lot more kids and any extra protection I can give him makes me feel less stressed about it! Also, he sometimes gets a bit overwhelmed at playdates and he asks to nurse a lot more when we're out, and again, it makes me happy that I can help him regulate with his emotions like that with something he finds so comforting. (Obviously there are other ways to calm an upset child, but about 3 seconds on the boob usually fixes everything!)\n\nIf you want to read up more about nursing a toddler though, I highly recommend the book Mothering Your Nursing Toddler. I had to order mine off Amazon because nothing local had it, but it's been a great read. It also has a chapter on nursing through pregnancy and tandem nursing if you're interested.\n\n*Oh, and related to other things you posted in this thread - I'm also an academic, but I just teach part-time. I knew the whole tenure track/teaching/research thing wasn't compatible with wanting to stay home with my kid for the first few years, so compromised with part-time teaching. No security, but I love teaching more than research, so it worked out well. It's too bad there aren't more part-time research gigs though, because that would've also been tempting. There are days though where it feels silly that I spent 11 years in university and have a PhD, and I make very little money teaching one course a semester with zero job stability! Not the way I thought things would turn out when I started grad school. ;) Good luck with all your interviews etc. I realy hope you end up with the job you want, and a family situation that works too!* \n\nAnyhoo, probably more than you were looking for, but I had some time to kill before bed. :)", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1362620150, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": 1362620510, "gilded": 0, "id": "c8r49q3", "link_id": "t3_19lgak", "parent_id": "t1_c8qx8dn", "removal_reason": null, "retrieved_on": 1431506310, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"archived": true, "author": "sammisamantha", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "Just because you aren't getting your  it doesn't mean your can't get pregnant! \nCheck with a fertility specialist or OB about your eggs.

I spend time in the corporate and government contracting worlds...academia is for me.\n\nAs far as nursing, I wonder how this might change for us over time. Right now he doesn't really nurse for comfort except at night. On a plane, when he was 9 months, he refused to nurse while his ears popped, poor babe. At bedtime, instead of nursing down, he wants to look around the room and explore...nursing is just tolerated. I cherish the idea of maintaining a closeness and connection with him through nursing whenever and as log as he wants. I will try to maintain that for him. And for me. But right now he doesn't seem to love it as much as is described in various blogs I see. I will have to go read the toddler nursing book, I think.\n\nThe other night he awoke with strange cries and I nursed him back down and he slept for the rest of the night (yay). I found out in the morning that his diaper smelled of ammonia and his skin was horribly irritated. He woke up in pain and the pain *stayed* but he was thoroughly soothed by nursing. Hmm...bad thing about the pain, but the power of nursing in this example is not lost on me...I shall remind myself of it.\n\nSorry for the meandering.
