Because the rest of us with kids like yours learned a similar hard lesson and stay away from story time!!  ;)  I tried taking my son to an organized story time for the first time around that same age.  I thought it would be a lovely, calm way to get out of the house with him and his newborn brother.  \n\nOh.\nMy.\nGod.\n\nThe story time was held in a local historic home, and some brainiac decided the best room was the one with a glass case of fine china.  Everybody else's kids (ranging from 11 months to 4) sat nicely and listened, while my kid was crawling along the empty bottom shelf of the china display, giggling hysterically at my attempts to grab him while trying to keep my nursing 5-week-old from falling out of the wrap.  Another mother with an older kid took pity on me and helped me coax him out and then moved her chair to block access to the case.  The docent kept trying to get his attention by asking him come up and point out pictures in the book, to no avail.  During the song and dance at the end, he stood in the middle of the room giving everyone a \"WTF is wrong with you people?\" look, until he decided he was done half way through the song and threw a tantrum when I kept him from leaving.\n\nI didn't take him to another story time until just recently, at 33 months.  He can now sit for at least one short book (usually), but does not understand why on earth anyone would stand up and sing and dance at the end, and he still gets really upset if he wants to leave and anyone tries to stop him.  He is just a very active, energetic kid!  When he is doing something physical like playing a game with his friends that involves running or climbing or jumping he has a wonderful long attention span and can follow rules, but sitting still and listening is just not his thing.  We're still trying since we found a story time in a much more active-kid-friendly setting that is lead by certified preschool teachers, but I still don't expect him to sit through the whole thing for quite some time!\n\nIf you want more socialization for both of you, I recommend finding a moms group that meets at local parks instead of a structured/quiet activity.  I have been going to the same one for a year now and both my sons and I have made some really great friends, and at least twice a week he gets to go to a different park and let out all of his wild energy with kids who can keep up with him!", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1360009821, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "c89aogz", "link_id": "t3_17vmgi", "parent_id": "t3_17vmgi", "retrieved_on": 1431182895, "score": 7, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"archived": true, "author": "dropkickpa", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "Give her a chance to understand, I bet she'll surprise you.", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1360010340, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "c89av5i", "link_id": "t3_17vmgi", "parent_id": "t1_c89a3v2", "retrieved_on": 1431182981, "score": 9, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"archived": true, "author": "rubyzlovah", "author_flair_css_class": "lightcoral", "author_flair_text": "1 girl, 4 years old", "body": "Almost evey child is like this in their first times.

But as an adult who was exactly like your daughter is at that age, you have not failed her! And don't be comparing her to her peers too much, especially at that age. Some kids can sit quietly and listen seemingly without having to learn, but some kids don't learn to do that until well older (I myself didn't really get good at it until 9+, and even then I had to doodle constantly to stay focused on the lessons in school).\n\nDon't think of \"her peers\" as the other kids in the story group! As cochineal said, there literally is a natural selection process happening at those kinds of places. Kids that just can't handle it aren't taken back, and the parents of kids who are good in that environment bring them more often. I would never have been able to do (or *enjoy*) a quiet story group as a kid. But I excelled in hands-on learning and was very smart when able to use more of my senses while absorbing information. I went to a couple of science day-camps as a child and was \"top of the class\" in the lessons-disguised-as-games because the learning involved getting up and doing things, and I was quite popular with the other kids, if I may say so. It sounds like your daughter would do great at a Montessori school when she gets older.\n\nIs there a local organization that does kids swimming lessons near you? That's a good physically-oriented social activity that even babies can handle.
