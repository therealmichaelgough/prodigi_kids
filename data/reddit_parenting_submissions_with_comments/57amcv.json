Every second of the day she is responsible for keeping a helpless human alive. In the first 6 weeks, milk supply is still building, and at times baby may legitimately need to nurse every 45 minutes (or even more frequently). It's really hard to fit naps into that schedule. And chronic sleep deprivation makes EVERYTHING seem worse. \n\n&gt;I am supposed to take some time off next week to again help out and I already take care of the all the housework, cook for us, etc.  \n\nHow much housework is there? Why isn't your mom helping? I'll tell you what I tell anyonewho feels like they are drowning in housework: *hire help.* **But for heaven's sake don't use this to pressure your bruised, still-bleeding wife to do more chores.**\n\n&gt;I am at my wits end with the constant complaining and gratification that she needs.  \n\nThere's one clear solution to this. Deal with it. Practice your own coping skills. Be kinder. Practice empathy, and understand that the hormonal tsunami your wife is dealing with right now, along with the chronic sleep deprivation can make her feel irritable, angry, and depressed... and that this can develop into PPD. Which is treatable and temporary. In the meantime, be kinder. \n\n&gt;It is not possible for me to do everything even though I know she has minor discomfort (no more than any other first time mom).\n\nAre you fucking kidding me??? Have you even stopped to consider what pregnancy, childbirth, and breastfeeding can do to your body? Here's a hint: it's not minor. And in case you haven't heard me the other two times I mentioned it: **chronic sleep deprivation is a classic torture technique for a reason.**\n\n&gt; my mom is thinking about leaving for home early as she is so frustrated not being able to take some time with her grandson.\n\nYour mother needs to get her priorities straight. At 3-4 weeks postpartum, grandma's main job is to make life easier for mom and dad, not to spend time with the baby. There will be many years for her to bond with her grandkid(s). While mom is still trying to establish nursing, grandma has to take a step back and do what's actually *helpful.* This is about the baby's *need* for milk and bonding with mom, not about grandma's *want* to enjoy the fun parts about newborns and still be a houseguest who is waited upon. \n\nOn second thought, if your mom is truly acting as petty and selfish as your description sounds, your wife might be relieved by her departure. \n\nTo sum up: it's hard to be a new dad. It's hard to be a new mom. Grandparents need to be actively helpful or get out of the way. You need be your wife's biggest cheerleader and source of reassurance right now. It usually gets better, but your attitude is almost certain to make it far worse.

I had 2nd degree tears and was on pain meds but by the end of the prescription, sitting and standing were still uncomfortable. I went back to work at 8 weeks but it was very, very difficult and I wish I could have waited 4 more weeks.\n\nAlso, is the baby sleeping in y'all's room? I am amazed at how little sleep I get. I can barely function some days. Other days, I just power through work but I literally fall asleep in the middle of dinner most nights. I'm used to operating on less than 6 hours of sleep but it with a baby, I am never really at rest. I can hear him begin to fuss from a mile away. I have bolted up out of bed moments before he woke up because I am that in tune to him. It's constant, even at 16 weeks!\n\nI loved my baby from the get go but I did not really start to like him until 4 weeks of age. He was just so demanding and I was so tired! I mean, I've been carrying him for 9 months. When do I get to rest? Lol....never!\n\nIt was hard on my husband, too. He has done amazingly well but we are able to order in a lot of meals and we aren't super clean. The dishes are done, the laundry is done, the floor and bathrooms are clean but our tables are hella cluttered! We're both kind of okay with that and we come together to clean when we have the energy.\n\nWhen my MIL visits, she goes into Super Nanny Mode. She enjoys cleaning and taking care of house stuff as well as playing with her grandson! It took me some time but I'm finally comfortable letting her do what she wants and the woman wants to clean! \n\nCould you look into hiring infrequent help?
