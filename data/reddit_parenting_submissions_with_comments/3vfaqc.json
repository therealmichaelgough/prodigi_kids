Now, I will admit that it does have a multitude of capabilities, however, it is lacking. I know from experience that it just isn't enough. The tiny screen that somehow constantly has a glare, no matter the level of light, WILL give me a headache. The games I have on it have reached the level of maximum saturation and I just can't quite find the entertainment any longer. When I'm not [working] there, I won't have the benefit of a set schedule. \u2026when it's time to relax, the playstation will fill that solidly and keep me from getting restless.\n &gt;Money- Having the playstation (hooked up to the TV in my room that will be larger than this tiny laptop screen) will be able to deliver a vast amount of entertainment, keeping me from going out to the shitty, overpriced pool halls or movie theaters that proliferate any area surrounding [here].\n &gt;It won't be as hard back here as you think- I understand your biggest holdup on my taking the playstation isn't your doubt of the benefit to me, but instead, you're afraid of how difficult it might be here without it. Once you have your new laptop from [your job], we will suddenly have a spare computer on our hands. We can hook up either one of our laptops to the tv (via hdmi or usb) and keep the same amount of entertainment level the family has now. I'm the only one who uses the playstation for anything other than movies (both laptops have dvd drives) or netflix/amazon (both can be streamed through the laptop). We can set up a bookmark folder that would have everything your mom might need, ie netflix, amazon prime, youtube.\nIn conclusion, while it may take a bit of adjustment, the evidence shows that the benefit to my sanity vastly overshadows the minor and temporary inconvenience that may be caused by my taking the playstation to [work]. \n\n&gt;Love, forever and always,\n\n&gt;Your faithful husband,\n\n&gt;PS You're beautiful and thank you for agreeing with me\n\n*edited out personal identifying info*", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Husband told me he was taking PlayStation on 3-month work trip.
