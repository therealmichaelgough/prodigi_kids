Mine will never be the same after three babies. The muscles are back in shape again, mostly (although I find it hard to \"access\" the deep muscles in my lower abdomen, which makes belly dancing harder because I need them to move dammit!). Yours will too, with enough time and exercise - be patient and don't expect it to snap back quickly. It's a long process. You'll get there again.  : )\n\nBut the skin? Hells no. My belly skin will always be stretched out and a little poochy. I hated it at first and then decided that was a waste of my time and energy. It looks like that because I was lucky enough to give birth to two living children and one sleeping angel. They will always be an indelible part of me. I have decided that I am now a \"luxury model\" with a snakeskin insert panel on my stomach.  ;)   I have a fashionable stomach - it has a nice mix of textures, and that always gives an outfit some panache, right? My stomach has panache. lol \n\nIn all seriousness though, what helped me learn to accept it was taking up belly dancing. I spent hours in classes staring at my naked stomach in a mirror, in a room full of other women whose bodies were all unique, and I realized that my stomach could do more cool shit even though it was carrying around a bit of extra pudge, some faded stretch marks, and some loose skin. It also helped the muscles come alive again, and it's fun as hell! After a while I decided that I was going to pierce my belly button as a way to adorn my stomach. It sounds cheesy but I kinda felt like it deserved something pretty after all I'd put it through, having two kids, several miscarriages, and a stillbirth in a five-year period. That helped too - a nice sparkly blue stone shining back at me from the mirror in dance class cheered me up. It's been five more years. My kids are 11 and 9. My body has bounced back almost completely; I still have faded stretch marks, and my c-section scar is still visible, and I'm still carrying around the last 10 lbs of baby weight (but I don't want to lose it because I need it; I was underweight before having kids and I'm paranoid about winding up there again, cuz it sucks!). Nobody told me how long it would take, or how much work it would end up being...mostly you just hear that it's never going to happen so just give up, interspersed with bitchy \"I'm a fitness model and I have seventeen kids, what's your excuse??\" blog posts. Not helpful. You can get back in shape. You just have to be patient with yourself and put in long hours of effort. It can be one of your favourite body parts again.  :)  I'm quite happy with mine now - I no longer need to encourage myself to embrace it. I finally have some visible abs again. But it took years for me to get here. It would have taken less time if I'd been a more disciplined person, probably, but I'm not so here we are. \n\nAnyway, I think a lot of our struggle comes from the idea that anything other than airbrushed fake perfection is \"a flaw\". Guess what though, we are the lucky ones who get to build another human being with our bodies...that's so fucking *boss*. Those stretch marks aren't a flaw. They're evidence that our bodies did something incredible and endured it and healed themselves afterwards. The sagging skin isn't a flaw - it's supposed to do that! That's what skin does when it stretches out to accommodate new life. The extra weight isn't a flaw - that's what bodies do when we're pregnant. We need the extra weight to stay healthy. It's a good thing. The weak muscles aren't a flaw - they are the normal result of your abdominal wall wrapping around a burgeoning uterus. None of these things we hate about ourselves are flaws...they're evidence that our bodies did something awesome that only women's bodies get to do. Flaws? Hell no. Marks of badassery. Evidence of deep love and sacrifice. Nothing flawed about that. Perfection is overrated. All the images of \"perfect bodies\" are inaccurate - even the most beautiful bodies still have moles and wrinkles and bad smells and morning breath and unwanted hair that has to be removed. We're all in the same boat.
