In highschool &amp; university, sometimes I'd be nicknamed *Little*-FerretPantaloons (sigh, I'm short). In elementary school I don't really remember - though likely there was 1 other FerretPantaloons in some of my classes.\n\nIf you picked a top 5 or top 10 name, how many same-named kids are you running into? Does it bother your child at all? \n\nEdit: It's neat to hear all your stories! Quite a spectrum. Good points to have backup nicknames or middle names...\n\n**I'd like to know more about your kids' names recently - are common names still an issue?** Not too many people mention their kids below, but mention their own - is it 'cause most people skip common names now?\nThanks!", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Did you pick a popular baby name (top 5? top 10?) &amp; how did it go?", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/17dd06/did_you_pick_a_popular_baby_name_top_5_top_10_how/", "user_reports": []}, "comments": [{"archived": true, "author": "okdani", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "The names I love and have loved for a while were Liam and Aiden.
