Couldn\u2019t get her to open her eyes or talk to anyone. She would flinch away if you punched or tickled her, would stand, grab for stuff, etc. well I get there and take her to the ER. A few minutes after we get to the ER she opens her eyes starts talking, is completely fine. Neuro check was fine so they didn\u2019t do a scan. Don\u2019t think anything medical is going on. The doctor seems to think either A) she fell asleep, was embarrassed so she acted like she was still sleeping, got super embarrassed and didn\u2019t know how to get out of said situation when people started to get worried. Or B ) she wanted to get out of school and is pretty smart for a 7 year old. I asked her if anything is bothering her at school or if anyone is being mean or anything and asked her if anything is bothering her at home and she says no. \nShe has a tic where she blinks frequently and her teacher called me yesterday and said it has been worse at school the last week or 2. So I took her to her regular doctor today. Her doctor is not concerned and also thinks she was just faking it. She also asked all kinds of questions about school as well as doing a neuro exam and said that all seems fine. Suggested that maybe I try a low dose of melatonin and see if that improves her tic at all suggesting maybe she\u2019s just tired. \nI am completely satisfied by these answers however I had missed the original school call (immediately called back) but the next person on the list to call was my mom so by the time I got to the school she was also there (in complete hysterics, because she makes everything crazy) and she\u2019s convinced that something is medically going on. \nSo I guess I\u2019m just asking if anyone has had any similar situations? \nShe\u2019s acted completely fine since the incident by the way, no concerning behaviors at all.
