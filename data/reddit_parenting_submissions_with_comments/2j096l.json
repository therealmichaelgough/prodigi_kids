He is overweight.  He has a family history.  His breathing patterns at night are consistent with those of obstructive sleep apnea.  Thank you Reddit for your collective knowledge! \n\nI went out to ask him about the apnea, and he had passed out on the couch with a full, cold glass of beer next to him, glasses on, and remote in hand.  I had to physically shake him to rouse him.  We both think this is the possible problem and he's going to pursue weight loss as a course of action until we can schedule a sleep study. \n\nPS-- the people who thought I was super-overreacting by being desperate for a solution to this problem can take a chill pill themselves.  I'm by no means a perfectionist, nor am I uptight about... anything.  My kid eats, sleeps, and gets held or played with whatever feels right for all of us at the time.  I don't expect perfection out of my husband, either, which is why I forgave (but did not forget!) the first time this happened.  Of course I trust him.  I prefaced the whole post with \"wonderful relationship.\"  I believe everything he says.  We just had a very real problem that needed a solution, not more judginess.  \n\nMy husband and I have a wonderful relationship.  We have a happy, healthy 5 1/2 month old son.\n\nAt the beginning of July, when our son was ~2.5 months old, I had to stay at work later than my usual 10PM as the next shift was running extremely late.  I called at 9:30 to let my husband know that he should defrost some more milk-- no answer.  I sent him a Google Hangout message.  No answer.  I sent him a Steam message through my phone, thinking maybe he was playing a video game.  No answer.  I figured he had left his cell phone next to his computer, as he sometimes did, and was in another room with baby.  I tried to call again three times-- thinking certainly he would be getting worried-- but to no avail.  I got home around 11:30 to find a raccoon on my front doorstep.  Fuck if I was going to mess with him!  Went around to the porch to come in the side door.  As soon as I stepped into the porch, I knew something was wrong.  The light was on in the office, and I could hear my son SCREAMING.  That sort of **I am in pain** scream.  I go to open the door to get him-- and the chain is on the door so I can't open it. I yell for my husband, no good (obviously.)  Scream his name.  No good. I am less than 2 feet from my baby, who was in his rocker in his PJ's, with a snuggly blanket around his legs and a pacifier next to his head, but I can't get to him.  I try unsuccessfully to unlock the chain with my hand.  Try to call my husband again.  See/hear his phone right in front of me on the desk.  After what felt like an eternity but was probably 2 or 3 minutes, I grabbed an axe from the porch and lit out after the racoon so I could get in the front door.\n\nI'm thinking the worst.  My husband has had a seizure.  Maybe he's dead.  Maybe he completely lost it and left the house.  Maybe he's drunk off his ass and passed out.  Someone's broken in and tied him up and stolen all of our stuff.  I didn't know what to think, but Momma Bear had kicked in at that point, so I'm sure I was a sight to behold-- running and yelling down my sidewalk at midnight, and waving an old rusty axe.  The racoon didn't move until I got about 5 feet away.  Luckily he took off when I got close.  \n\nI bust in the house, and the bedroom is about 10 feet from the door.  My husband is laying on the bed.  I scream his name from the doorway and run to his side.  He wakes up.  He was **sound the fuck asleep.** Curled up in bed, on top of the covers, in his gym shorts and undershirt.  I yelled \"WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU, OUR SON IS SCREAMING.\"  I came within an inch of throwing the rusty old axe at him.  He wakes up in a daze, wondering what I'm so worked up about.  He finally (after ~5 seconds) gets the message that our son is screaming at the other end of the house.  He goes to get him, still in a daze.  I'm thinking at this point that surely he's drunk.  Why else would he leave our son unattended like that?  Realize my mistake and go take the baby from him as soon as he's picked him up.  I'm still flipping out.  Realize the baby is still freaking out, and I'm not helping that situation, so I calm down some.  Feed the baby and get him to sleep safely in his crib with the monitor on.  Talk to husband, who fell back asleep in the meantime.  He insists he hadn't had anything to drink, and was just very tired, and wanted to rest his back.  And fell asleep.  He told me (and I believe him) that he knew I would be home any minute and the baby was asleep when he left him, and it hadn't been that long-- but that he'd just fallen asleep accidentally.  My issue wasn't that he had fallen asleep while in charge of our son, but that if something had happened (I was stuck at work all night, I was in a car accident, something had happened to my parents and I had to go to the hospital with them, etc) he never would have answered the phone (which had been left in the office, as I thought) or woken up and our son would have been left out there for 9+ hours by himself, crying uncontrollably until he passed out.  \n\nHe apologized and blamed the long work day, and taking care of a baby for 4 hours after that.  He blamed his cell phone for not ringing.  I get on him about making excuses, and he says \"I feel bad enough about this already, alright?  I get it.\" \n\nI'm not sure what happened after that.  The adrenaline faded.  I do remember telling my husband, \"This will never happen again.\"\n\n------\n\nFast forward to tonight.  I worked all day and brought home another infant who belongs to some friends of mine who wanted to attend an outdoor festival.   We have a great time with my 12-year-old brother and the two babies.  Little girl's mom and my mom come to pick up their respective kids.  Husband's had a fair amount of video game time that evening, so I request that I can eat a snack and play some video games.  He's tired.  Fair enough!  Offers to take the baby into the bedroom and watch youtube together so I can play.  Sounds like an awesome idea.  Brings baby out after a little while so I can feed him his before-bedtime solid food.  Take a clean, happy, full baby back into my husband, who's still watching Youtube in the bedroom.  Hand him over and get back to my video game.  About half an hour later, I see a funny Reddit post and send it to my husband's phone.  Don't hear back in ~30 seconds, so I go back to tell him about it.  I get about halfway there before I hear that sound again-- the **I AM IN PAIN AND ANGUISH** scream that makes a mother's heart stop.  Say, \"Oh my god\" and run to his room.  He's face down (well, I say face down-- he can hold his head up great now so he wasn't wallowing in it) in a puddle of drool/spitup, up against the rail, red-faced from crying so hard.  Pick up baby, calm him down, go in to bedroom to ask husband wtf-- and he's there on the bed asleep with the baby monitor on the bed next to him.  Apologizes for not hearing the baby.  Baby is soaked, so go to change him and only get halfway through before going back into the bedroom to tell my husband that he needs to get up and change the sheet and blanket in the crib.  He must have been really out of it because he asked my \"why\" after I'd just told him that our son was screaming in a pool of drool.  This whole time my son is just clinging to me, quiet as a mouse.  It was almost like he was in shock-- but once I sat down with him to feed him, he was all smiles and cuddles.  He went right to sleep.  I rocked him for about half an hour after he fell asleep, thinking how precious he is, and marveling at how his loving, doting Daddy could possibly abandon him like that AGAIN.  This time my husband was much less apologetic and was in and out of sleep the whole time I tried to talk to him about it.  I gave up but was too worked up to try to go to sleep.\n\nI debated calling my mother, but she'd never forgive him.  I thought about calling a friend, but it was late and all of our friends are mutual friends-- and I feel like it would be a huge breach of trust to talk about this very sensitive, personal problem with a friend of his.  So, I turn to you, Reddit.  I'm afraid to leave him at home with my husband at night.  I work 3 nights a week though-- and we can't go without that income.  My husband doesn't think that his is a very big deal, but to me it's a HUGE deal.  These are situations that ended in pretty much the best possible way, with Momma swooping in to rescue screaming baby while Daddy snoozes, and everyone is OK in the end.  To me, this is a much bigger deal with potentially deadly consequences. \n\nPlease help.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I'm afraid to leave my husband alone with my son.

This guy is your life partner, and he\u2019s learning just like you are\u2026 I think you need to take off the \u2018judge and jury\u2019 attitude and step back a bit.  You are not better at this than your husband, and believing that you are will eventually be toxic to your relationship.  He\u2019s learning too.  And I\u2019m sure you have BOTH made mistakes.  It would be good for your husband to make sure he is reachable \u2013 so he does need to make sure he has a phone nearby.  But other than that, this is no big deal.\n\nBefore I go on \u2013 fellow mom of 2 here - 3 yr old and 5 yr old.  I have been there\u2026 and it will be ok, the baby will be ok, and you guys will figure it out.. but I think you need to reset some expectations and check some ideas at the door.  Here\u2019s what I thought while reading your rant:\n\n1)\t\u201cless perfection, more \u2018good enough\u2019 or \u2018better next time\u2019 - It's easy as a new mother to be a perfectionist and want everything to go exactly a certain way.  It doesn't last.  I used to measure milk bottles to the exact ounce and refuse to give the baby more because that wasn't what the books said.  Why the heck not? the baby was hungry!!! but in my head I was controlling it and doing it 'right'.  That was crazy.  babies are resilient and pretty easy.  let them eat until they are full.  if they don't ask to eat, it's ok if the bottle is 30 mins late.  It's ok if daddy forgets it... the baby is not going to starve in a few hours time.  each minute or hour is a lot less important than what happens over the course of the week.\n\n2)\t\u201cdon\u2019t give the baby feelings he is too small to have\u201d babies really are that simple - do not read more into their emotions than are there.  they are eating pooping crying machines.  he is not clinging to you in fear, he's not in shock... he also probably didn't care that much he had drool all over him.  he was just hungry, and he was using the only communication tool he has. \n\n3)\t\u201cYou are not better at this than your husband\u201d \u2013 and believing that you are will eventually be toxic to your relationship. You both need to learn how to be parents.  You may get more practice sooner \u2013 but he needs practice too and he can and will get to be as good at it as you.  You will regret it if you create a situation where you are the all-knowing expert on the baby and he can\u2019t do anything right.  After a while that will start to feel shitty for him and he\u2019ll stop trying \u2013 and I don\u2019t think you want that.  The best thing you can do is step back and give him space to figure it out.  And if he makes a mistake, let him say sorry and move on.  He feels bad and panicked about it too, but he doesn\u2019t need scolding from you.  He\u2019s already beating himself up about it.\n\n4)\tYour husband is human.  And a male human.  And they really do sleep through babies crying.  \u2018Abandon\u2019 is a strong word to use about a guy who is probably tired, and is wired differently than you.  As per point #3. \u2013 use liberal doses of forgiveness, and acknowledge that you are both learning.  One day you are going to make a mistake, and you\u2019ll need that same support from him! As a mom you will hear crying that your husband honestly will not hear.  5 years in, my husband still thinks I have super powers b/c I\u2019m already walking to the kids bedroom before he hears the first cry.  Dad\u2019s are wired for different things. Those differences are important and you need them.  Later in life Dad will be the one who lets your child experience thrilling new things, throw him high in the air.  He will also be the one to pull junior away from a speeding car or catching him falling off a bike faster than you do.  Dads have a super high tuned danger \u2018alarm\u2019\u2026   have a look at this article: [Why Women Wake When a Baby Cries](http://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/08/why-mom-wakes-up-when-baby-cries/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0).  basically *\u201cthese differing sensitivities may represent evolutionary differences that make that make women sensitive to sounds associated with a potential threat to their children while men are more finely tuned to disturbances posing a possible threat to the whole family\u201d*\n\n5)\t\u201cFind the trust for your husband\u201d  Life is long and you have many, many big and small decisions to make for your child.  The only way it works is if you get back to trusting him. Especially as your son gets older.  He needs to see that you both respect each other.\n\n6)\t\u201cyou don\u2019t want to be in charge of all decisions ever\u201d \u2013 18 years is a long time to have to decide everything. Life is much better if Dad feels good about being able to decide what goes in the lunch, or if he does the bath, or will do bedtime. but he wont\u2019 do ANY of that, or even try, if you are going to be hovering, disagreeing or criticizing. \n\n", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1413106351, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "cl7806l", "link_id": "t3_2j096l", "parent_id": "t3_2j096l", "retrieved_on": 1426567868, "score": 78, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"archived": false, "author": "thedifficultpart", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "What about setting up s pack n play in your bedroom so baby can sleep there for when hubby feels he has to nap?

Also it was snowing, we lived in NH and it was the 80s, so no cell phones. She walked to a pay phone and called my dad several times, no answer.
