A woman commented on how she didn't breastfeed and hated the guilt tripping and how much people pushed it on her. Someone replied with, \"just curious, but why did you choose to not breastfeed?\"\n\n**That's exactly our point.** I had to hold myself back from exploding into the conversation. Are you their pediatrician? No? Then it's none of your business. I don't care if you're \"curious\": you don't need to know. Do you walk up to a woman and ask, \"excuse me, just curious, but have you had breast augmentation surgery recently? Why did you have that done?\" It's a personal decision that really doesn't affect you. \n\nWhat got me even worse was that the OP replied that she tried and it didn't take: bad latch, low supply, etc., etc. Pretty much the same issue I had. But then to other person replied, \"oh ok, well at least you tried it.\"\n\nNo. She shouldn't be required to try it if she doesn't want to. It's her body. And I'm saying this as a woman who never even *considered* formula. It wasn't on the table for me at all. But then my son was born, and within 24 hours my nipples were bleeding (not cracked: outright oozing blood continuously) and plum purple. I was screaming in pain at the latch and couldn't stand to have him on me at all. But you know what? I shouldn't *have* to tell people that. I shouldn't have to give all the details of why I don't breastfeed to every person who decides it's their business to ask me why. Because it's my body, and it's my child. Our pediatrician didn't even flinch over the decision once we made it. Sure, I probably could have strapped the baby to my chest and screamed my way through it the entire time. I was certainly *capable* of breastfeeding. But I decided, after trying it, it just wasn't for us. And that's after *trying* it.\n\nMaybe I'm wrong, but if a woman says, \"I know I don't want to do it and won't like it, so I'm not going to\", *forcing* her to do it and shaming her over it isn't going to change the facts that, 1. you're telling her what to do with her body, 2. the difference is marginal, and 3. even if you *did* get her to do it, she'd still probably hate it. How is forcing a woman to breastfeed that really, really doesn't want to, improving the quality of life for her family?

In fact, it's only about 1 in 1000 women.  It's sad that so many women believe they cannot breastfeed because their milk is slow to come in, or their production is low.  There needs to be more awareness about breastfeeding and IGT to address breastfeeding problems and offer support for those women learning they cannot breastfeed due to IGT.  \n\nHere are some rhetorical questions:  \n\nDid you know having an epidural or c-section slows your milk coming in by as much as 48 hours?  How about receiving magnesium for treatment of PIH (pregnancy induced hypertension)?  Did you know it's harder for male children to successfully breastfeed?  And what about mothers who have stressful deliveries or pre-gestational maternal illnesses like diabetes?  All of these things can cause your milk to come in late or your supply to suffer, but it certainly **DOES NOT** mean you cannot breastfeed.\n\nWhile I feel bad for mothers who are led astray by faulty information, it also sort of offends me when so many women so nonchalantly say, \"Oh, I just *couldn't* breastfeed.\"  While I respect everyone's choice as to how to feed their child, please don't say you can't breastfeed because it undermines those of us who truly struggle with a physical condition that takes away any chance of being able to nourish our children with our own breast milk.  And let me tell you, learning that you cannot - and will never be able to - breastfeed is more than devastating.  It's something many women actually grieve over for *years*.

I took 6 weeks off of work when I had my daughter.  That's six weeks that I could have breastfed, but I didn't because it's only six weeks and then I was back to work.  I run a family practice office.  I am constantly on the phone, working with patients, receiving, checking out, I am the billing department, the insurance specialist, the medical records department.  I answer all phone calls  and faxes and emails that come in.  I don't have time to pump.  Breastfeeding after that 6 weeks would be impossible, so I decided that I would skip the potential latching, supply, weening problems and just enjoy spending time with my baby before I went back to work. \n\nThe second reason is no family support.  I was bottle fed as were all of my siblings.  My sisters had children before I did, and their children were all bottle fed.  It's not like my family discouraged breastfeeding, they wouldn't have tried to convert me if I had breastfed.

Anyway, you probably aren't 1 in 1000.  \n\nHow many children do you have?  If you haven't been diagnosed with IGT then it's very likely you'll be able to breastfeed other children.  Things happen that can cause your milk to never come in properly, but again, it still doesn't mean you can't breastfeed.  Usually there are underlying causes for severe IMS (thyroid problems, hormone imbalances, type of delivery, epidural, etc.) that can be corrected with time and (often) lots of dedication; however, many women feel it's easier to just go with formula than to struggle through everything.  I don't blame them either.  Dealing with severe IMS is emotionally draining.\n\nI know most women don't like what I'm saying, but it's true.  The whole thing is basically a matter of semantics, but one that has the very real consequence of undermining women who do suffer from IGT.  The difference is saying \"I wasn't able\" vs. \"I can't.\"  I understand ~15% of women experience major breastfeeding troubles - including severe IMS, latch issues, mastitis, etc. - but it absolutely is NOT the same as being physically unable to breastfeed.

There are lots of valid reasons to not breastfeed, or to stop. I had kind of the perfect storm of breastfeeding problems: baby with severe tongue and lip tie, jaundiced baby, my own very large breasts, PCOS/hypothyroid, and improper latch even after surgery. The kid could not even latch onto a bottle. I fed her with a syringe until her surgery. By the time I was able to get my daughter's surgery done, I was already 9 days postpartum, which may not seem like much but when you're trying to establish supply it can really mess things up.\n\nWas I physically able to produce milk? Yes. But my daughter physically could not latch, and I was lucky to get one ounce of milk, total, in a pumping session. I went to an LC twice. I tried two different types of nipple shields. I was eating all the food, taking all the supplements, drinking swimming pools of water, and nothing worked. I gave up. I cried and cried and cried. When people tell me I just didn't try hard enough, or that I just needed to eat more dates (true story), I become pretty enraged inside. They weren't there with me while I was pumping every 2 hours to get barely an ounce of breastmilk that I then had to feed my newborn, sickly, yellow daughter, drop-by-drop, with a syringe.\n\nAlso, on a different note, I often see people saying they are irritated when women feel breastfeeding is \"icky.\" I actually have never come across someone with this attitude. I wonder if those who feel that way before/while being pregnant still feel that way afterwards?
