I am doubly interested in the opinions of women who are also mothers, or interested in being mothers, especially any mothers that may have gone through something similar with their young boys. Well...I don't want to get too graphic unless there is some interest shown, and people feel the details are necessary for more context. But basically, I had a very, very uncomfortable relationship with testicle checks as a young boy. I felt extremely private, I was very shy, and on top of that my testicles are extremely sensitive (but there is nothing explicitly wrong with them apparently, except they have an a slightly higher concentration of nerves than your average male). Any time a doctor would bring it up, or my mother, I would bolt out of the doctor's office and literally run a mile away, or just refuse to go to the doctor altogether. For the most part my mother was understanding, but not in a very \"kind\" way. I would be harshly punished and yelled at usually, but at least she would end up signing me out of the exams. Well, until one day she decided that it was time to be firm I guess. She actually went through the trouble of hiring someone to help her escort me to the doctor's office and keep me there. And...well, I had to have my first testicle check while being held down for it. After this, I guess my mom was satisfied that I at least had relatively normal equipment, and didn't really want to subject me to anymore of it, and it didn't come up too much, a few times she would ask if I was willing to have another one, but I was too freaked out to even consider it. But a few years later she felt enough time had gone by, I was older, etc... and decided to take a firm stance again. Both of these were some of the worst days of my life... the experiences were so horrible I have never been able to fully comprehend them, or how a mother could stand there and watch her son go through something like that. I really want to know if other mother's have had to do anything like this? Is it relatively common, or is this just an insane case of misfortune? =/ Articles/blogs like this one make me think it might be somewhat common: http://open.salon.com/content.php?cid=43950 I would really like to know about mother's perspectives on it, and whether you would have done essentially the same thing as my mother or not? Was it something essential, or not? I guess I am just searching for some perspective, opinions from the other side of the equation...it's taken a long time to even get the point of talking about it anonymously on the internet hah. (For age references, I was about 7 the first time, and about 12 the second time). I really appreciate anyone daring to offer their opinion up. It's an awkward subject, but a very real one to me.

That parenting habit tends to cause real problems not only for the parent themselves, but for the child as well, as you experienced when she later refused to give in.\n\nConsistency is one of the biggest rules of parenting, and by failing to uphold it, you were unable to prepare yourself mentally for the exam you'd be required to sit through, which probably led to the trauma that you've carried with you all of these years.\n\nObviously, there's not much your mother can do about these instances now but apologize for not being able to help you with your feelings and fears associated with the testicle checks.  BUT, your negative experiences could prove to help you be a better parent if you choose to have children in your lifetime.\n\nKids may be young, but they're not stupid.  Often, sitting them down and talking with them about things like their body, upcoming doctor visits, even daily experiences can help them develop the resources to understand why something like a testicle check may be necessary.  It doesn't mean that they won't be nervous, embarrassed, or afraid, but it could help them come to terms with their discomfort by understanding their body and what will happen through their discussions with you.  \n\nYou can't lie to kids about procedures and expect them to willingly go to every doctor visit.  Just like you can't cave all but one time and then expect them to trust what you say, or respect your authority as a parent.  The unexpected turn of events often leaves children feeling betrayed and vulnerable.\n\nIf you were to ask me directly, I'd say that your mother was unintentionally responsible for the severely negative experience you had with testicle checks as a child.

Most children, mine included, move on rather quickly for any ordeal and I am there the whole time. \n\nI am sure your mom did what she thought was best for you to be healthy. This procedures are fairly common and preformed for a reason. Is there a reason why this still bothers you? Have you spoken to a doctor or maybe a therapist?

My first exam occurred when I was 8 because I had been raped. So I can say I was \"harassed\" by a doctor in an age near yours. A metal  speculum was inserted into my vagina and my tiny painful bleeding vagina was forced to open wide enough that the doctor could see in and use various tools. I was scraped with several different swabs inside of my vagina it was very painful and confusing at such a young age. Having your cervix poked with a stick is not pleasant in the slightest.  My mother cried. I did not resist the procedure (I did complain of the pain) but If i had resisted my mother would have forced me to go through with it anyway because it was critical information to know. She would have felt bad, but it was necessary.  She would have been HYSTERICAL because she was already at the breaking point due to such a high trauma situation, and she STILL would have held me down if needed because it was a necessary evil. At the time I was confused. In retrospect, i completely understand why it needed to be done, and proud that my mother was there and willing to do what was necessary, not just scrub my skin off with a nail brush like my aunt and pretend nothing was wrong. EVERY other person on here has said that the testicular exam is a necessary evil. I'm sorry you feel that your testicles are particularly sensitive (most men i know will claim theirs is more sensitive then other men's. Yours might be, i obviously do not know you, but all men have sensitive testicles.  I do not know a single man who enjoys the exam, but it is tolerated for health) I am sorry that you were traumatized by this event.  Your mother probably should not have allowed you to bypass this exam so often. The thing is, she is your mom, and genuinely tried to do her best. Being a parent means they are responsible for you and your health. If something horrid had occurred with your testicular development she would have felt horrid for not forcing you to have exams done. Regarding your previous mention of thinking you were able to make health decisions for yourself at 15. Probably not. Opinions on your health sure, but still a child, still under your mother's guidance. Still young enough to think that it was unnecessary and could be skipped on. The decision was still her's to make. It seems that you have a negative view on your own body and sexuality due to being raised that way.  THAT is an issue I would try to seek therapy for. That seems to be the root of your problem with the exams in the first place. Try not to be angry or resentful to your mother, she tried her best.  You seem to be frustrated with the lack of posts here \"supporting\" your trauma/feelings of the topic.  I'm sorry if that makes you feel invalidated at all, I'm sure that is no ones intention. The fact that you are upset by all of this is understandable. I believe the general consensus here though is that yes, the exams are necessary to ensure proper development. Also that your strong reaction to this is likely something you should continue to seek help for.  From your posts I infer that you are typically skeptical of things that your therapists have suggested. Whereas not all of them are great, they have gone to school to study how your brain works. Make sure to give genuine effort into the things they ask/recommend/say. I wasted several years of therapy by brushing it off as \"they just dont get it.\"  Once i finally tried following their suggestions, even rolling my eyes and saying it was stupid, things started to get better.

Some people DO feel very invaded during a health check. The point is to try and find the root of why a seemingly simple exam to the majority of people is so hard for you. \n\nAs to whether it would have been better on you emotionally if mother had enforced all the exams, maybe.  Many phobias/fears are helped but repeat exposure to what is so frightening, and then realizing that whereas it was uncomfortable, it was not the end of the world. \n\nAs for how often one should have testicular exams....I really don't know. It is not my area of knowledge. I am willing to bet a google search or two could answer many of your questions as to why it is necessary or how frequently is should be performed.  I do know that while you are young and developing (and lets be honest, you are likely to develop a bit more still) many people DO NOT know what is normal, and what is truly unusual enough to need medical intervention. Heck, even older adults frequently do not know that something about them is medically incorrect and assume it is \"just how they are.\"  Our society puts soo much pressure on keeping such matters private, that many will choose not to speak up.  Especially a pubescent teen (of either gender) that is trying to understand what is going on with their bodies hormonally, let alone knowing what is normal or not.  My best friend growing up never received a talk from her mother regarding her period.  When I started mine I already knew exactly what it was and how to handle it. My best friend thought she was dying, and because her private parts were not to be discussed, tried to hide it from everyone and cope with the thought that something was wrong and she might be dying, but no one could know.  She broke down crying to me saying she couldn't tell anyone but she knew she was going to die and wanted me to tell her parents that she loved them. One visit to the school therapist later, I am lending her feminine hygiene products and trying to explain more thoroughly what was ACTUALLY happening. Not being aware of your body makes things happening to your body very very scary.  \n\nI would have made you have the sports physical check. I also would have spoken to the school officials about yours needing to be performed privately.  I would have asked if you were more comfortable having it done privately at school or taken to the dr for a physical exam. But it still would have been done.  Most schools will not allow this exam to be waived. \n\nI understand that you do not want to continue this torture of testicular exams, and as an adult, you cannot be forced to.  On one hand it IS something that you should have done. Maybe having more control of the situation will help. Discussing this with a doctor without your mother present is probably going to empower you a bit. If you simply cannot have a doctor get involved yet, I honestly recommend learning more about your reproductive health (there are a million things you could reference) and trying to become more comfortable with your own \"bits and pieces.\"  Touch them yourself. Examine yourself with regularity.  People can have whatever viewpoint on sexuality and masturbation they want, but you should never be afraid/ uncomfortable to touch your own body. I don't know if you are uncomfortable, but it does seem likely with your other...experiences.  The only one who can control your health and sexual well being is you, and everyone should have a firm grasp on themselves.
