I didn't get family portraits.  I didn't even get maternity photos.\n\nI just never thought about it. \n\nWell, turns out this is just HORRIBLE and I've missed SO much by not calling my nearest baby photographer ASAP, even though I take pictures and post them up every day and have been doing so since she was born.  But no... Those photos won't do.  You HAVE to get professional ones! (All according to friends and family and other moms, apparently).\n\nSo, for my little girl's 6 month \"birthday\", I decided to call around.  I wanted something special.  Something fantasy-based because I'm a nerd who's obsessed with D&amp;D and Renn Fest.  I found the PERFECT lady.  Offering \"fairy\" photos.  I call her, talk to her, she offers me some samples.  Cute, but really they were just regular photos with some sparkley bits put in photoshop.  Whatever... I'm supposed to get professional pics so, dammit... I'm doing it.\n\nUntil she told me the price.\n\nFor her \"mini session\" (15 minutes of shooting time and 5 final photos), she wanted $450.  Uh... Excuse me?  I get it, you have to pay the bills, you have to pay for all that gear.  Being a photographer is expensive... But... Just... What?\n\nI couldn't do it.  I called many others in the area and the rates were all around the same price.  WHAT THE HECK?!  When did this get so expensive?  My 12 year old's 1 year photoshoot lasted all day and cost me around $200 and ended up beautiful.  But $450 for 15 minutes?!  I want to ask is this normal, but, you guys... I called 14. Different. Photographers.  It was all the same price. Omg.\n\nEither way, in the end... I took my little girl to a park, snapped some pictures with my phone and sat down and watched 9 billion YouTube videos about photo editing and did it all myself.  I'll put all the money I saved in her savings account and maybe keep $5 for myself for a box of wine.\n\n\nI'm not 100% on the child tax... But here's the finished product: \nhttps://imgur.com/3KBHf8a\n\nI feel like I can send these to people confidently and not have them harp me, anymore, about getting a professional. \n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "When the hell did baby photos get SO expensive?!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/71zq9a/when_the_hell_did_baby_photos_get_so_expensive/"}, "comments": [{"approved_at_utc": null, "author": "beemitch", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "body": "Wow!

First, many people are getting hung up on the 15 minutes thing. There is ALOT more time and energy going into the shoot than just 15 minutes. Travel time to and from the location, equipment setup and take down, and editing the photos easily would take 1-4hrs extra. When I photograph my 2 year old, I will typically take 200-400 photos in 15 minutes. Sounds like a lot but you really have to spray in order to catch a lucky smile when 90% of the time is spent looking the other way, running around, and crying. Culling trough these photos to find the best ones takes time, whittling it down to the top 20 and then editing each one individually for 2-5 minutes each takes time, prepping the final 5 for print and delivery takes 1-2 minutes per photo. Then there is the cost and time of doing business as well: equipment maintenance, software, online advertising, social media, website. Lastly, and the thing that anyone from /r/photography would want you to know is that there is intrinsic value in art that makes it worth money all on its own. Photographers spend an incredible amount of time honing their craft and gaining the skills and knowledge to do what they do before they ever start shooting for clients just like any artist.

My kid is almost 4 and I've never had professional pics taken of him, no fucks given. We don't really have the money plus we don't see the need to.  I take candid pictures and videos of him all the time with my phone, so it's not like he's not being documented.
