We definitely would have had to switch to formula since I wouldn't have been able to keep up and that would be an extra cost.  We went down to one vehicle, my SO took on extra on call time each month, and we don't eat out as much. I also started back to school for my Master's with a local university online.

I plan on staying with my job until the baby comes, once we start trying lol,but am unsure what to do after that. I don't want to be rude and please do not feel like you need to answer me but how much does your husband make? My mother is a SAHM and my father works its always worked out for them. However, I am unsure my husband gets paid enough for me to stay home and I'd like to know what the average would be on that.\n\nLadies, you're all allowed some input on about how much you'd think that would cost :)", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1358995106, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "c82i26c", "link_id": "t3_174nlb", "parent_id": "t1_c828npm", "retrieved_on": 1431060274, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"archived": true, "author": "pickleeater", "author_flair_css_class": "blue", "author_flair_text": "13 mo. girl", "body": "There's your answer. :) ", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1358995200, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "c82i3cf", "link_id": "t3_174nlb", "parent_id": "t1_c828f06", "retrieved_on": 1431060294, "score": 4, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "[deleted]", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1358996094, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "c82ieh2", "link_id": "t3_174nlb", "parent_id": "t1_c82i26c", "retrieved_on": 1431060404, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"archived": true, "author": "beckolyn", "author_flair_css_class": "green", "author_flair_text": "Sabina (2/2012)", "body": "I envy stay-at-homes.
