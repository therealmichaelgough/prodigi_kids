Whatever you take away from this thread, please check in with your doctor about your concerns and wishes. Here are my thoughts:\n\nCircumcisions are usually performed by a OB/GYN, but are also frequently done by a pediatrician. There are three common methods for circumcision (gomco, mogen, and  plastibell) and the method your doctor chooses is, from my experience, based solely on how they were trained (as opposed to them deliberately choosing a particular method based on merit). I'd personally suggest you request that your doctor and not a resident perform the procedure. \n\nThe hospitals I've been in haven't allowed parents in the procedure room where circs are performed, but that may be different where you are. I know folks are haranguing you about not wanting to be in the room, but I think you should do what you think is best for you and your child. If you're really that uncomfortable about watching it, don't. \n\nAs for pain management, your doctor can have a topical numbing cream (EMLA) applied before the procedure, which works to varying degrees. S/he may also inject an anesthetic at the base of the penis to cause a nerve block, though this has pros and cons (the injection might be more painful than the circumcision itself, nerve blocks do have some minimal risk associated with them, it slows down the procedure, etc.) . Finally, they can provide a pacifier that is dipped in a sweet liquid which has been shown to be an effective pain management technique in infants.\n\nI've found infants post circumcision to be fairly disinterested in feeding and they generally fall asleep almost immediately after. However, if you want to offer him the breast and he takes it, all the better for both of you. The hospitals where I've been didn't bandage the circ, only covered it in A/D ointment (like vaseline).

Lets go over them\n\nLower risk of UTI during the first year. \"The absolute risk of developing a UTI in all young boys, circumcised or uncircumcised, is low (at most 1%).\" AAP so, it's already rare, along with the fact that it is EXTREMELY easy to treat (same as girls-- which btw, FGM can lower risk of uti also)\n\nLower risk of penile cancer. This is correct, I'm my sure of the numbers, but penile cancer is already extremely rare. As well as the fact that if you remove something, it can not become cancerous. If we start removing breast buds on girls, their risk for breast cancer is significantly reduced and would see MANY,MANY lives. \n\nLower risk of transmitting STDs. This has not had very good studies, but even if true, it should not at all be used in place of safe sex (monogamous relationships and condoms). Same sex is what will protect our children, not altering their genitals. \n\nBetter looking. This is completely personal. The person who owns the penis should be deciding how they want to look sexually. It's strange and almost perverse for parents to circ so their child may be deemed \"sexier\". As well as everywhere else in the world is intact, so the cut penis is abnormal. The rate of cutting neonates is dropping rapidly in the us also, although may see a rise after the latest AAP announcement. \n\nI may have missed some. These can also all be attributed to cutting of the outer parts on women (hood, vaginal lips). \nNo one argues that their aren't benefits, it's that the benefits are so small that it is not worth the major risks. (Death, complications from the surgery, complications after surgery from not enough skin/too much skin, resentment later in life, doing a non medically needed surgery on an infant with no consent)\n\nCirc risks are not studied enough, IMO. What about sexual issues later in life. We have a pretty high rate of erectile dysfunction in the us. So that makes me curious. What about emotional scarring from missing a piece of their body, and more importantly their genitals. I just don't know. When the male is old enough to learn about sex and the risks, he should be able to make a life changing decision like circ for himself.\n\n\n", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1351015579, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "c6qmecr", "link_id": "t3_11x014", "parent_id": "t1_c6qm1ms", "retrieved_on": 1430219754, "score": 4, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"archived": true, "author": "confused123456", "author_flair_css_class": "blue", "author_flair_text": "2.5 year old and 12weeks with #2", "body": "The APA does not recommend routine circumcision, and all of these medical issues are very rare.

For one, the woman 'cannot get an orgasm' myth is a myth. Many women who've been circumcised have been able to achieve orgasms. MANY men who are circumcised also have trouble performing sexually due to keratinization of the penis.

If it is not a medical necessity, don't do it. Ever. Cutting off a part of the penis is just as wrong as cutting off a finger or any other part of the body without a medical reason. There is a difference in severity (depending on the body part), but no difference in \"wrongness\".\n\nI also agree with you that male circumcision is just as *wrong* as FGM is. However, we part ways when it comes to the severity of male circumcision compared to FGM. Even the removal of the clitoral hood is not quite the same as the removal of the foreskin since the clitoris has a lot more nerve endings than the head of the penis, and those nerve endings are spread out over a much larger area in the penis. The clitoris is therefore much more sensitive and hence in more \"need\" of the protection the clitoral hood offers. And let\u2019s not forget that the vast majority of FGMs include a (partial) removal of the clitoris itself (the male equivalent, if at all comparable, would be the removal of the head of the penis).\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is you have a lot of very good arguments against male circumcision, but when trying to convince people, you will probably lose them when saying it is just as severe as FGM.

Why is it that removal of female parts is now considered to be 'genital mutilation', but doing the same to a man is not 'genital mutilation'? This is one of the biggest factors, in my opinion, in keeping male circumcision legalized and pretending that both male and female circumcision are not very similar.\n\n&gt;Even the removal of the clitoral hood is not quite the same as the removal of the foreskin since the clitoris has a lot more nerve endings than the head of the penis, and those nerve endings are spread out over a much larger area in the penis.\n\nI disagree. Where are your sources that there are \"a lot more nerve endings than the head of the penis\"? The penis head (or glans penis) is essentially the 'clitoris' of the male. Even as a fetus, the glans penis and clitoris are the SAME organ originally. I also don't understand why this argument is even relevant since the glans penis and clitoris serve the EXACT SAME purpose on both respective genders. Literally. Even if the clitoris has 'more nerve endings', wouldn't that actually justify 'clitoral hood removal' more than typical male circumcision since there would be more nerve endings in the first place?\n\n&gt;The clitoris is therefore much more sensitive and hence in more \"need\" of the protection the clitoral hood offers.\n\nI disagree. If there are more 'nerve endings' (as you proclaim) in the first place, chances are a circumcised clitoris will have far more sensitivity than a circumcised penis. In fact, having LESS nerve endings is a BETTER reason to not remove the clitoral hood/foreskin. Either way, it's a frivolous argument since neither is much better than the other and both should be banned without consent from the individual.\n\n&gt;And let\u2019s not forget that the vast majority of FGMs include a (partial) removal of the clitoris itself (the male equivalent, if at all comparable, would be the removal of the head of the penis).\n\nRight. And they are all completely illegal. Like even pricking a clitoris is literally classified as \"FGM!!111\". So what's your point? Oh, and let's not forget that over 100 boys die yearly from the procedure in the United States alone.\n\n&gt;What I'm trying to say is you have a lot of very good arguments against male circumcision, but when trying to convince people, you will probably lose them when saying it is just as severe as FGM. Which would be a shame, because more people need convincing.\n\nI disagree. I believe the fact that you love to distinguish 'male circumcision' and \"FGM!!111\" is the biggest problem here. You can't even call it 'circumcision' when its done to a woman, but not once have you referred to the identical act on a man to be 'mutilation'. The biggest problem is people thinking that they are \"nowhere near the same thing\" and justifying it in that manner. Literally. Go ask the average ignorant American and you'll hear the EXACT same argument for keeping it legal. If anything, this style of thinking is KEEPING male circumcision legal because its reinforcing the \"its not as bad as FGM\" bullshit argument.
