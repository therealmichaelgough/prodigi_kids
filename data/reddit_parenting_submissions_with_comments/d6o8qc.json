Heartbreaking though to think it was one of mine. He was so lonely and confused. Mom worked thirds and dad was out of the picture. He was home alone all the time and just...idk. I guess I didn't know him like I thought I did. \n\nThe second was a boy who accidentally brought a BB gun in his backpack. Apparently someone had shown it to him the night before and asked him to hold onto it the next day. He didn't realize it was in his bag and brought it with him. \n\nThe third happened last week. Friday the thirteenth of all days...similar to the last story except this was a full on handgun. The kid realized it was in his backpack and turned himself in immediately. His story sounded a little weird to me, but that's not my job. This one struck me hard because it shouldn't be this way. It should not be so easy for a child to get his hands on a weapon. \n\nI get so angry when anyone suggests teachers conceal carry and turn my job into a warzone. In all three of those stories, the potential shooter was a child. I could never harm a child. Someone on the internet said that a teacher who would refuse to carry a weapon clearly doesn't care about protecting kids and I was appalled at how many agreed with them. They forget teachers are people. People who love their students, but also people who go home to partners and their own babies at the end of the day. \n\nI am thankful that each experience I've had with weaponry in schools has been a false alarm.
