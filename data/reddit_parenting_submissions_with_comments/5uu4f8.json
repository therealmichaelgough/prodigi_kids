What would you have like to have been told or what would you like to have had going into your first time giving birth? \n\nThank you!\n\nedit:\nDidn't receive any responses on /r/askreddit, so I'm trying a more specific subreddit.

I'm a bit shocked that it sounds like it hurts a lot more than people make it sound, because honestly it sounds like a lot of people keep telling her it won't be as 'bad' as people say, so it seems like the opposite is kind of true.

The most important part of my second birth plan was the bit I wrote about being told of possible interventions that might be needed, how much of a chance there was of needing them, being given all the options and time to weigh them and make a decision. During the birth of my first, I felt that the midwives were worried about being supportive rather than informative, while suggesting options for a medicated birth instead of giving me all of the options. The birth plan is there to communicate with the birthing professionals, who may not know you personally, how you deal with stress, what you need to cope, etc. I would recommend writing it with that in mind, instead of writing only what your perfect birth experience would be (which is what I wrote the first time), because the moment you diverge from that plan, it becomes useless.\n\n- Keep moving during the first stage of labour. Lying down/sitting back make the pain worse (in my experience) and puts the baby in a more unfavorable position for birth. Sitting on a birthing ball is good, if it's the correct height (the one in my room was slightly too low for me, so I sat on a stool or walked).\n\n- Somebody explained about transition. The moment I told the midwife I wanted drugs and couldn't do it, she said that she knew I was about to do it because I had just said that. And then I did it, and it was the biggest relief I've ever felt. \n\n- I wish someone had told me about/emphasised cluster feeding. The first night I was home with my first baby (day 3 of his life), he wanted to breastfeed nonstop. I was going crazy from lack of sleep and called the midwives at the hospital, thinking something was wrong. They told me it was normal, he was helping establish my milk supply, and that it would pass soon.\n\n- Talk to a breastfeeding advisor, even if things are going well. They can give you valuable tips and correct slight mistakes. \n\nThings I found useful to have at the birthing centre:\n\n- Pregnancy bra/top in which to give birth. A comfortable, modest one that looked like a sports bra, but much softer. I took the black one, because I wanted a pool birth, and it wouldn't look transparent.\n\n- Shampoo, etc for a nice shower after the birth. Both times I gave birth, the first shower afterwards was heaven. I took a towel, like people recommend, but ended up using the hospital/birth centre's, because blood.\n\n- Flip flops. I knew they kept the place warm, so proper slippers wouldn't be needed, and you don't have to bend down to put on flip flops.\n\n- A portable phone battery!\n\n- Extra, extra sets of baby clothes. My second had 2 meconium poo explosions on our only night at the birth centre, and so used up all 3 sets of clothes before my husband could come back the next morning.\n\n- A dress (suitable for breastfeeding) for the first day. It's one piece and comfortable.\n\nHelpful things for when she's back home:\n\n- Help with household chores. Laundry, cleaning, vacuuming, cooking, doing the dishes, walking the dog...\n\n- Hold the baby while she showers.\n\n- Bring easy to eat food (anything she can eat with one hand or just a fork). Make sure it is filling. Husband and I once took some friends a homemade lasagna which was very appreciated.\n\n- A breastfeeding pillow (also useful for bottle feeding) and a water bottle.", "created_utc": 1487512221, "id": "ddxrn82", "link_id": "t3_5uu4f8", "parent_id": "t3_5uu4f8", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Mommit", "subreddit_type": "public"}, {"author": "icontorni", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "One of the best reminders I continually tell myself.

I talked to my friend who had a similar experience with her first, a drug free attempt that ended in a c-section, and told me how with her second she got the epidural right away and spent her whole labor reading and chatting on the phone, and how much more she enjoyed it.  It made me wonder why I had felt so much pressure to go without an epidural in the first place.  So for number two, I got one as soon as possible and I slept through as much of it as I was able so I didn't have to start of having a newborn by missing a good night's sleep.  I woke up and they told me it was time, and I was like, already?  Had to stay for jaundice with that baby too, and it was so much more enjoyable to have a new baby when I wasn't physically exhausted before they even came out. \n\nThere is a lot of great advice on here that I agree with, and won't take up the space to repeat.  I just wanted to add to the conversation that there can be an awful undercurrent of competition for new parents: epidural vs med free, breast vs bottle, baby wear vs stroller, cosleep vs own room, cry it out vs attachment, and so on, and often each side will make out like they're better than the other.

So she could keep focused...45 seconds certainly feels like forever but ten more seconds was something she could mentally handle. Bottom line; there are no bad choices, whatever she wants for herself is a good choice.

We at least have a monitor with video and a temperature thing on it I'm so glad hubs chose to get it worth every penny I would have loved an actual thing that goes on them cause that was the biggest fear until they turned one I don't even think about now that they are two. \n\nDefinitely nursing pads and will honestly say I used tissues with a lot of lanolin on between breast and breast pad because it didn't stick to it as much as the pad but pad was still better than the bra against it. \n\nIf she is planning to breastfeed she will most likely need support because it can be extremely hard for some people. Let her know you are there for WHATEVER she chooses and that what matters is the baby is healthy. Either way I had a couple fb groups that had women from around the world and it made me realize that two is actually a more normal age to wean (which makes me realize more why a handful of two year olds I know still have pacifiers) so I actually nursed my guys till a week or two over 2yrs old. I was very glad I nursed that long (especially cause I had to pump after they nursed for the first 10 months) but I was so happy that they were done when we stopped. Nursing will drain her. \n\nPersonally I very rarely drink anything but water but I did enjoy smoothies while nursing because it hey helped fill me up. I didn't get anything for myself nor want anything. I just like having my pictures and videos of them so I would say if she doesn't take pictures make sure someone does even if they are no professional pics taken just having the memories is nice (especially if you sneak a few of her with baby). \n\nNow for me, my guys made me dislike a lot of sweets (plus don't like chocolate to begin with) but if she is nursing she will definitely need quick food and a lot of water.  I watched the whole series of MASH on Netflix and I don't know what all else I watched I just knew that was a big one that I never watched until then because there was nothing else I could do.

Would have been better if the nurses would have listened to the lactation consultants at the hospital and pace fed them but whatever still worked and at least once they started to eat more solids there was more milk stored for morning and evening feed that it was so nice not having to deal with stupid bottles. I think that the 10 months of pumping is what mostly kept me going (plus it was nice in the morning to just sit in the couch and give them milk so they weren't all cranky but so glad that's done). Will say I think somewhere near 1.5 they only got milk in the morning and night I always had my guys on a schedule (obviously if they were hungry they would get milk sooner) but when they were eating solids and over a yr old I had it down to 3 feeds then the two then about 1-2 weeks before they turned two I took it to one morning feed then to none. They did like their milk but they weren't super attached (I was very glad because sometimes it would annoy me because they would scratch me or be pushing me or try pushing their brother and when I they were biting. Nothing more terrifying than when you have two set of teeth possibly ready to bite I was so on end during that phase.
