Like, okay, today is Mother's Day. That's a day where we take time to honor the mothers in our lives.

But the entire reason for dedicating a day to celebrating a certain thing is because we, collectively, recognize that it is important. If all women had the children they wanted and no mothers were ever terrible or left their children, there would literally be nothing to celebrate. Also, if you want to celebrate your dad instead, great! We have a holiday for that, it's called Father's Day.\n\nI honestly do not get the mentality of \"I don't have this thing myself, so nobody else should enjoy it.\" Or, \"I don't have this thing, so I'm going to find some way make it about ME anyway.\" \n\nNone of us has everything. You know? We all have traumas, people missing in our lives. Just because a celebration doesn't include you or your life doesn't mean it's not worthwhile or important to others. And if it brings up some pain in your own life, spend the day doing something else. You don't need to rain on everyone else's parade.
