Reposted from two chromosomes sub someone recommended I post here.\n\nSo a little background. I had a planned pregnancy, average working class person with a working class boyfriend who is a lot older than me. He has other child who are grown up who he helped raise and had kids young since in his culture during that time it was the thing to do. He loves his kids and loves this baby too. I am so lucky, while I have been crying and in pain he has been loving the baby and holding the baby while working and not once has lost patience with us. We wanted a baby more than anything and enjoyed my pregnancy though I did have a traumatic childhood also (mom was great doesn't even drink a beer, had a traumatic childhood also. dad loves me but...he also had a terrible childhood full of abuse and poverty and was a drug addict and alcoholic) so it's a repeating pattern in my family that hasn't really been broken by any of us and I have a huge family. I hope to fix myself so that my child doesn't have to grow up the way his father, me, and my parents did (I also never touch drugs or alcohol either does his dad)\n\nSo to the story. I turned 41 weeks last Friday and woke up having contractions. SO was looking at me and decided he was gonna stay home anyways because he felt like this was it. We had a false alarm a few weeks ago and he stayed with me all night in the hospital. So he goes to see his mami and sister quick because I wanted to go to Walmart with my friend and walk the baby out. I called the clinic and they had me come in and timed my contractions 2-5 minutes but my BP was 157/98. It went down 150/98 so they told me to go to labor and delivery ASAP. I was in labor 3cm 100% effaced 0 station baby. I got there and called SO with a few demands and he got all the stuff together and packed cheese (yes cheese? lol he passed out cheese to my parents and best friend). We got there everything was peaceful and my BP went down to 130s/70s and continued to normal. The nurse came in and put the iv and said the doc wanted to start pitocin since I was still 3cm after a few days.\n\nSo after I started pitocin they said I have to have an epidural because my labor would be very hard. They were going to turn the pitocin all the way up. I said no. They came in with an iv pain med saying it would make me sick but they zofran before it happens. I'm scared of being sick. They also said it would hurt my baby more than the epidural. So I decided to go with the epidural. My boyfriend was scared because it was a needle in my back and my parents and friend say that he paced back and forth to the door and waiting room. So anyways I was feeling okay then slowly feeling one side. They got more meds and I still felt it but they couldn't do much more. Around 4am I felt so much pain. I called out for my bf who was in the couch and the nurse came in and told me to go to sleep. I couldnt with the pain and thought I just wasn't managing. By the time I was hysterical they checked me at 10 cm but baby had flipped Sunny side up and went back up the birth canal. They had me push for an hour and he wasn't coming down. They said I needed a c section and asked who was coming to be with me and my bf scrubbed up. I was still screaming because I can't remember the pain but I remember I was in so much nothing made me feel better. They rolled me in screaming and I was just looking at the ceiling and started to go numb. They did test cuts to see if I could feel the saddle block working. On the right side I realized I could and told them. They kept putting meds in and I could still feel. I looked at my boyfriend and said I was okay and he looked scared. Last thing I remember.\n\nMy boyfriend had said at that time I started screaming as they cut me and they told him to get out and they put me under immediately. My boyfriend was brought our baby and he cooed and loved and my parents say hoarded the baby. He is still hoarding baby.\n\nI woke up to going down the hallway and my boyfriend out my baby to me and told me to kiss our baby. I was crying apparently and reaching for him. In recovery I was crying in between waking up because I wanted my baby.  \n\n\nPost partum had a different feel then labor and delivery and the ob. They weren't as nice. They were very inconvenienced by helpless me and would ignore me calling them. So I would send my boyfriend out. I just figured there was other moms that were sick or babies that were sick that needed them more. I had my baby at 6am so at 7pm I finally got my Cath removed. She told me after to tell her when I needed to pee. My boyfriend cared for our baby and me too. He brought me food once I was able to have it and everything else.\n\nSo the 2nd incident I called the nurse and told her I needed to pee. She came in and checked my vitals and told me she would be right back to help me she had another patient. So I  waited and waited. An hour later I called. The receptionist was snooty. I called 45 minutes later saying could my boyfriend just help me, she said no. 15 minutes later I send him out to the the nurse. She cane back and i told her I may pee myself. She cheerly said \"it's okay if you pee yourself\". After that my boyfriend helped me up and to the bathroom. \n\n3rd thing was later on that night I woke up feeling sick with fever. I called and told the nurse. She said okay someone would be in. Half hour later I had my boyfriend get the baby thermometer out of my bag. 100.6. I called and said I had a fever. She was snooty saying she would send someone. Half hour later I started getting scared I had an infection and told my boyfriend I didn't wanna die there. He went and got the nurse again. She came in and it was 101.6. things got serious other nurses came in and said I needed tylenol and the Dr ordered antibiotics 3 kinds, and then blood work. About 5 draws in one arm Because the iv was in the other. My fever stayed the whole night.\n\nThe morning nurses came in and asked if I walkiled yet. I said the bathroom. She got rude and asked why. I said I wasn't allowed. The other nurse told her that i had only had 2 tylenol to treat my pain and then asked if innew about the other pain relief options. The night nurses had only told me tylenol for pain. She asked if I showered and I told her no I wasn't allowed yet. Then asked about the fever. I told her about the fever and the almost peeing myself. The nurse told me I had the fever because I was forced to stay in bed and not shower or move for 24 hours. I had asked night nurse to walk because I didn't want a clot and she said that's what compression socks were for. Later that day when I had my shower the nurse had discovered the socks cut into my skin but I wasn't allowed to remove them during the night. So anyways the nurse had told the supervisor the way I was treated and it was okay kind of. I did realize the 2 days I was there I didn't get my wound cleaned at all. My I realized that as soon as they told me to clean 4 times a day.\n\nSo I didn't realize how sad I was until a few hours before I was released. I started crying uncontrollably like mental breakdown cry. I told my boyfriend I loved our baby and his little face was so cute. But I couldn't understand how he was mine because I didn't remember having him. Then when I was in bed helpless to soothe him and watch my boyfriend do it I was unconsolable and kept saying I'm sorry I ruined your life you wont ever sleep again. He's order and I had a vision of basically killing him because of our baby waking him up. I was so sad. It's been 5 days and I feel like a failure. I regret my baby but I love him and his little squishy face. I keep crying as soon as my boyfriend gets home. Idk what to do. I know this may be post partum but it may also be because of my hospital experience. I also say the supervisor gave me a $16 be quiet gift card for the care I received. Also my boyfriend loves the baby and never gave me a thought he didn't want the baby.\n\nTL;DR: hard labor, cut into me too fast, nurse left me needing to pee after Cath for over an hour, spiked a fever and was ignored, I feel like a bad mom and like I ruined my boyfriends life. I can't connect with my baby and I don't feel like he's mine.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3", "subreddit_subscribers": 36809, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I jist had a beautiful baby and a traumatic labor.

First and foremost, you're not a bad mom. The first couple of weeks after birth are really tough, even when you've had an uneventful labor.

You should make an appointment to see your OB/GYN and tell them how you're feeling, and have them check your surgery site and for a UTI/bladder infection just in case. \n\nIf you're in the U.S. I'd also look into legal counsel. I usually don't recommend suing people, but this was exceptionally bad and dangerous care, and at the very least I think the health care providers at that hospital should be reviewed. If you do get legal advice, tell them about the gift card as well. That shows they know they messed up.\n\nThings *will* get better as long as you ask for help. Make sure you're honest with your doctor about how you're feeling, and try not to feel guilty about asking your bf for help. It doesn't sound like he's upset about spending time with the baby, so don't beat yourself up about it. If you have other family members you feel comfortable around, ask them for some help while you get back on your feet. Even having someone come over to cook meals and clean house will be a huge help while you're healing from your surgery.\n\nWishing you the best of luck!

Once I got there there was no walking, no bouncing, all my research and it was useless. I don't feel like less because of the c section. I was a good pusher. The pitocin was cranked up and the pain was never ending for 4 hours with an epidural, a botched epidural but still. I felt more sad I had to have pain meds. They told me epidural or IV meds. But that iv meds could hurt the baby more and I didn't wanna hurt him so I just gave in since there was no saying no. \n\nThat's what I really hated, I didn't get a choice. When my iv blew and i requested I didn't have to have another iv they said no I have to because Iv would work faster than oral (true but still). Then the iv spot was just idk. They stabbed me 4 times and all because I didn't want it in my right arm. I told them any other vein because my blood had been drawn four times on that same arm. And also my non flat nipple was in that side and that nipple didn't need the shield. She kept telling the other nurses \"I just really like this vein\". I told her no Iv, they said I have to. The other nurse started poking around and said she was going to put in in my wrist so I just said...fine put it in the sore arm that I had 4 needles in. She cheerly accepted. So that's why I was out Monday and not Wednesday. I told my family I couldn't sleep, the iv kept going off when I fed my baby, when I just got him to sleep they would come in like they knew and put a cold scope on him..not during the day though...only at night. So then helpless me tired boyfriend screaming baby. So I started walking my IV pole to the nurses every time it made a noise. I also started aggressively insisting I got home.

I am so sorry this happened to you and I highly recommend you look into counseling to help you through this. You need to be reminded that you are not a bad mother - these were circumstances outside of your control and the experts in charge failed you. If you aren\u2019t able to get counseling (which I understand, it can be difficult just to focus on staying alive during the newborn stage), please at least look in the mirror every day and say out loud self-affirming statements. Tell your reflection things like:\n\n-I am a good person\n\n-I am strong and capable\n\n-I am the best mom for this baby\n\n-I am doing the best I can\n\n-I deserve time to heal and relax\n\n\nOne more thing - it sounds like your boyfriend is doing a standup job and has developed an instant love for the baby. This is great! But you were robbed of the very important time just after birth that helps a mom connect with her baby. So now you need to make sure you take all the time you can to bond with your baby. It is okay if you don\u2019t feel a connection with the baby for a while - this is completely normal and it can take time to develop. DO NOT beat yourself up if you don\u2019t feel the love for your baby that you expected to feel or that society tells you that you should feel. The best thing you can do is have some skin to skin alone time with the baby every day. You can do this whether you are bottle feeding or breastfeeding.

All of the overwhelming new experiences, the pain, the hormones your body is dealing with... It all takes some time to work out. I have been through it 3 times and it does take some time to feel like you have a handle on life again. You are not alone! It took me until day 2 of having my baby at home (she's 7 weeks today) before I truly felt that I was starting to bond with her. It takes time. You have this tiny creature constantly yelling and squirming and you don't know exactly what to do. It took me 3 weeks to get into a routine and really start to know my baby when I had my first. Try not to overthink it. The love and bonding you were expecting to feel will come eventually. In the meantime, please talk to your doctor about how you're feeling. They can help. And don't beat yourself up for how you feel. You're human and you're allowed to have feelings. Even when they don't match up with hallmark cards, there is no shame in reality.
