My ex told me there is going to be a flight attendant with her at all times, he paid more for that he says, she will board first and last. I can't leave til her plane leaves and she won't be handed off without my ex or his wife presenting their id. Everything sounds good and in order but my anxiety is thru the roof. I hate hate hate the thought of her afraid and alone on a plane. My mom and fiance said the worst part is take off and I hate knowing I won't be there to hold her hand. I'm also afraid of some freak accident happening, although I know it's safer up there than in a car.
