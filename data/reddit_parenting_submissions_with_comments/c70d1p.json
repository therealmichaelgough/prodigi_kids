Example: my husband is great about getting the kids out for adventures outside, I just feel like I do all the not fun parts. The other day he takes them on a very long hike while I packed up our house for move. If our daughter doesn't poop by about 2:00 it will start to leak out and she gets constipated. They got back around 7 pm and of course she had not pooped and had probably been walking around with skid marks in her underwear for awhile. So of course she gets a bladder infection and is dealing with that the whole drive across country when we're moving. And guess who has to deal with finding an urgent Care, getting her to take her antibiotics, getting her to drink water, making sure she's peeing even though it hurts, making sure she poops and drinks lots of apple juice so she can poop. Then I need to make sure she takes a probiotic so she doesn't get a yeast infection. \n\nWhat tips do you have for getting your partner to engage in this stuff more? I'm so tired of being the bad guy who cleans up messes. I get it from his perspective, if someone else was doing all the worrying, I'd sit back and do the fun stuff too. But if I just don't engage and let things run their course, then we end up with bigger messes that I get to clean up", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3", "subreddit_subscribers": 74562, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Tips for guiding dad to do the non-fun stuff?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1561909127, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/c70d1p/tips_for_guiding_dad_to_do_the_nonfun_stuff/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, "comments": [{"all_awardings": [], "approved_at_utc": null, "author": "PinkKittenOldSoul", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3yszwjcs", "author_patreon_flair": false, "banned_at_utc": null, "body": "Send him a couple articles on emotional labor, especislly that one that's called something like \"my wife divorced me because i didn't do the dishes\"", "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "created_utc": 1561823184, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "gildings": {}, "id": "esc7ynb", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_c70d1p", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_c70d1p", "permalink": "/r/Mommit/comments/c70d1p/tips_for_guiding_dad_to_do_the_nonfun_stuff/esc7ynb/", "retrieved_on": 1561823185, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3", "total_awards_received": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "approved_at_utc": null, "author": "picardjaneway", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_xuwtebz", "author_patreon_flair": false, "banned_at_utc": null, "body": "Lol good call, I have talked to him about this concept before.

I have a lot of thoughts on this. \n\n\nAs a boy, you don't realize how much you internalize the socially normal habit of men working outside the home and women working inside the home (I recognize this is heteronormative but most of the time these issues regard a man and a woman). Even as society has moved towards encouraging more equal gender roles over time, we're still at a place where men are congratulated for \"chipping in\" at home instead of equally co-managing the household. \n\nAn example: When my son was born, I received huge amounts of praise from friends and family for getting up at 2-3am every morning and giving my son a bottle so my wife could get a full REM sleep cycle. I received huge additional praise for washing her pump parts before bed. \n\nAnd that's crazy. Even today, when ostensibly gender roles are supposed to becoming more fluid, I was being congratulated for doing what felt like *the absolute  minimum* while my wife was doing 99% of the work.  \n\nThe issue is that society as a whole still expects too little from men. And men internalize all of that messaging. It's in our upbringing, it's in our media, and we hear it from friends and family We're congratulated for doing any chores at all. Then there are men like your husband who feel like they're going above and beyond because they'll do anything, \"you just have to ask.\" And according to society, that IS above and beyond. \n\nThe issue is that obviously that's far from equal or equitable. Doing chores \"when asked\" doesn't split the mental planning burden, and men often shrug the emotional support burden for their families as well. The justification is often \"I have a job so I should be able to relax at home\" which is bullshit because while my wife was on maternity leave with our newborn, she did way more work, for way longer hours, with *no breaks* than I did at my \"real job.\" Men often are not taught to appreciate how constantly tiring child care can be. When I commuted to work, I was alone and listened to audiobooks. At work I got to take breaks when I wanted and spend time chatting with adults. I got to eat a full, warm lunch. My wife got none of these things.\n\nA big issue is that most men don't really appreciate or understand the mental burden. The concept of taking responsibility for things outside of work: the health, happiness, and well-being of the children; the tidiness and cleanliness of the home; the logistical and recurring tasks that need to be done to keep the family financially, logistically, and emotionally on track. There are a lot of articles/blogs/comics out there that discuss the mental burden that (classically) women assume. It's worth looking at those together and discussing ways to share this more equitably. Discuss ways that your husband can be \"mentally on\" at home too; ways to look at the home as if it was *his responsibility* to maintain. He sees dishes in the sink, he does them. The dishwasher is full? He empties it. The rug is dirty? Vacuum it. Food is running low? Add to the shopping list of *gasp* go shopping. Men don't realize it but when they are saying \"just ask me and I'll do it,\" they're asking their partners to be their administrative assistants as well as their wives. Men need to learn to take inventory of their own lives and approach home/child/relationship issues like they are ultimately responsible. \n\nUltimately what worked for me and my wife was talking about *all* of the work we do every day: physical, mental, emotional. And instead of using \"Society's expectations\" as a starting point, we looked at everything in front of us and talked about ways to split it more equitably. A side note, it's important not to simply divide up tasks (e.g. \"You do all the pet things, I'll do all the kitchen things\" etc.) because then the mom becomes the *de facto* person responsible for NEW business. Talk about ways for both partners to see everything through a lens of responsibility and communicate constantly about ways to improve.", "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "created_utc": 1561827858, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "gildings": {}, "id": "escessi", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_c70d1p", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_c70d1p", "permalink": "/r/Mommit/comments/c70d1p/tips_for_guiding_dad_to_do_the_nonfun_stuff/escessi/", "retrieved_on": 1561827859, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3", "total_awards_received": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "approved_at_utc": null, "author": "zbplot", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5p1i4", "author_patreon_flair": false, "banned_at_utc": null, "body": "I went to the grocery store with my husband and made him chose the quantity of diapers we needed to buy.

I see us continuing to grow more but I think I need to find less exhaustive ways. \n\nFor example: I put on 65 pounds with our son. I have lost all 65 and damnit I never even realized bc I was busy with our son, graduate school and working PT. \n\nI\u2019ve lost so much that a few weeks ago we went to the outlets and I pretty much had to buy a small mini wardrobe. Thank God I will find a sale!\n\nFast foreword to now, he makes breakfast this morning and fried 2/3 components. Plaintains and bacon. I told him I could only eat the boiled eggs and would have fruit. He kind of gets huffy but never says anything. I can sense him and eventually we argued and he left with our son to his shop. Fast foreword he\u2019s forgotten about the argument and is spending time with our son, which is what I want so I can also study and work on papers. \n\nBut damn, between his need to balance his schedule between work and home and his eating habits, this is exhaustive. I need tips bc I\u2019m burning myself out. \n\nI\u2019m an accountant by education and trade so I\u2019ve helped him start and partially fund 3 small businesses which in turn give him the flexibility and slow but steady income to make his own schedule, pick up and drop off our son, and me be in graduate school with no job and still have all our basic bills covered. I just need him to now balance it and he can\u2019t and is basically working all the time. \n\nHe eventually listens but the whole run around that I\u2019ve got to go through consumes me for a few hours where I can focus on anything else bc I\u2019ve got my own ADHD. I work well with structure and organization.

We have rejection sensitive dysphoria, so your husband getting huffy and you being able to \"sense\" his upset seems like an example of both of you taking things too personally. He's upset that you rejected his breakfast offering, and you're upset that he cooked things that he should know you won't eat.

I'm the one that works in my family, and it's super stressful being the only one bringing income. Sometimes I feel like all I do is work! Finding balance for your husband truly might be an impossible task for the time being. Also, I eventually gave up on trying to influence my husband's eating habits, and we are all much happier.

I saved the thread someone posted earlier about mental load. I\u2019m going to save it to send it as a text when he goes to use the bathroom tomm since he likes to sit on his phone and scroll. Our son will be with my mom and sister for about two weeks while I finish up this semester. \n\nMy husband is totally ADHD. No doubt in my mind what so ever.

Both having ADHD, pregnant, a wedding, a birth, a new condo that he rebuilt for us, sold our old place, wiped out all debt except student loans, and now I\u2019m back in grad school. We were broke as hell for a while and started falling behind before we decided to sell. I want to stay on track and he does too. He just needs a little guidance and I\u2019m exhausted, but our son is amazing! I love that my husband supports me going back to grad school for Ed. and that I do not have to work while in this program (although I have no idea when I\u2019d find the time either) but I also focus on our sons development and education, which my husband loves and so do I. I\u2019ve always loved Ed., but to also be able to help our son and other children is a purposeful life for me. \n\nLike I said, my husband hated working for someone else, and I helped him achieve that.

Damn as I reread this, it\u2019s a lot, but I\u2019m hopeful I think in the end, it\u2019ll be worth the little storm to get us in couples therapy bc when I talk to his grandma, she\u2019s always advocating family time and balance bc she didn\u2019t enjoy her kids running a business. My husbands mother has always worked a lot, and not spent time with him and his brother. It\u2019s a pattern I\u2019ve come to realize today and he doesn\u2019t see it. I\u2019m starting to wonder if maybe working for someone else is better for him, but he will only last but for so long and is not happy. I can see it and his overall levels of energy. \n\nHe\u2019s happy working for himself but no one is there to tell him, ok enough time for your wife and kid. He heads home when he\u2019s tired and by then, the baby is asleep and I\u2019m running on fumes. I\u2019m left with I don\u2019t even know what. \n\nIll work on figuring out how we could get therapy, costs, and who would be a good fit for us.
