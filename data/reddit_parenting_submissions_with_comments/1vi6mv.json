He is extremely intelligent. The psychiatrist we've been seeing for his issues suggested development testing and he scored highly gifted. He may be a smart boy, but he also has the worst behavior of any three-year-old child I have ever seen.\n\nSome backstory. He has been a difficult child since birth. He was up 5-6 times per night until he was 14 months old. At the age of 3, he still doesn\u2019t sleep through the night most nights. He also had colic, and screamed close to 8 hours a day for months on end. He is sick all the time. He will go maybe a week without cold symptoms and then be sick for months on end (we\u2019ve investigated allergies but he has tested negative for everything so far). He also has gastrointestinal problems. He\u2019s had borderline diarrhea since starting on solid food (we\u2019ve tried various elimination diets but nothing has made a difference). He also has never been able to play happily on his own, always requiring someone to be with him, entertaining him. On a great day, he\u2019ll play on his own happily for five minutes. Tops. \n\nHe has an incredible impulse control problem. He is violent with me, his father, and the other kids at his daycare. The violence is very typically unprovoked. For example, last week he got out of his cot during nap at daycare, picked up a shoe and hit another sleeping child in the head. According to the staff, she and my son hadn't even played together that day.  He will walk up to me while I\u2019m cooking dinner and hit me with his toys. When I react in pain, he often laughs.\n\nHe has no attention span. He cannot even maintain eye contact with you when you are trying to talk to him, always looking around for other things he can focus on. He has no patience and no fuse. If something doesn\u2019t go his way, he erupts in anger immediately, screaming, crying, throwing things, or hitting whoever happens to be nearby.  \n\nHe is also hyperactive. He never walks anywhere, even in the house. He runs and jumps. He cannot sit still for more than 10 seconds (unless we are reading to him). And he never shuts his mouth. He literally must be talking ever second of every day. We never get a break.\n\nHe is also not yet potty trained. He knows how to use the potty, but chooses not to. He'd rather go in his pull-ups, and then laughs when we have to change them. We have tried putting him in underwear, but he pees and poops in that too. \n\nEveryday when I pick him up from daycare, I get the \u201cdamage report\u201d: how many other children he hurt, how many naps he disrupted etc. Between the potty training, the refusal to nap and the violent behavior with other children, the daycare is threatening to kick him out. And I can\u2019t blame them. I\u2019d kick him out too.\n\nI want to be clear: I do not have unrealistic expectations for my child. He's three. I expect a certain amount of violence, tantrums, impulse control problems, hyperactivity etc. My issue is that he is off the chart on all these things when compared to his peers. And we have tried EVERYTHING to improve his behavior: rewards, praise, negative reinforcement, punishment (i.e. taking toys away), timeouts, counting\u2026 everything. We have done exhaustive investigations of his health issues, spanning allergy testing, dietary changes, family doctors, specialists, psychiatrists, counselors\u2026 nothing has helped.\n\nBottom line is, because of all these issues, I have never felt attachment to this child, and grow more distant from him after every battle, every violent outburst. My resentment for him grows. I resent him because we always wanted to have two kids, but there is no way we will have a second one after him. I resent him because he has therefore robbed me of my opportunity to parent a normal, loving child.  I resent him because he loves his father more than he loves me, even when he is the disciplinarian and I am not.  I resent him because I go to bed each and every day exhausted, angry and broken, on the verge of an anxiety attack.  I resent him because instead of enjoying time playing with my child, I dread it because I know it will only end in one of us screaming, and me with some kind of physical injury.\n\nSo, r/mommit\u2026 where do I go from here? I am desperate. I have tried parental counseling, as well as child psychiatry with no help.  We cannot ask for more childcare from my family, and cannot afford to hire outside babysitting right now.  I need to get these feelings of distance and resentment under control, so that I can be a better parent. I need to fix his behaviours so that I don\u2019t have a mental breakdown. \n\nThanks to everyone who made it through this monster post. I\u2019ll take any and all advice/criticism/suggestion.\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I resent my child", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/1vi6mv/i_resent_my_child/"}, "comments": [{"archived": true, "author": "LadyGrizabella", "author_flair_css_class": "purple", "author_flair_text": "IAMA mom to an Aspie AMA!", "body": "::hugs::\n\nHas he been tested for Asperger's or Oppositonal Defiant Disorder or Pervasive Developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS)?

Full stop. There were 3 things that turned my kid around (in order of importance):\n\n1. He learned to read.  Part of not being able to sleep and the misbehavior in the day was due to boredom.  My kid needs information flowing into his brain *all the time*.  He was fluently reading 20 books a day at 4 and it made him happier than he'd ever been.  Being allowed to read in bed for 30 minutes with a flashlight became the *one* bedtime routine that actually helped him wind down, (we'd tried everything), and he was suddenly able to fall asleep before 11 PM.\n\n2. Sleeping more than 8 hours at night (reading beat sleeping because it made this possible).\n\n3. Turning 5 and becoming less self-centered and more logical. \n\nHang in there.  Being an asshole at 3 doesn't mean he'll always be a jerk, but you'll need to figure out what's causing the behavior first.  Please research the effects of sleep deficits on preschoolers and see if they're describing your kid.  I think there's a definite link between intelligence and and trouble sleeping.  \n\nAlso, I really resented my kid, too, but I focused on all his good qualities and stressed them and reminded him and me of them *constantly*, but I really didn't like the kid until he was 5.  Now I can't imagine ever feeling those feelings toward him.  He was nuts, though, and I've mostly forgiven myself for it.

She was backed up but would have a bowel movement regularly,  so I was unaware. But that helped sort some digestive issues out and helped her mood. It is also a great idea to take a probiotic if you had diarrhea or been sick to help balance the gut baacteria. Since your son has had bowel issues, he may do well on one. It is not covered by insurance though. \n\nMy daughter has some sensory issues. Not enough to get diagnosed, but I use some of the coping mechanisms to help her through. We also do no dyes or gluten and this has greatly helped with outbursts. She absolutely can not have dyes. She gets this crazed wild eye look and just turns into a gremlin, she is impossible to calm down and it ends in a sensory overload meltdown and everyone frazzled.

(Especially gluten and red and yellow dyes.) You may want to eliminate some things from his diet one at a time and see if that works.\n\nI also have a crazy wild monkey for a daughter (age 4 now). And 3 was RIDICULOUS!  She started out crazy from the amount of hard kicks she was constantly giving me in he womb, but 3 was especially crazy. I have heard that terrible 3's and 4's are worse than terrible 2's. \n\nBut a few things that worked for her: an emotionally calm consequence-based discipline. (You may have already tried this) but whenever I got worn out, annoyed, angry, she would play off of it. So I would stay as calm as possible (better said than done) but make the punishment fit the crime. For instance, she would run from me at parks towards busy streets. So we stopped going. She would ask to go to a park and for a week I would tell her: \"I just cannot handle it when you run from me. So no parks for a while. I have to make sure you are safe.\"  \n\nI think the trick for her was to wait until she was calm. If I warn her of the consequence when she is crazy or energetic, she won't care. But when she calmly asks for something and I refuse it in a calm manner, it really seeps in. \n\nI also feel like most of my consequences are based on taking care of myself and not letting my child abuse me or hold the power in the relationship. Yet, if I am calm, love is still communicated.  \n\nAlso, when I realized her strengths and talents, it becomes easier to like her. (I will always love her, but you know, sometimes you don't LIKE your kids...)  But there are things that she really excels at. Signed her up for dance, she ran around the room like an animal the whole time. Gave her some blocks, she sat for hours working on different designs and constructions. She will sit for hours to learn about science, especially if it is medical. That made me realize that her crazy energy can actually be used for good and not evil!  And sometimes I wonder if she is crazy because she is not mentally and physically challenged enough throughout the day. (We watch a lot of tv...)\n\nSo maybe try out a few things (I hear martial arts is especially good for kids with this kind of energy.) to challenge and satiate your son's intense energy? Then you may be able to appreciate it and not just resent it. \n\nGood luck, though. My blood pressure still rises whenever I think of my daughter's terrible 3's. When we tried time outs, she would destroy things or just scream at us. When we spanked her, she would just laugh at us. And I would feel the same distance and resentment when our relationship was nothing but power plays. But she got better and so did I. And hopefully that will happen for you as well! I just hope you don't feel like a bad mom or anything, because obviously you are trying so hard for your son when it is anything but easy. And that is an amazing example of love that I think your son will someday understand.

My son is 4 and while he has not had so many of the struggles you are describing, I am betting you are looking for any and all ideas, so here's a few that came to mind for me.\n\n- take care of yourself.  it's important and it's so urgent.  you cannot be your best and feel good if you aren't.  consider it a health emergency, tell your DH that, and find a way.  you are worth it!  step one - get more sleep. \n\n- is it possible to fine even one thing a day you guys can do that is just fun? that won't end badly? something that you can enjoy that can be a nice memory .. more of those will push some of the negative ones out of the way?    \n\n- Maybe just take a break from him.  can you?  can your husband take some vacation time?  Maybe you just need to be around each other less for a while.  that is totally ok.  you didn't say if you work, or if hubs does, or both.. but at my house, my husband works, I don't... and he gets greeted like a hero every night.  lucky him.  he didn't have to 'do battle' all day.  It would be great if Daddy can take a turn.  frankly, it seems like you are at 'emergency' level - maybe you just have to tell him he has to find a way.\n\n- my son has been sick 14 times in the last 12 months or so - I FEEL YOU on the constant illnesses.  DS's are fevers and nausea.  for a WEEK.  hot, lethargic and won't eat.  he is in the bottom 5% weight category - officially underweight!!  the sicknesses are killing me, but I have had three docs say that it's just his age, and some kids get runny noses, others have fevers.  I don't have a solution on this one, but I feel your pain - it is wearing me down and really putting a strain on me and husband b/c we can't always agree on what to do!  \n\n- I have a really strong memory of tucking my son in bed one night at the end of a tough day that involved time outs, and having to 'fix' a mistake he made (erasing pencil on walls).  the strangest thing happened - I asked him about his day and he smiled and said he had a really good day.  and I told him I was proud he fixed his mistake.  and he smiled such a contented smile.  and I honestly think he felt safe and content b/c he had seen so much evidence of the rules around him, and he had met the challenge.   when you commented about your son loving daddy even though he's the disciplinarian, this just came to mind - the old saying that kids need discipline, and consistent discipline - and when they have it, they feel safe and happier.  Not to imply that I think you aren't doing it (sounds like you have tried everything!), but I'm just wondering if a VERY smart child needs an even MORE hardlined approach, for a longer time??  Can you go back to some of the discipline techniques and try them again, for even longer?  he sounds VERY VERY smart and like he is testing you at every turn.  every. turn.  you must be so exhausted!  \n\n- what about starting small, with one behaviour, and one discipline technique, and just keep it going ... pick one thing that you are going to have absolutely ZERO tolerance for.  like running in the house.  every time he runs, you pick him up and put him in time out.  no discussion - just 'you are running, it is not allowed, so you must sit in timeout'.  and you just do it every single time.  it will be tiring, but he's going to get so tired of having his playing interrupted, he's got to give up.  and he will respect you and get it that you are not going to budge and not going to ever make an exception. Once you conquer that one, then pick the next one - hitting with toys maybe.  our rule is, if you hit with a toy, or throw a toy, the toy is taken away immediately, no discussion, and put at the top of the tall bookshelf.  And there have been many tears, but that's the rule.  What I like about this is I don't have to get mad. I just enforce the rule and go back to what I am doing.  \n\n- with the discipline, since he's so smart, maybe pick techniques that get him to do something because HE wants to.  E.g. he doesn't want to lose the toy.  or, he doesn't want to have his play interrupted.  those are nice things he loses.  maybe that would work more than things that are bad.  My 2 yr old has already shown me that she is willing to get spanked, just so she can kick me one more time.  The minute I saw the look in her eye that said 'yeah, it wasn't so bad', I just stopped spanking.  she'll take the pain in order to do what she wants.  \n\n- look really hard for things he is doing well, and praise him for them - just a bit more positive energy may be a good thing? \n\n- I would also make it clear you respect yourself, and he must respect you too.  If he is trying to hurt or anger you, you can step away.    And say to him, 'I cannot help you if you are being disrespectful (or, hurting me, or whatever).  And just remove yourself from the situation - even if it is just stepping back a few feet and stopping what you are doing.\n\nI wish you so much good luck!  and also strength. you are bigger, smarter and in charge!  Believe in yourself :)\n\nedit:  got to seem more of your answers after posting this.  ... having read more of your background and some of these exchanges, I wonder if it would be a useful intellectual exercise to just think - what answers would I look for if I knew for certain that he has no medical 'problems' - either physical physical health or mental health.    Yes he is very smart, but other than that, nothing.  no allergies, no OT problems, no sensory overload, nothing.  Could anything else explain all of this behaviour?    I don't know what conclusion you may come to, but it might be liberating and very helpful.  And, while I completely agree that as a parent you cannot stop looking until you find an answer... it also seems to me, as one small opinion, that you have seen a LOT of specialists.   I am almost afraid to type that b/c I do not want to seem unsupportive.  But as an off the wall type A, I often rely on my husband to tell me when I have gotten too intense and zealous about something.  and since you are looking for any and all ideas, I feel like this one should be in the mix.  \n\nedit #2:  how much is your husband involved in the search for answers?  what does he think?  I have also had some humbling experiences when I was convinced I was the only one who could fix it, and I was basically beating a dead horse working on the wrong problem and solution (in my case, breast feeding was not working and my son was underweight), and ignoring what my husband thought... and was even mad at my husband for his wrong, offensive opinion... but somehow I managed to step back and get a second opinion... and my husband was right.  100%, totally right.  but I was so convinced I was going to solve it, and I could figure it out, and I was not wrong... well.  yeah.  I was wrong.  wrong, wrong, wrong.

My friend's kid's behavioral problems were totally fixed by cutting out gluten. I know yall are super busy, but you love cooking right? Maybe this could be a healthy cooking challenge? I also second the ideas about the OT sensory processing center.\n\nAnother thought- **Maybe this kid is a genius**... If the gluten thing doesn't work out, what if you tried some intense tutoring or something? Or maybe there's something online to get him the educational stimulation he needs without breaking the bank? I know a kid who taught himself piano by watching youtube. Or maybe your son is kinda like [this awesome kid.

When kids figure out that they can make an adult lose it, they do.  Getting mom mad and having her act calmly isn't nearly as fun/exciting/empowering as getting her mad and having her yell and scream.  So, you may not be hiding your feelings, but I think you're doing great.  When he asks \"Why are you using your quiet voice?\" I think it's fine to tell him that you are upset/tired/grouchy/disappointed but you don't like to yell.\n\nAlso, for both your sanity, is there something you guys can all do together where your son will have a hard time getting in trouble?
