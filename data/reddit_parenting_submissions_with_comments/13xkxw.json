And I know, it could be worse. But hear me out. \n\nThe first thing I usually see is dishes left on the floor by my fiance. Or empty beer bottles, trash, etc. He leaves for work super early in the morning (like 2 am) and works til the afternoon. I get it, he works a lot. But I don't think its fair to pick up after him all the time. \n\nOk, not all the time. Maybe once a week he picks up our bedroom, but that's it. I asked him to do one chore 3 days ago, and guess who is getting ready to do that today. \n\nThe worst part is, I waste all morning cleaning and cooking. And all afternoon. I don't get to really play with the kids as much as I like. By the time I'm done with everything, I have to go to work and he gets to come home and the only thing he does is heat up the dinner I made them, change a diaper, and brush their teeth. If I work a short shift I get to come home and do this too. \n\nWe are blessed that we have family that takes the kids on weekends, takes them boating, swimming, to church, etc. Because I work 10+ hour days on the weekends and the family loves seeing them. It sucks that I never really get a day off. Either I'm taking care of the kids and then going to work, or working all day. I know I'm probably pissing off a lot of stay at home or single moms; this probably sounds like first world problems to you guys, and I'm sorry. It just makes me sad that on weekends when they're not here, he is off work but doesn't do much except see his friends and relax. Which he is entitled to do. But it would be great if he could cross a couple things off my to-do list while I'm gone. \n\nAnd like I said, I get it. He works a lot. But I do too. I am starting to feel kind of worthless. I should be able to handle all this. I did great as a single mom. But when I have someone here who should be sharing the responsibility, and isn't, I have to ask myself what I'm doing wrong and why he doesn't think I need a break. It's getting harder and harder to just get out of bed because my life is constant work, no breaks (except to browse reddit on my phone while I'm cooking or whatever), and nothing to show for it-as far as having a good time with the kids. When we talk about it he gets all mad and tells me he's tired. I'm tired too but I guess that doesn't matter. ):\n\nSorry for the wall of text. Any advice would be appreciated.

Ages 2 and 4? That is so tough! But the good news is that it gets easier and easier, especially if you get your kids involved early learning how to do simple household tasks. And I know it seems hard to believe now, but the time really does Go. So. Fast. Before you know it they will be off to college and you will miss the days when cleaning and cooking gave you something to do, because cleaning and cooking for just two adults who work full time only requires a few minutes a day. \n\nSecond, what helped me *immensely* back then was recognizing that the one that wants the house clean the most, is the one that does the cleaning. There's no reason to resent if the other isn't pulling the weight. They just don't care as much as you or I might. I do love a clean house. I tried the \"go on strike\" thing and that worked to a certain extent. The hubby would eventually pick up the slack on the chores that mattered the most to him. So for example the laundry got done, the trash went out -- but the dishes did not get done, and certainly the baseboards and floors did not get cleaned. \n\nIt may not seem fair but it is what it is. Put two people together, and they are not going to agree completely on a level of cleanliness. One will become the \"neat freak\" and the other the \"slob.\" That's how it works! You can try to meet in the middle (you work on not caring so much about crumbs while he works on caring slightly more), but this doesn't work for very long. \n\nThe best solution? Just accepting that YOU CARE ABOUT CRUMBS. So, you get to clean them. Without resentment. If he wasn't in your life, if you were a single mom, you'd be cleaning them yourself anyway, wouldn't you? And if the answer is no, then why are you cleaning them now? Go have sex instead!\n\nTL;DR: if you want the house clean, clean it yourself and let go of resentment or expectation. Unless, of course, you can afford a housecleaning service... highly recommend that, it has saved more than one marriage. \n\nAnd hang in there... it really does get better.
