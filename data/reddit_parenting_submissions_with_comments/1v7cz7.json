Texting will not solve your problems - it's not an effective means of communication.  You need to do this face-to-face.  Working full time and then coming home to hear request after request from your spouse is frustrating, just as being a SAHP feels frustrated after not getting help after your spouse walks in the door.  BOTH of you have a job, and both of you will need to discuss how to handle things. Sharing duties will be key - maybe you can alternate sleeping with the baby on the weekends.  Talk about what you do during the day (but don't present it as a list of \"look at all that I do and it's really stressful\") and just tell him that you need some time to yourself and that he needs bonding time with the kid. \n\nWhy do you sleep on an air mattress in the other room? You should sleep in your own bed. If your baby is young enough, get a rock 'n' play sleeper and put it next to your bed. Or move the baby crib/pack&amp;play into your room and put the baby there. Alternate night feedings/diaper changes with your husband. Take turns. That's what being a parent is about.\n\nAnd a thought from the opposite side of the fence - maybe he had a bad day? I work full time and only see my spouse after work, and coming home just seems like going to another job.  There's work to do and sometimes I need to defrag a bit before taking on family duties. When I have a bad day at work, it seems to spill over when I get home.

He helped me with anxiety &amp; post-partum depression issues.  He wanted to give her bottles so that I could get a break.  \n\nSomewhere around 2 1/2 months things changed.  Now, in my case, he is bipolar so I did a lot of using that as an excuse.  I felt like I was a single parent just with a roommate called my husband a lot of the time.  I think even the first lady had a slip up last year and said something about being a single mom.  I imagine a lot of women feel that way.  \n\nHe would help occasionally but not enough.  When I went back to work it got worse.  He became part zombie.  And his version of helping often meant holding her so I could poop or shower, but standing in the bathroom over me with her in hand.  \n\nOnce or twice a week he would choose to sleep on the couch so I could co-sleep with the baby b/c he refused to.  Then that became more frequent. \n\nWhen she was 6 months old after walking on eggshells for months I finally lost it and asked if he was going to leave me.  And the answer was yes.  Well it was more \"don't you see that this isn't working and how unhealthy it is for all of us.\"  \n\nI was a wreck.  But at the same time I was OK.  I knew that I now had to just take care of my baby and it would be me and her against the world now, not me and him.  Besides, I already felt like a single parent.  \n\nIt took a few months to get an apartment setup and get us moved out but from the first night in the new place, I could breathe a little better.  It sucks.  I hate that he left us.  I didn't ask for this.  But, I'm OK.  And she is doing great.  \n\nAnd he is a better father now.  He sees her a couple times a week and it is quality time.  He isn't a zombie staring at the computer while she cries in the seat next to him, he is in her playroom playing with her and her toys.  \nMaybe this is b/c she is a little bigger and more interactive. \nMaybe this is b/c he comes to my house so he doesn't have his usual distractions.  \nDoesn't matter, he is doing the best that he can.  \n\nIn some ways he helps me more too.  I don't have to worry about his bills, by which I mean he was expensive to live with.  I don't have to worry about his moods.  I get to relatively do what I want, when I want, how I want, with the baby.  In some ways being a single parent is easier.  I don't have a 40 year old child to take care of anymore.    When I need help (e.g. I need a little break to get things done around the house) I ask him to come over and watch her and as long as he is available he does.  \n\nI am not saying to leave your husband, however you may want to mentally prepare yourself in case you think that is a possibility.  You need to take stock of your feelings and your daily tasks and you need to talk to him.  \n\n- You make me feel x when you do y. \n- I really need help with our LO, here are all of the tasks I do, please take x% of them to help with.  \n\n\nGood luck and you can always PM me if you need to vent.

So, perhaps after putting the baby down for bed, or while the baby is napping, approach the topic. Tell him that you don't think he understands the amount of work that you're doing around the house, and it feels unfair. And then, listen to him as well. While I was on maternity leave, I was so jealous of my husband getting to leave the house each day while I was home with a very clingy, fussy baby. I didn't realize that he was very stressed at work as well, and felt jealous of me being home all day. So, we both needed to work to see the other person's challenges and feelings.\nI would also have an idea of some specific things or \"buckets of work\" that you could use help with. So, can he be in charge of dinner two days per week, or in charge of grocery shopping, or walking the dogs, or bathtime during the week, or whatever it is. If he refuses to commit to anything, I think he needs to spend some understanding how difficult it is to be the primary caretaker and manager of the home. Tell him you want him to watch the baby for one full day while you are out. Hopefully that will give him an appreciation of how hard you are working and how it's only fair that you get some help.\nThe sleep thing is tough. Honestly, I just don't think men are as tough as women when it comes to sleep deprivation. They're convinced they are entitled to a solid night's sleep and us women know that just is not happening with a young baby in the house. What my husband and I did is that I would sleep with the baby downstairs most nights and then he would come down at 5:30am and be in charge of baby for 2 hours while I slept. Sometimes baby slept during that time, sometimes not. Either way, I got to start the day with a solid nap. And then, he would also take over occassional nights on the weekend. But, we would discuss that in advance. So, during your calm talk about needing more help around the house, ask if he could commit to one night per week of being in charge of the baby (or whatever arrangement you come up with). \n", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1389729118, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "cepi6oz", "link_id": "t3_1v7cz7", "parent_id": "t3_1v7cz7", "removal_reason": null, "retrieved_on": 1431941223, "score": 5, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"archived": true, "author": "mrsamazing12", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "I only texted he m because i was feeding the baby and its quiet Lol a text can't wake her.

Don't belittle or let him make light of you staying home.  It really is a lot of physical and mental energy to be a stay-at-home parent.  He does need to understand and to help out more.  Having a kid is a lot more work than having a dog, but it's harder for men to understand because they kind of take a backseat for the pregnancy/birth.  So suddenly they come into a lot of responsibilities rather quickly, and it takes time to adjust.  But let me reiterate - communication! Be honest with each other.

Wait for a time when both of you are relatively calm or else it could be doomed from the start.

First off, the situation as it is currently is obviously unacceptable.  I have to ask you a serious question though:  Do you consider / treat your husband as an equal (a 2nd parent,) or an assistant to you.  Is he involved in the decisions that go into the child's upbringing (i.e. the methods used in parenting, sleep training, etc...,) or do you decide and dictate and then expect him to fall in line?  \n  \nI see that you are sleeping with the child every night.  Is this attachment parenting?  Is this a decision that your husband was a part of or had a say in?  \n  \nI'm being serious.  I recognize his attitude.  It's the attitude of \"oh, now you want something from me?\" and \"Seriously?  You've got to be kidding.\"  \n  \nThe bottle thing seems unreasonable on his part, so I have to assume he's just checked out as a parent, or he never wanted to be one.  Hopefully it is the former and a situation that can be fixed.  There's not much of a fix if he never wanted kids.  \n  \nHow does he feel about the situation of the child sleeping with mom every night?  Was he for it?  Why is this the case?  How did it develop?  Was this your doing and did he have any say in it (this form of sleep training?)   Is it possible you're asking him to take a night dealing with the situation you created outside of his control / input that he never wanted to exist in the first place?  \n  \nI work full time and my wife stays home, and the way it worked for us is that for the week I took off with the birth, I did basically everything except whip out my moob as she recovered.  After that time period, when I went back to work, I get up during the night with the kids on the weekends.  That is what works for us.  \n  \nWe are both parents.  If I decide that something needs to happen, she backs me up.  Same with the other direction.  There are times, for example, when I tell her \"we need to let him cry it out a bit before we go reset/comfort him\" and we agree on a time and then move forward as a team.  We are very determined at sleep training and ensuring that the kids could self sooth and deal with being in the crib.  I would never agree to a nightly routine that involved her sleeping with the baby, and my wife would never go against my wishes in that department.  If she did, I have to say, I would be very \"yeah right\" if I was then asked to sleep with the child on my nights.\n\nNow, I may be barking up the wrong tree here\u2014partially, or completely, but the fact remains that he either is checked out as a parent for some reason, or never wanted to be one.  I hope he wanted to be a parent, and that you figure out whatever is causing this behavior.\n\n", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1389836519, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "ceqnrih", "link_id": "t3_1v7cz7", "parent_id": "t3_1v7cz7", "removal_reason": null, "retrieved_on": 1431961254, "score": 3, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"archived": true, "author": "dstam", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "Yeah, sorry I wasn't really talking about you in particular.
