I've tried everything in my power to help her lose the weight but she doesn't seem to be getting any smaller. \nSome back story. When she was born she was only 6'7 which I'm told is on the small side. She had a few months where she would only fall asleep if I was in the bed with her feeding her a bottle and it usually took a few small bottles to get her to sleep. I indulged her because I was sleep deprived myself and had a pretty severe case of the baby blues. I'm fully aware that wasn't the right thing to do but hindsight is always 20/20. I stopped over feeding her as soon as I realized how bad it got. \nWe've had genetic tests, thyroid tests and such and everything was negative. I've tried feeding her less, feeding her 3 medium sized meals a day with no snacks, feeding her 6 small meals a day, feeding her 3 meals that always followed a pattern (fruit for breakfast, fruit and veggie for lunch, protein and veggie for dinner) and more other ways than I can list. She only drinks skim milk, crystal light, or water. Everything she eats is low fat, fat free, sugar free, or low calorie (though we occasionally give her a piece of chocolate or cookie when she's had a bad day). She plays outside every day and does physical therapy for something unrelated so she gets plenty of exercise. I'm out of ideas and I'm worried for my daughters health. \nSorry for the wall of text. I'm just at my wits end and would be extremely appreciative of any input you moms may have. \n\nWow thank you for all the advice! I didn't expect nearly this much.

Hey, it happens.  But the fact that you care and are trying to make healthy changes speaks volumes.\n\nHere's a problem I see:  you don't want to make her smaller!  Your goal should be to slow down her weight gain until it evens out with her height.  Give it plenty of time.  You can chart her on the growth chart occasionally to see if her BMI percentile is improving.  You need to look into her serving sizes for a child of her age, and how much of each food group she needs.\n\nI feel her meal pattern is very limited.  1) only fruit for breakfast?  You are giving her carbs, but nothing with protein to help sustain and even out that rise in blood sugars.  This can easily lead to her feeling hungry very soon after.  2) Fruit and veggie for lunch.  Same thing.  Add a little protein here. Keep in mind, there is such a thing as eating too little.  It's a fine line.  But not eating enough will cause her body to hold onto everything she eats. \n\nLimit her milk intake to meal times, maybe 4 oz servings.  Water the rest of the day.  If she wants flavor, try infusing the water with fresh fruits.  Snacks can be fruits and veggies.  I'm not too restrictive on fat free/sugar free things, but they do say that they can cause you to crave even more sweet stuff.  \n\nThe fact that her doctor tried limiting her formula worries me.  Infants should never never be put on a diet.  Also the fact that the doctor wants her lost weight also worries me.  I'm not a fan of this doctor.  Give your little girl time to adjust to healthy eating, give her body time to change, and don't expect her to lose weight.

Someone commented asking if the parent of an obese child is considered abusive and everyone said yes. I went on a rant and decided to post. I know she isn't obese but I definitely think she's a lot heavier than she should be. I just want to get a handle on it before she actually does become obese.

If I were in your position I'd want as many very specific meal ideas as possible. Here is our meal schedule:\n\nBreakfast starts with scrambled eggs. My 15mo usually eats a little less than 2 eggs. They are scrambled in olive oil with nothing else. When we have greens in the garden e also gets those (chard, kale, etc., saut\u00e9ed quickly in a bit of olive oil and a tiny bit of salt and pepper). He loves greens. After he has eaten most of them, I offer blueberries, strawberries, or raspberries. Occasionally a banana, but I limit them (tons of sugar). Water with the meal. Occasionally I give him a heel of crusty bread if he is teething.\n\nWater offered throughout the day. No juice.\n\nLunch at 11 is usually leftovers from the night before. \n\n4oz whole milk before naptime.\n\nHalf banana, apple, or something else from daycare for afternoon snack, and a 4 oz bottle of milk.\n\nDinner is always a meat and a veggie. Many nights we also have a grain or bread. If not, I try to make sure we have a starchy veggie like potato or sweet potato.\n \nMeat list: steak, ground beef with some seasoning, roasted chicken, chicken salad, trout, salmon, pork chops, and sometimes lamb.\n\nVeggie list: chard, kale, collards, broccoli, peas, corn (limited), sweet potatoes (ideal!), avocado, guacamole, eggplants saut\u00e9ed with tomatoes, cucumbers with onion and vinegar,  artichokes (he doesn't eat these well, so limited), Brussels sprouts, asparagus, portobello caps. \n\nGrains: white or brown or wild rice, quinoa cooked in bone broth (heavenly. We make the broth from the roasted chicken carcasses), couscous. \n\nI think this is probably a non-issue but we always let him feed himself (from 6mo), always offer lots of water, and basically feed him what we eat. Occasionally when we eat a pizza, he gets chicken nuggets and canned peas (the nuggets from Costco are actually pretty good). \n\nOur diet is very simple (dishes are usually very quick), and almost nothing we eat is packaged. If you want recipes for anything, I'd be happy to help.\n\nGood luck mama!\n\n\n", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1371214435, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "cair3s8", "link_id": "t3_1g4xbo", "parent_id": "t3_1g4xbo", "retrieved_on": 1430812456, "score": 2, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"archived": true, "author": "starsweeper", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "Thanks! Even more great suggestions. I know she likes a few of the things you mentioned and we'll be trying out different types of veggies and proteins to see what she likes.

Sometimes sticking something in the microwave for 90 seconds is just quick and easy but I'm thinking of starting to make healthy things in large batches and just stick them in the fridge.
