It began about 6 months ago with him touching my hair and saying that he too wanted long hair and wearing towels and scarves on top of his head to mimic longer hair. I thought it was cute and certainly didn't discourage it - I often helped him create a little \"up-do\" or tie the scarf in a ponytail.\n\nSince then, he has become increasingly interested in princesses and dresses. I bought him a Moana dress - which he loved and never ever wanted to take off - and I've since bought him a \"normal\" simple girly dress from Target. Every time we let him wear it, his eyes light up and I swear he gets this quiet confidence and just swells with pride when he sees himself in it in the mirror. He will say \"look! I'm so beautiful!\" Or \"I am a princess\" or even \"I am a girl!\" This is usually quite adorable but at the same time I never thought about how I would react or parent a child who enjoyed traditionally opposite-gendered clothing. When he's not in his own dresses, he is begging to wear one of my shirts (long enough to be a dress on him) and screams for hours if I have to take off his dress to wash it.\n\nWe have taken him out to the park and library in his dress and he has a blast. We've gotten a few people asking how old \"she\" is, etc and I just answer and don't really correct them or go on about it. He has a fairly masculine name and an older brother so I'm sure when I refer to them as brothers or call him by name it can be confusing.\n\nI haven't been able to talk about this much - my husband is kind of uncomfortable with it but isn't banning it - he's just kind of letting me take the reigns.\n\nAnyone else's boy kiddo into dresses? Or vice versa? I love my son whether he remains my son or eventually becomes my daughter, I just want to parent him in these early years the best that I can. Should I overhaul his wardrobe to that of girlier fashions? Save the dresses for special occasions? Let him wear dresses as long as they are strictly \"costumes\" (husband's idea)? Encourage it when he says he's a princess or girl? Am I just totally overthinking this because he's only 2 and still poops in a diaper and barely knows his middle name!? Haha any advice would be helpful , with the exception of hateful, angry or transphobic advice of course!

Dressing up out in public is another thing. Understand that he is 2 and doesn\u2019t have the concept of gender or identity yet.

A mom friend of mine got excited and encouraged her child down this path when years later the child ended up wanting to be the sex they were born with but had a very difficult time readjusting. Kids at school were very confused because they had seen the child as 2 different genders and tormented the kid until they had to switch schools twice. The kid is now in the phase where they are angry with the mom with letting them dress up at school. The child is angry with themselves and now wares all black and locks themselves in their room. Moving schools and readjusting has been very hard on the family. I know the mom regrets it. My friend and her husband have fought a lot about it and I know it\u2019s hurt thief marriage. I\u2019m not saying this is going to happen to you and I know that there are families where transitioning is the RIGHT choice. I just want to share my friends experience with you so you know what she is still going through.

After seeing what my friend has gone through I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to let your small toddler decide their own gender. I remember for years I was a Tom boy and my mom always told me I might as well have been a boy because i never wanted to ware dresses. My boy cousin used to play dress up with his sisters and now he\u2019s a grown married man. I think dressing as the opposite sex and feeling like you want to be something else is normal in children and just apart of finding yourself.

Until kids hit puberty, any gendered things are purely cosmetic (clothing, hair, name), and can all be changed as the child changes. \n\nI personally would discourage the \u201ccostume\u201d idea, because that makes it seem like it\u2019s only okay for play or as a joke (and the \u201cguy in a dress\u201d trope is very harmful to trans people).

People often thought they were a boy/girl twin set. My friend always corrected people who referred to Jordan as a boy. As the twins got older, Jordan got bullied a lot for not being girlie. She had Harry Potter birthday parties instead of Disney princess themes. Eventually Jordan came home crying one day and told her mom she didn\u2019t feel like she was born a girl. That she felt like she was the wrong gender and desperately wanted to be a boy, she was 7. My friend just told her daughter she could be whatever she wanted to be. My friend supported her, they talked for hours about what it meant to be a \u201cboy\u201d. Eventually they left the conversation with an agreement to return to it anytime Jordan wanted. The twins are now young adults and for the most part, nothing has changed. Riley is still really girly.

We just let him take the lead, don\u2019t encourage or discourage but let him know it\u2019s okay if he chooses. Honestly only little girls on the playground have said anything about the dress or his painted toenails. Like \u201cwhy is he wearing a dress if he\u2019s a boy?\u201d  We just say because he wanted to, smile, and leave it at that. He has short hair (because he doesn\u2019t want to brush it and kept getting knots so we cut it with his agreement). Otherwise he seems happy being a boy and enjoys \u201cboy\u201d activities so we\u2019ll see, don\u2019t worry about it! A few boys in our town I\u2019ve seen around the Y or playground also wear dresses, it\u2019s normal :)", "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "created_utc": 1559334323, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "gildings": {}, "id": "epnw1ev", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_bv2925", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_bv2925", "permalink": "/r/Mommit/comments/bv2925/2_year_old_boy_obsessed_with_wearing_dresses/epnw1ev/", "retrieved_on": 1559334333, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3", "total_awards_received": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "approved_at_utc": null, "author": "Jinjit23", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_ibps9", "author_patreon_flair": false, "banned_at_utc": null, "body": "Someone I know had a little boy who was the same.

He's suddenly swapped and is now into dinosaurs. For him, it was just a phase. He was allowed to do what he wanted and after years of doing it, he decided he wasn't interested anymore.
