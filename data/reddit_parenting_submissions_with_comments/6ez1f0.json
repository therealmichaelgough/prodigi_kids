The gas bubbles are fairly painless if you get them out early, but if you don't and they go through the digestive system they will become farts which seem to be a lot more difficult and painful for the baby to pass. Breastfeeding causes less bubbles, but they're still totally going to happen (I thought it wouldn't for the first few days so I didn't burp my poor baby \ud83d\ude22).
