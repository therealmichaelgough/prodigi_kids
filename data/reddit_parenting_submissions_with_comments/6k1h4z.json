So that helps a bunch too. \n\nAnything else goes on credit cards as an emergency,  and gets paid off slowly when we can pay on it other than the min payment. \n\nIt's tough and I'm so ready to have my son in daycare.

Otherwise I'd be at home pulling my hair out while he tantrums and cries. \n\nThat's how we manage for now\n", "can_gild": true, "created_utc": 1498686497, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "djj41d8", "link_id": "t3_6k1h4z", "parent_id": "t3_6k1h4z", "retrieved_on": 1498686497, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"author": "Nonamer94", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "We already shop @ Aldo &amp; we love it!!

I made more money than my husband, but always knew I wanted my kids to grow up with me as their primary caretaker. Before I quit, we built up our savings. I really wish we had just lived on my husband's paycheck and saved mine to prepare, but we weren't that disciplined. Now, we try to follow Dave Ramsey's principles and try to be frugal. I'm not big into clothes shopping, so that helps. The area where I tend to overspend is FOOD...I love grocery shopping. I use an app that allows me to divide my money into electronic \"envelopes\" and I love it. It motivates me to save, even if it's just a little here and there, so that I can get some of the extras that I miss from when I worked outside the home. I do make extra money on the side with some of my personal hobbies and skills. It's not much, but gives me some extra money to spend or save.\n\nWhen I was working full time, we ate out a ton, so now we save with me being able to cook most of the time. I would also spend money on coffees, cupcakes, treats to bring to work and all kinds of things that I can just make myself at home for much cheaper. We save on gas because my job was 30 minutes from home. I find I save more on my purchases because I have more time to shop around and check out prices at different stores, whereas when I was working, if we wanted something, we wanted it NOW and did not have time to go to multiple stores. I plan to start gardening as well to save on produce. All of these are little things, but they do add up.\n\nThe most burdensome part about being frugal to me is feeling restricted socially. I want to still maintain relationships with friends, and most of the time that involves going out for food or drinks. I still try to make it out of the house regularly for my sanity, but now I look for more free things to do. There are plenty of free activities in the city I've been able to do with friends instead of spending a ton on drinks or dinner. Or I invite people for a home cooked meal or movie night.\n\nIn general, I have tried to change my mindset to be more of a producer and less of a consumer however I can. I now contribute to our household by finding ways to save us money, rather than making money. Reuse items, fix things rather than throwing them out and buying a new one...It's a total lifestyle change for me.

I always worked and stopped a few weeks before having the baby and do not plan to return until him and any other children are in school and even then it will only be part time if/when I do. My husband has busted his butt and we moved for his job when it merged with another company because he loves what he does. He makes a fairly nice salary that we can afford our home our bills and work on savings. I make sure to look for coupons and deals while grocery shopping and because of this I'm not limited to what I should be buying. Any extra purchases we talk about. If he wants a game or something for the house we talk about it and look for the best price on the item and buy it as cheaply as we can. Since our son is only 3.5 months I'm home a lot with him, which saves money on gas. I look for free things to take him to, like story time at the local library or walking around the local mall. When he's older we plan to buy annual passes to the zoo so I can take him there and teach him about my passion which is animals. \n\nSo for us is we set these goals years ago, and worked very hard to achieve them. We used birth control to help prevent pregnancy before we were ready and when we were we sat down and looked at everything and realized we were. We are now looking into more money saving things like downgrading our cable and adjusting our phone plans.

I took that position 3 years ago and I got a good raise and promotion within a year - better and faster results than I ever had working full time!

We have now depleted our savings and although we can afford the necessities on our current income, we don't have enough income to handle any of life's little curveballs thrown at us, or to have nice things.  I think my advice would be to stick to a budget, work part time if/when you can and remember you'll go back to full time eventually.
