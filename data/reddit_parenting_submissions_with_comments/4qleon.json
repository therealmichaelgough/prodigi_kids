So circumcism and ear piercings are both \"no\" in my book because they are cosmetic. Vaccines are a \"yes\" because they save lives. Does that make sense? \n\nYou may want to do a quick search or circumcism over in /r/nursing. There was a huge thread over there about nurses that have taken part in circumcisms and the stories are not pretty. If you are going to circumcise, I think you need to watch a video of one being done so that you will know exactly what is happening to your son. It is too easy to think \"oh the baby leaves and comes back not crying and it's a minor procedure\" and once you really start to research it, watch a video of the procedure, and all that jazz you realize the baby isnt crying because he is in shock. I think it's terrible that parents circumcise their children without being willing to see firsthand what is happening to their sons. Knowledge is power.\n\nAlso, if it matters, I much prefer uncircumcised penis and my husband is circumcised. In my experience, I've had two uncircumcised partners that have struggled with sexual dysfunction (not being able to get off within a reasonable amount of time) and I think that has to do with the tip of the circumcised penis being less sensitive to sexual stimuli because is is always exposed. You can Google it and sexual dysfunction is more prevalent in circumcised males. Also, the uncircumcised penis feels better (smoother?) when having sex.

My older younger brother had to have a few surgeries to \"fix\" a poorly done circumcision. I am only 1-2 years older than he is, so my memory isn't the best. I remember being older and asking why he had to go away and my dad told me he couldn't pee straight.

I figured when he was an adult if he wanted to be circumcised he could make that choice for himself.\n\nFast forward about a year after his third heart surgery, he had been having ongoing irritation caused by his foreskin only partially retracting. Poor guy was red, swollen and in pain for months even though we cleaned him and took care of his penis as recommended and we were told it should clear up in a few weeks of this regimen. We opted to have the circumcision done at that point. He was PISSED post-op, but once he fully recovered (which took much longer than it does for infants) he's been pain and irritation free, and happy. If I ever have another boy I will go for the circumcision at birth, it seems to be much less traumatic than for older children. I've also heard it's even worse once you reach adulthood.\n\nThat's just my personal experience, and it's a very personal decision for you and your wife to make.
