I recently read a study saying no screen time until 12! And apparently since Steve Jobs didn't let his kids play with tablets, we shouldn't either?\n\nMy kid is 19 months and plays on a tablet for 1/2 hour every morning and up to an hour at night. Maybe I'm letting him play on it too much. But it's absolutely amazing to watch him and his brain at work. He knows which apps are \"his\" although he also likes the cat games (from my furbaby stage) and music apps. \n\nHe is learning letters and numbers from his favorite games, Endless ABC/123/Reader. He can put together math problems incredibly fast - and although it's just pattern recognition, I think it may give him a leg up when we're doing actual math. \n\nHe knows how to turn the iPad on, change the volume, force quit apps, skip songs, call mommy at work for a video chat, etc. As a kid who will grow up with screens being the basis of both school/work and home life, this native understanding of the platform seems invaluable. \n\nHe has learned a variety of songs. He talks a lot but we're not sure what he's saying most of the time but he's learning the words to his favorite songs which helps us understand words he says in other contexts. \n\nHe is still playful, friendly and active. My only concern is that he doesn't seem to have much of an interest in books unless we're just using the book to quiz him. He is impatient but I think that's just an attribute of being almost 2. \n\nI am so passionately for screen time that I feel like a rabid anti-vaxxer who ignores science and goes with their own anecdotes as evidence. But the science seems so incredibly flawed (and all of it seems to be based on just setting your kid in front of the platform and ignoring them).
