Safe but really lightweight car seat. I got a Graco Snugride snuglock with stroller attachment. Pretty easy to get in and out of cars. With that being said I would highly recommend before buying one to take a car seat class. After getting one, install it and have the installation checked at a the fire station if they do that in your area. Sometimes birthing centers also have car seat clinics where you can have them check it for proper installation. \n2. Extra bases for said car seat for multiple cars. I have one in my car, my husband has one and we have 1 spare for grandma or aunts in case we\u2019re in a rush. \n4. Sleep sacks or footie pajamas. I love targets footies because they Zip from top to bottom instead of bottom to top. Makes midnight diaper changes easier. \n5. Dr.Browns slow flow bottles for at first. I thought all\nBottles were created equal and had no idea they had different flows. He was choking on milk. I got 3 packs of Dr.Browns at TJMaxx and Marshall\u2019s for $10 (usually $18 on amazon or at target).\n6. Pumping bra. This has changed my life. I pump on one side and breastfeed on the other. This allows hands free pumping. I don\u2019t know how I was surviving before it. I got mine on amazon for $20.\n7. An extra set of flanges and bottles for pumping. Mine are dishwasher safe so it makes pumping easier to throw a set in the dishwasher and still have an extra. I\u2019m sure it will save me when I go back to work as well. \n8. Milk bags. I go through roughly 100 bags a week. I didn\u2019t buy any as I didn\u2019t think I would produce much more than he would need. I do. Much much more.\n9. Depends for the first few weeks. Lots of bleeding. Higher probability of peeing your pants. I had a c section and having the high waisted ones was a life saver to prevent any seams rubbing on my incision and they were much more comfy than the nylon bullshit with the maxi pads they give you at the hospital. \n\nIf I think of more I\u2019ll edit and add. :)", "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "created_utc": 1562492295, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "gildings": {}, "id": "et5vkd9", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_ca2ixs", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_ca2ixs", "permalink": "/r/Mommit/comments/ca2ixs/what_stuff_do_i_need/et5vkd9/", "retrieved_on": 1562492295, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3", "total_awards_received": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "approved_at_utc": null, "author": "in--visible", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_cel4wui", "author_patreon_flair": false, "banned_at_utc": null, "body": "Burp cloths and bibs.

Food - if you want to breastfeed you'll want breastfeeding accessories such as breast pads or maybe a good book on breastfeeding. Your insurance should cover one free breast pump so find out what is covered before deciding if you want to add it to the registry. If you want to/have to formula feed them you'll want formula (it's expensive) but as you'll find, your baby may be very sensitive to formula (or not). This is where gift cards to Amazon/Target come in handy. A boppy pillow to help hold baby during feedings might be nice, too. \n\n2. Sleep - whatever your situation is (from having a room for a nursery to having a corner of your bedroom) there are safe sleep solutions that fit everyone's lifestyle and budget. Small bassinets to full cribs. Just remember that your baby can't/shouldn't have a bumper or comforter/blanket or basically anything but them inside their crib for the first year to reduce the risk of SIDS. So don't get too hung up on the perfect baby bedding set. \n\n3. Diapers - there are quite a few options. I've tried several of them and honestly I recommend you do too. We've settled on Costco brand, Kirkland, because you can't beat the price (we tend to stock up when they're on sale). Also Kirkland diapers are literally Pampers with different branding. I love the honest company diapers and they're so cute but really no one ever sees the diapers and the price adds up. Target brand is pretty good but my kid had an allergic reaction/insane diaper rash from them. For a while we used diapers.com but they got purchased by Amazon and the service went down while the price went up. There are also cloth diapers. I haven't used them but there's a million resources online about them. Also, a diaper bag. \n\n4. Transportation - again, depending on your living situation you're going to want different types of travel gear. If you drive, a car seat. If you live in a city and don't drive much then a stroller. And either way you may want a carrier or sling, or wrap. There are individual strollers and car seats and ones that can work together as a travel system. With my first I got independent car seat from stroller and spent many hours of my life letting my kid sleep in the car. With my second I have a travel system because I don't want to sit in the car. \n\nIf you go to the Buy-Buy Baby, Babylist, Amazon, or Target registry system online it gives you a checklist of what you might want (and popular suggestions). I've liked the Amazon registry best because their suggestions are based on purchases and they're fat less expensive than Buy-Buy Baby. \n\nImportant honorable mentions:\n\n- child grooming kit\n- forehead thermometer/scanner\n- bottles (Babylist has a bottle sample box) \n- a rocker/swing\n- swaddle blankets/burp cloths\n- diaper disposal system\n\nNow you get to decide what your situation calls for. Do you want a full blown nursery with a theme and everything? Do you only have space for a small basinet? Do you want to breastfeed? Can you? Will you go back to work (and therefore need to pump)? What kind of transportation requirements do you have? Etc. \n\nIt's nice when family wants to pitch in on larger items like a crib/basinet or travel system/car seat. If you don't feel comfortable asking for big ticket items like that then ask for diapers (and not just new born sizes) or other essentials you'll be going through a lot. \n\nA baby shower is also a great time to ask for baby books to start a baby library. I strongly suggest: the very hungry caterpillar, everyday babies, an abc book, the quiet book, a faces book (high contrast images), the giving tree, etc. Amazon has a top 100 baby books that makes this very easy. We asked for books instead of cards so now my first kid has some sweet inscriptions from family in her baby books. \n\nI really enjoyed \"Bringing Up B\u00e9b\u00e9\" as a parenting book and recommend it a lot but there are a ton of books on parenting if you're so inclined. \n\nFinally, my personal advice is to look into a children's consignment store near you. Cribs and strollers and clothes and diaper bags are all reusable and buying second-hand reduces waste.  (Just don't buy car seats second hand). \n\nI hope this helps. I'm happy to make specific suggestions on brand and carrots choices we made if you're interested. \n\nGood luck!!", "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "created_utc": 1562500873, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "gildings": {}, "id": "et61hsq", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_ca2ixs", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_ca2ixs", "permalink": "/r/Mommit/comments/ca2ixs/what_stuff_do_i_need/et61hsq/", "retrieved_on": 1562500883, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3", "total_awards_received": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "approved_at_utc": null, "author": "Gone-Postal-Narwhal", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_85net", "author_patreon_flair": false, "banned_at_utc": null, "body": "Nose Frida instead of bulb when they are sick.

I literally just used the flannel recieving blankets because they get puked on anyways and it worked for me. Trust that you will need something handy, at all times, to clean spit up. \n\n3. Diapers. Stock up on newborn and size 1 and 2 diapers because nothing sucks more than a midnight trip to the nearest open store with a cranky baby in a wet diaper. \n\n4. This varies by baby but I found that my guys really enjoyed their baby swing that played music. \n\nAnd now, some things that I found out I didn't really need at all:\n\n1. Baby wash cloths. They are so tiny that they get lost easily/destroyed in the washing machine and I found more success using a regular (new) bath pouf. Same goes with baby towels. Just use your regular ol' clean towels.\n\n2. Baby bath tub that goes inside regular tub/sink. Kinda cute but totally unneccessary and hard to store in a small bathroom. \n\n3. Bassinet. You're better off just having a crib from the jump. They will quickly outgrow the bassinet and then you're stuck with another piece of baby gear that you cant use and is hard to store. \n\n\nHope this helped! :) Congrats and good luck new momma!", "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "created_utc": 1562501326, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "gildings": {}, "id": "et61yel", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_ca2ixs", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_ca2ixs", "permalink": "/r/Mommit/comments/ca2ixs/what_stuff_do_i_need/et61yel/", "retrieved_on": 1562501336, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3", "total_awards_received": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "approved_at_utc": null, "author": "lared1980", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2leg21p0", "author_patreon_flair": false, "banned_at_utc": null, "body": "Check out the site Lucies list she makes really good lists and reviews of everything you need for every stage including what to register for for a shower.

Not a baby item but I swear they are so absobent and work for a trillion things. Cloth diapering, breast milk leakage, under you and baby during night nursing, the uses are unlimited I swear! \n\n\n\u00b0Ice packs for the engorgement days \n\n\n\u00b0 Spectra S2 or S1 are great gentle breast pumps. The S1 is rechargeable and portable. I use the Spectra and got attatchments from Amazon that allows me to use Medela parts. The Medela parts are much more comfortable and easier to find and use with a pumping bra. \n\n\n\u00b0Milk storage bags. My favorite as an overproducer are the Parents Choice brand. They never leak (for me) they feel like they are higher quality and they are way more affordable than other options.

Look up Quinee Nursing dresses! They're amazing! \n\n\n\u00b0 Target gift cards. Girl you will want to get out at some point. And the best place is somewhere with a Starbucks and a comfy spot to feed the baby if they get hungry. And you can shop for you and baby. \n\n\n\u00b0I'm obsessed with the Lillebaby Tie the Knot wrap.
