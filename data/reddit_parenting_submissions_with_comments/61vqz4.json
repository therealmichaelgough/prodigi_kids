So far, we love our daycare, but we are a bit concerned about the food they are serving. When we first started there, they asked for a list of food restrictions. As she was under a year, we listed that salt and sugar be avoided as much as possible and stated that we are happy to send in homemade substitutes when necessary. They assured us that they never include sugar or salt in the food that they provide. We're not completely opposed to a tiny bit of salt or sugar, but also don't want her eating junk as a baby. Recently, we have noticed that they have started serving her more and more food with excess amounts of sugar. Today they told me that they gave her the canned fruit salad that is in the sugar syrup. Before that, they have given her cookies (not the baby kind) and flavoured yogurt. Let me say that I am not completely anti-sugar and will happily let her have some treats once she is a bit older, but I feel like this is unnecessary for an infant. Just wanted to get other moms opinions on this and see if I'm being irrational.
