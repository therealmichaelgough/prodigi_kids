If you can clearly see the car, the weather is mild (45-65) with no sun shining right on the vehicle, and you'll be in &amp; out (like a convenience store), no sense in going through the hassle of bringing the child out of the car. That said, for a quick trip to the bathroom, it's iffier, but the likelihood of anything detrimental actually happening is extremely low. I suppose just in case, the parent could put a little note in the window with the time of exit, that they are in the bathroom and maybe even a phone a number if the paranoia is there. I understand the fear that people have, and especially in frigid or temperatures over 70, but if we're talking less than 5 minutes? It's frankly ridiculous the level of fear perpetuated versus looking science and statistics. Obviously if there is a chance you'll be longer than that, don't risk it, but there are definitely situations where a parent shouldn't be vilified for leaving their child in the car for a few minutes.

We have a high number of hot car deaths, so I can see this happening, especially since it's legal to break someone's car window if you think their dog is too hot.
