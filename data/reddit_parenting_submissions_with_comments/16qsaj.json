And then I thought I was done after I had my second child (he's almost 7 now). I thought I was definitely done after I had my third (he's 5 now) especially since we had just gotten a diagnosis of pervasive developmental delay on his older brother. Not to mention two babies exactly 18 months apart and a toddler was wearing me down fast. \n\nAnd then the birth control failed and I swore I was never having another one after I had my second daughter (3 years old now). And I had a tubal ligation. Which failed. And I had baby number 5, who required some hardcore surgery within a day of his birth. And I swore I would never put myself through that, to say nothing of putting another child through that. He's a year old now and doing pretty well. So I had the tubal ligation repeated, by another doctor. \n\nIt failed again and I had two miscarriages, exactly 90 days apart. I sort of lost my mind for a couple months after that. When I pulled myself back from the edge of that abyss, I decided that if the ligation wouldn't work, fine, I was going back on the pill, and my husband was going to wear a condom, like it or be celibate, I was done. Emotionally, physically and mentally. \nAt this point, I was mom to five kids, one with autism, one with asthma and one that has rather significant stomach issues, as well as stepmom to 2 wonderful little boys, who are both on the autism spectrum. \n\nAnd then the condom broke while I was taking the pill and amoxicillin. I'm due in June. And I have learned to laugh about it. I said I was done after the first one. I'm now on my 8th pregnancy, and have 7 children I'm responsible for. If we win the custody battle for my stepson and I make it through to delivery with this baby, by next summer, I will have a 10 year old, an 8 year old, a 7 year old, a 6 year old, a 4 year old, a 2 year old, and a newborn. \n\nAnd I'm okay with that. I would have been okay with only 1, or only 2. \n\nThe point is that for each person, it's different. I was my mother's only child, and I am thankful for that. She couldn't raise me, let alone me and another child. There's no need to make a decision right now, and weighing the pros and cons will only drive you nuts. And sometimes, like in my case, it won't matter what decision you make, nature will override it, forcing you to make new decisions, all with their own sets of pros and cons. \n\nBeing on the fence is a fine place to be. Stay there as long as you want. Just, trust me, if you make the decision to use the pill to stop yourself from getting pregnant, just abstain if you have to take an antibiotic at the same time :)\n\n", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1358479343, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "c7yyryk", "link_id": "t3_16qsaj", "parent_id": "t3_16qsaj", "retrieved_on": 1430998751, "score": 3, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "Mommit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3i3"}, {"archived": true, "author": "ibormeith", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "Honestly, you don't need to worry about it right now.
