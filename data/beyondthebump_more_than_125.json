            "selftext": "I\u2019m so over unsolicited advice.\n\nI posted a cute picture of my 3 month old. He had grabbed his bottle from me (we\u2019re learning to grab stuff) and fell asleep grasping it right (not eating it, it was actually empty). It was hilarious and adorable. I used #formulafed. Anyways, I got a message from a now-unfriendly individual who sent me a bunch of breastfeeding propaganda. And I mean, propaganda. No real sources or scientifically presented data. We\u2019re talking memes and Facebook posts from anti-science Facebook pages along with the message: \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why you think it\u2019s cute to post pics of [son] with a bottle. You should be ashamed you aren\u2019t providing your child with the best thing for him: your liquid gold.\u201d\n\nMy response: \u201cWell, he\u2019s a little too young for melted cheese and breastfeeding just didn\u2019t work out for us. Don\u2019t send stuff like this again please.\u201d\n\nFrom that point, it was a parade of messages stating I clearly didn\u2019t accept that I was failing my kid and he\u2019d be malnourished (HAHAHAHA yeah 89th percentile for height and 60th for weight, totally malnourished) and we\u2019d never have the same bond she had with her kids because I wouldn\u2019t give him free reign of my boobs. \n\nUnfriended. Blocked. Nope. \n\nJust because something works for YOU as a mom doesn\u2019t mean it did for us. I refuse to be bullied into guilty for giving my son formula after pumping made me suicidal to the point my psychiatrist almost had me involuntarily committed unless I stopped. \n\nI\u2019m so over the mommy competition. I\u2019m so over comparing \u201cjourneys\u201d and acting like one is superior. You don\u2019t know my kid like I do. I don\u2019t know yours. You need me to stand guard from bullies so you can nurse? You bet your ass I will. I need some help making a bottle? I\u2019m gonna ask. You want to wear your child through a store. Awesome! My son prefers the stroller. Sweet. That gives us more storage if we go shopping and you\u2019ll have free hands. You don\u2019t want to sleep train? You do you. But we are going to under the direction of a doctor and you know that\u2019s what we need to do. \n\nThat\u2019s what we need. Being a mom is too hard already without other moms tearing each other down. This was such a moment for me of just unbelievable sadness. I couldn\u2019t even imagine thinking this was okay. Freak, I\u2019m sending a friend a breastfeeding kit (water bottle, breast pads, nipple cream, and an audible gift card) so she can be set up to try to do what she wants. \n\nI\u2019m begging you. Unless CPS is warranted (true filth, actual abuse, starving their child, etc.), bug off and just let moms mom their child the way that\u2019s best for their family. \n\nRant over.",

I had a very difficult 36 hour induction which led to an ER C-section. \n\nBaby girl was born with minor respitory issues and was rushed to NICU. It was 8 hours before I got to see her. It was the longest 8 hours of my fucking life. She was stable enough to spend the night in our room.\n\nDay 2, baby girl develops hypoglycemia and is rushed to NICU because glucose is 24. We then learn she has jaundice. \n\nDay 5, we discharge. Thinking this is all in the past. \n\nDay 7, pediatrician thinks jaundice is not resolved. End up in hospital for two days.\n\nDay 9, we are home and guess what? I don't want any fucking visitors. Like at all. It's tiring as fuck to have people over. Even if they are helpful. I can't get baby girl to latch despite 5 different lactation consultants. I have settled with pumping but it is very tiresome. Her sleep schedule is wake up every two or four hours to eat. Y'all know how tiresome this is.\n\nI've been getting a lot of messages about coming visit and people catching an attitude that I don't want visitors. You, especially if you are not immediate or really \"close,\" are not entitled to see the baby!!! You literally have no part of this. You are just a bystander who have never been there for me and you just want to come hold a baby. \n\nDon't catch an attitude with me. This week has been fucking hell and I am not in the mood to be fake or entertain. \n\nEnd rant.",

            "selftext": "I just need to share, because I got so many people who implied that I was exaggerating how sick I\u2019d been all through pregnancy. I\u2019m not proud at all to have lost weight, but it does slightly validate what I\u2019d been expressing for months. \n\nI started throwing up and feeling sick on January 1. My husband\u2019s family celebrated Christmas that day and I struggled to stay in the room. My SIL joked that I was pregnant, but I tested negative that morning and thought it was impossible. Turns out she was right and my body decided to take on nausea earlier than usual.\n\nFrom January 1 until the day I delivered (Sep 12), I was nauseous 24/7. I took Diclegis every day until the end, and that was the only thing that enabled me to keep down liquids. It generally kept me from vomiting, though I dry heaved many times a day. I was diagnosed with HG around week 5, was given IV fluids at times, and just couldn\u2019t eat much at all the entire pregnancy. \n\nThankfully, my baby got everything he needed. I had multiple growth scans because my weight kept dropping even into the third trimester, and he was right on target at every one. He was born healthy at 7 pounds 5 oz at 39w6.\n\nTwo hours after I delivered, the hospital brought me dinner. I had been feeling off but couldn\u2019t even express why, until the food came and I realized that the odd feeling was a complete lack of nausea. Since then, I have had no nausea at all, can eat what I want, actually have an appetite instead of forcing myself to eat, and life is blissful. \n\nI weighed myself when we got home out of curiosity and have lost 28-30 pounds between pre-pregnancy and 3 days pp. I\u2019m not proud of the weight loss, it\u2019s not about that. But after months of people asking how I felt or commenting that I wasn\u2019t eating enough as if it were my fault, the scale was slightly validating. Maybe that\u2019s wrong, but I\u2019m just being honest.",

Still, I had 40 lbs to go but I naively assumed breastfeeding would take care of it so I didn\u2019t worry about cutting the calories. Insert shock face when I stepped on the scale two months later and had actually gained weight. \n\nI felt gross and unhealthy. My joints were hurting from the excess weight and I was sluggish. So I started counting my calories religiously and working out 3x/week. 8 months post partum and I am 5lbs away from my pre-pregnancy weight! \n\nBut apparently everyone has an opinion. \n\nEvery time I see my mother in law - \u201cwhy do you keep getting skinnier and skinnier?! You need to focus on Baby Girl and worry about eating enough to give her good milky!\u201d (Gag me)\n\nMy friend, who\u2019s getting married this year and I am a bridesmaid in her wedding, along with another friend in her wedding. They have been heavier girls their entire lives and all have recently lost a lot of weight due to keto. They were talking about how amongst them they\u2019ve lost almost an entire persons worth of weight. I said \u201cmake it 1.5 people when you add my 60 lbs lost\u201d. Their response: \u201cyeah but that\u2019s baby weight, you lose those pounds easily\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019ve always been skinny, let us have this one\u201d and my personal favourite \u201cbut the baby just sucks the calories right out of you, it can\u2019t compare!\u201d\n\nMy husband - \u201coh you\u2019ve lose weight?\u201d \ud83d\ude11 although to his credit he says I\u2019ve always looked the same to him even at my heaviest, and always calls be beautiful. \n\nCan\u2019t anyone just say, congratulations, you look great.

It is equally shitty to dismiss anyone who is kids sleep as a liar. Throwing around an anecdotal story about how your SIL lied about her kid doesn't make it ok to call everyone a liar.

            "selftext": "I had been friends with her for more than ten years. We got pregnant around the same time. Mine was planned. Hers was not. \n\nShe immediately made the decision to terminate, and I supported her decision. Her boyfriend at the time was a bad person and it would have been a horrible environment for her and the child. I told her I was there if she needed to talk. That she could come live with us if she wanted to move out. \n\nI did not mention my progressing pregnancy unless she *asked*. At which point I would tell her I was vomiting and my back hurt and it was horrible. She would throw lines at me like \"could have had an abortion\". Which is a terrible thing to say to a mother with a planned and wanted pregnancy, but I understood. I got it. It was her way of making herself feel better she wasnt going through it too. \n\nSometime after her termination, she had a paragard implanted. Then the paragard became dislodged and had to be surgically removed. She said it was so incredibly painful, she decided to move forward with permanent sterilization at age 25. I supported her. Women who dont want to have children should not be forced to have children. I offered to make a grocery run or bring her food while she was recovering from the surgery. \n\nAfter sterilization, she immersed herself in childfree ways of thinking. Kids are \"crotch goblins\" who ruin lives. Parents are \"breeders\" who are immoral for contributing to overpopulation. Anyone who has kids is a bad person and a mombie and their life is over. \n\nShe made all these instagram posts about how free she was and she was going to build a van and live in it and travel the country since she was so free of children. And I say good for you, do what makes you happy and if that's living in a van then great! I would ask her how the van buildout was going. \n\nShe would ask me how parenthood was going and if I opened up and said \"this is hard. I miss sleep.\", rather than be supportive, again \"you could have had an abortion\". This offended me much more when my daughter was a living breathing human being in my arms than it did while I was pregnant and miserable. \n\nWe didnt talk for about six months after she said that to me. She was off living her glorious life of childfreedom in a van, I was here cleaning up spit up and chasing after a baby. \n\nShe texted me to ask if I could dump the baby on my husband and come drink, and finally I told her I thought that we had chosen different paths in life and I could no longer call myself friends with someone who clearly holds a negative opinion of me and my child's existence. We are trying for #2 and I dont need to hear \"could have had an abortion\" one more time in my life. \n\nI just dont know how you stay friends with someone when you are nothing but supportive of their choices and they are nothing but derisive about your own.",

If it's cold, stack thin blankets instead of using thicker blankets.\n\nCot bumpers are a no go.\n\nBabies feet must touch the bottom of the crib to avoid them shuffling under their blankets.\n\nTeddies are a no but you can have those little fabric squares with a Teddy head on them. Not sure what they're called.\n\n\n\nThis isn't just in the home. When my daughter was in NICU she struggled to keep her temp up after a cooling treatment so she had 6 blankets on at one point. She was also given a teddy called a 'cusky' by the NICU nurses to keep in her incubator/crib.\nI was encouraged to get my sent on it so she could smell mummy.\n\n\nMy point being that not everyone here is in the USA and I know it comes from a good place but its so annoying that people can't show off their beautiful baby without being bombarded with questions of baby's safety.",

            "selftext": "I\u2019m posting this from my alt account because I\u2019m not about to drop this bomb from my main. Before I start, I will say I do both breastfeeding and bottle feeding so I place absolutely no value on either form of feeding. I truly couldn\u2019t care less what you feed your baby as long as it is being fed enough to thrive. \n\nHowever, I am so incredibly sick of the hypocrisy I see everywhere - whether it be on any sub or any social media platform - policing how breastfeeding women are allowed to talk about their experience. \n\nWhat I mean by this is that I see comments on every single breastfeeding post telling the mom that her comments make the formula feeding reader feel badly because the FF wasn\u2019t able to breastfeed. Here are some examples:\n\n- FF feels triggered seeing BF post because she wasn\u2019t able to BF and this post makes her feel badly\n- FF feels BF poster is bragging about her experience when BF is simply talking about her experience, but the mere fact that a BF mom is talking about her experience makes FF mom thinks she\u2019s bragging \n- BF posts pic of her freezer stash and FF posts the highest upvoted comment in the thread accusing BF of bragging about her supply and reminding her that Fed is best and not everyone is capable of making a stash when OP literally never even mentioned formula or one being better than the other. \n\nLook, I understand not everyone can breastfeed. I understand some people want to and can\u2019t. I understand some people don\u2019t want to and don\u2019t. I understand some people try and aren\u2019t able to make it happen. These people are often the ones crying \u201cFed is best!\u201d the loudest. \n\nSo then why do these people have to go and shit all over a breastfeeding mom who is simply talking about breastfeeding?? Do these people really not believe fed is best, or are they hypocrites??\n\nFed is best is supposed to apply to both sides whether FF or BF.  Fed is best doesn\u2019t mean you get to snark on a woman who successfully breastfeeds when you couldn\u2019t or can\u2019t. Fed is best doesn\u2019t mean a woman who talks about her successful experience means she\u2019s bragging. \n\nFed is best is supposed to mean we can openly talk about either FF or BF without getting comments from the \u201cother side\u201d saying they\u2019re upset by the discussion. \n\nIf you are upset by the discussion of breastfeeding, that\u2019s not the issue of the person posting about breastfeeding. That\u2019s an issue within you. You should not feel guilty about formula feeding. If you do, buy The Subtle Art of Not Giving A Fuck or enroll in therapy or do whatever you need to do to not feel guilty about how you choose to feed your child. The only think you shouldn\u2019t be doing is comparing yourself to other moms and lashing out on them if the comments about their own experience makes you feel badly about yours.",

            "selftext": "My three month old has laryngomalacia, so her larynx cartilage is too soft. If she sleeps on her back she'll be gasping for air and wheezing on and off all night. The doctors told us early on that if she can lift her head and chest while in tummy time, that she could start tummy sleeping at three months. Well this kid loves tummy time and she can practically do the cobra pose. \n\nShe's been tummy sleeping for her daytime naps since her belly button stump fell off, since she wouldn't be gasping and we were right there by her. That is important because kids who have never tummy slept and then randomly start, have a higher risk for SIDS than babies who have tummy slept. I start her out on her back at night still, but after she wakes up gasping, I put her on her tummy, because her doctors have all said it's fine and, in her case, the best thing to do. \n\nI'm so sick of the older women in my life acting like I'm just doing this because I want to. I've explained to my mom, aunt, grandma, and others the baby's condition and how tummy sleeping prevents the gasping. I even played a video I took of her gasping and wheezing at night, which I had originally taken to show the doctor. Doesn't matter, they still give me weird looks and say how they think she should be on her back. \n\nI get it, back is best. That is unless the baby has a medical condition. We do all the other safe sleep things. I just wish people would give me a freaking break.",

There are many like her, who are just worried and don't have enough information to stop being worried. The easiest way to push someone into being anti vaccine is to shun them and tell them off instead of engaging in productive conversation with them.\n\nFor that matter, talk to the hardcore anti vaccine people too. Keep calm and keep talking, even if it feels like a brick wall. Be a source of information if you have it. If you're a medical professional, take precautions for your other patients, but try to make room for these. Don't push them away from doctors and hospitals for their entire lives.\n\nStudies have shown that it's possible to convince people who are hesitant about vaccines if you are calm and answer their questions. If you immediately get confrontational though, you'll lose. If you make jokes about dead babies, you lose. If you try to out-meme them, you lose. If you try to belittle them, you lose. You will never be able to get someone on your side if they think you think less of them.\n\nMost people who don't follow the recommended vaccine schedule are not fanatics. They are just scared and don't have enough information. They think doing nothing is safer than doing something. They are wrong, but it won't help just to say that. Engage with them. Don't push them away. \n\nOf course, protect your kids and keep whatever safe distance you're comfortable with, but never stop the conversation and always keep it respectful. \n\nDo not give up on this, please. For all of our children, please do not give up on people. And focus on addressing their questions and concerns, not on proving a point or being right. It doesn't help to be right if they don't believe you.",

But I just want to warn others. Being a mother is obviously quite exhausting and it's natural to let the ball drop every now and then, but damn.\n\nI decided to cosleep one night with my 7 week old boy. We have a cosleeper bassinet on my side of the bed but LO doesn't consider that good enough and sleeps really well when he's on my chest during the day. I thought, okay fuck it. Let's get some sleep. One night won't hurt from breaking the normal safe sleeping guidelines I meticulously follow.\n\nResult, great sleep! 5 solid hours. Woke up to feed, back to bed. Same position, belly down on my chest, nice and peaceful.\n\nUntil a few hours later when I woke up from him wiggling around on me. It didn't register at first what was actually happening. Turns out, I had pulled up our blankets up to my neck and completely over him. He was trapped. He was overheating. If he didn't fight it, if I didn't wake up, if it had been left any longer, he could have suffocated. I could've killed him. And for what? A few extra hours of sleep.\n\nNeedless to say I'm beating myself up. Terrified at how close we came. We're back to the normal arrangement, which is resulting in him waking up often again, but every time I wake up now at least I'm so happy to see his little face.\n\nMaybe there's a safer way to cosleep, but I'm too scared to try now. I gave in to exhaustion and my sleepy body reflexes betrayed me and my baby. Sigh. I dont know if I can forgive myself. \n\nPlease be careful everyone.",

I\u2019m American (where that wouldn\u2019t even be a conversation) but live in Sweden. Everyone I know and all the baby groups I\u2019m in, it\u2019s generally common to have crib bumpers, blankets, duvets, pillows, stuffed animals, etc. in the cribs. I mean these cribs are JAMMED PACKED with stuff. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a monster for only having a small blanket in the crib. It\u2019s also encouraged to use baby nests for sleeping. I think the official guidelines are not to do these things (though it\u2019s a bit fuzzy with pillows and baby nests) but a lot of medical professionals still say it\u2019s all fine. Shoot, both in and out of the hospital they encouraged me to co-sleep/bedshare. \n\nOn the other end, swaddling isn\u2019t done here and it\u2019s frowned upon. When I asked if they would show me how to do it in the hospital, they looked at me like I was nuts. Sleep sacks and suits are kind of laughed at.\n\nSo it got me thinking, what are the guidelines in your countries? Just curious to see how different they are. I know Reddit is very US based and I think most of the advice here is US based in terms of safety and I think they have some of the stricter guidelines (though it seems the UK, New Zealand and Australia are similar!) so got me wondering!",

We enter and of course EVERYONE insists on coming right up to LO, getting in her face, prodding her, wanting her attention, wanting to carry her. Poor kid turns into a whiny clingy mess because she is obviously overwhelmed. She turns away from anyone trying to hold her, she whines and cries, she won't sit in her high chair, she won't even let me sit down with her on my lap. (She'll only let me, her dad, or my mom hold her.) \n\nFinally my mom tells me to sit down and try to eat and takes LO, which I'm fine with... Until I see her allow someone, a stranger to LO I must emphasis, to forcibly rip LO right out from her arms and WALK AWAY under some deluded logic of \"If you don't see your parents/grandmother, then you won't cry!\" while LO obviously is distressed and CRYING. I immediately stand up and head over, only to be waved away. That is when I explode with \"DON'T DO THAT TO HER!\" and take my child back. \n\nWe end up leaving the whole event early because LO was just not having it. \n\nAfter everything, I get a text from Mom saying: \"you overreacted. No one will want to carry your child anymore and she will be loved less.\" \n\nEXCUSE ME? I overreacted? My kid was CRYING and in distress and I overreacted because I didn't want to put her through that? And I'm sorry, but NO ONE SHOULD BE CARRYING MY CHILD IF MY CHILD CLEARLY DOES NOT WANT TO BE CARRIED BY THAT PERSON ANYWAY. Why shouldn't I respect the wishes of my helpless Baby? \n\nAnd when did 'Love' = ripping my overwhelmed child AWAY from the security of her parents? \n\nWhat is Wrong with people???

So many other women commented that they have the \u201cyou do xy so much better\u201c problem. And honestly I have the same issues with my partner. But sometimes I think of my grandmother who singlehandedly raised three boys while being on a full time job and managing the whole household - because that was \u201cher job\u201c as a woman. I never asked my grandfather but I don't think he minded that my grandmother worked. He started doing small things like washing his plate up after eating (if he ate alone) in his 80's. He was the kind of father that doesn't kiss or hold his sons after the age of 5. \n\nI don't mean to say it's ok to expect mom to do all the baby related work because it's tradition or \u201cnormal\u201c - especially not if mom is also working - but we have come a long way. Sometimes I am amazed how many dads I see pushing strollers and playing with their children in the park. So I guess I just wanted to have a moment of appreciation for all modern dads who are doing a better job at dadding than their dads and being better partners to their wives/girlfriends. Many if not most of them are trying to learn and adapt. Their sons will no doubt never question the need to learn how to change a diaper or how to put baby to bed.\n\nAnd to my partner: you are doing a great job of learning and doing better every day and I really appreciate that you are working so hard on yourself!",

            "selftext": "TLDR: stopped making homemade baby food and I realize it doesn't make me less of a mom.\n\nAlright alright alright, my LO is 8 mos and I thought I could be the money-saving, fresh food puree-ing, homemade meal-making, effortless-seeming mom. \n.....\nFor me, that was nothing but trouble and stress. I work 40 hour weeks with a 1 hr commute... truthfully I don't get enough time with my baby. When my LO started solids, I thought making homemade baby food was the most logical choice -\n\nMaybe save some money, get to know exactly what she's eating, be the mom who \"goes above and beyond\" to nuture her baby.\n\nF**k THAT. There's only so many foods that will freeze well, and only so many free hours in a week to sit down and make huge batches that will last. I simply cannot make her fresh foods everyday. \n\nAnd now she wants more than just a serving of bananas, or sweet potatoes in a day. This little chunker wants/needs fruits, veggies, protein, iron, etc. etc. I was feeling so defeated because I knew that she needed to start having a bigger variety of foods in a day, and I only have so much time and energy.\n\nSo today we went shopping and picked out all sorts of canned, jarred (jar-ed??), and pouched baby foods. There's honestly some decent looking ones with good prices out there. \n\nAnd. I. Feel. So. Relieved. \nThis is what's right for me, and makes a happier mama for my baby. I don't need to \"slave over a hot stove\" to get her all the nutrients she needs from solids.\n\nMy point is, if you want/are able to make purees and foods for your baby, awesome. More power to ya. If you don't want/aren't able to, awesome. More power to ya.",

            "selftext": "Hello BeyondTheBump! \n\nFor those of you who don't know me or haven't seen me in a while, I'm luca_overthemoon (Luca) and the original creator of this subreddit handed me the reigns a few years ago. For many years I was the primary if not the only active moderator in the subreddit until very recently. We added a new moderator to the team when /u/madalitchy and I had to take a step back due to things going on in our personal lives.\n\nI'm in the US Army and have been on orders for most of the year, sometimes without access to internet service or a computer which is why you haven't seen me in the subreddit.\n\nI've checked in intermittently and have an overwhelming number of messages in my inbox from users in this subreddit as well as moderators from other subreddits complaining about the mod we added to the team a few months ago: /u/ernieball. I want to let you know that *I hear you* and I've spent the last two days reading every message, I've gone through post histories, I've gone through removedreddit comments, and that moderator has officially been removed from this subreddit. \n\nIt is clear that her attitude and the way of moderating is *not* on the same page as that of the creator and myself, who was entrusted to run the subreddit. I want to apologize to each and every single person who has had a personal issue with that moderator, who has had comments removed, who has been banned without proper warning, or who has been led to believe that you are not welcome here.\n\nFirst and foremost, I want to address the largest number of complaints I received: comments being removed.\n\nI looked at the removed comments and many of them *do not violate our subreddits rules,* and I'm sorry that many of you have been silenced for having different opinions that do not violate the rules of our subreddit. That is not going to happen anymore and if your comment IS removed from today on, you will receive a message/reason as to WHY it was removed.\n\nNext, about the recent PostPartum bodies thread. ALL POSTPARTUM BODIES ARE NORMAL - YOU ARE WELCOME TO POST YOUR POSTPARTUM BODY REGARDLESS OF HOW YOU LOOK AND ANY COMMENTS SHAMING A WOMAN FOR BEING BRAVE ENOUGH TO POST HER BODY WILL BE REMOVED. \n\nThis subreddit is not the best place for photos overall, because we prefer to keep our content text-based for purposes of venting/ranting and seeking advice, but I want to echo what /u/scoutiesteph said in her comment to the \"Mod Post\" regarding the PP bodies thread - \n\n\"If you are comfortable enough to post a picture of your body, no matter how it looks, you are not responsible for other people's feelings. If someone is happy, jealous, etc. that is on them to manage. Body positivity is for EVERYONE. You don't get to gatekeeper what someone else is legitimately allowed to struggle with.\" You don't have to meet ANY criteria of postpartum body to be \"acceptable,\" in this community. \n\nPeople are allowed to be insecure about their bodies even if it's your dream body. We are in this TOGETHER and we're all accepting how our bodies have changed. My insecurities about my body are not a smack to you and your insecurities, do not take someone's PERSONAL STRUGGLE with their own body as an attack on you. \n\nYou can post your PP body to humblebrag no matter what size you are.\n\nYou can post your PP body to vent and cry, no matter what size you are.\n\nYou can post your PP to get advice on how to fix loose skin, mom butt, etc. NO MATTER WHAT SIZE YOU ARE.\n\nIf you are triggered by PP bodies that \"bounced back,\" we can add tags to PP body threads with trigger warnings to help mitigate those threads from being shoved in your face without warning.\n\nI am going to get this subreddit back on the right track, so please bear with me as I am currently the only moderator and I have a LOT to catch up on.\n\nIf you have active complaints, please comment here or send me a PM directly. If you need clarification on something, send me a message.",

The date of the event is August 18th (I know, super early, but we have to have it at this time because my BIL and his family are coming in, that we haven't seen in 3 years and they live in Africa) so by the time the party comes, she'll barely be a month old. \n\nI want to include in the event information a line that states as politely as possible, \"With our apologies, we ask that in consideration of the health of our daughter, we request anyone feeling under the weather celebrate with us in spirit.\" \n\nMy husband thinks this is rude to include, but I don't think so. Especially considering a majority of his family doesn't think common sense situations like this through and someone could very well show up with a cold and pass it on to her... I mean his mother laughs at me and mocks me when I ask her to wash her hands before holding or touching our 5 day old baby.\n\nSO, am I being over baring and rude? Or do you think this request is a modest reasonable one?   \nYour opinions are appreciated!   \nAs I said, this is my first post, so please be kind. Thanks in advance!\n\n\\*\\* I\"m a first time mom, so I may be a little overly cautious and as I said, she's currently only 5 days old.",

            "selftext": "Guys I\u2019m really struggling here. My son is 3 weeks old and was born at 36+6 due to IUGR. He had low sugar and was given formula pretty much immediately. On top of that he was too small to get a good latch and the nurses and LCs were super concerned about him over-exerting himself to even let me try to breastfeed for more than 5min at the hospital. So I pump and FF and try to BF with a shield (but hardly ever succeed). I\u2019ve seen lactation consultants but can never seem to get it right once they leave. To top it off my supply is extremely low (I\u2019m lucky to get 30ml per pumping session) and my nipples are sore as hell. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s from over-pumping or thrush. (Yes I have a call in to my doc). So at this point my BF attempts have gone out the window because OUCH. Even pumping is painful. \n\nI KNOW that \u201cfed is best\u201d but every time I read or hear that phrase I want to punch someone in the face (and I swear it usually is coming from someone who is EBF). It fucking KILLS me that I\u2019m not able to BF. Like wtf is wrong with my body that I can\u2019t provide this basic human need for my child the way nature intended? I had to unfollow my bumper group on FB because people keep posting pics of their freezer stash or the 4oz they got off their haaka in \u201cjust 10 min.\u201d Or their  \u201cworries about oversupply\u201d.  It\u2019s just all so defeating. \n\nI don\u2019t want to give up, it\u2019s only been 3 weeks, but those 3 weeks have been agonizing and exhausting. I\u2019m not spending enough time with my son because I\u2019m always fucking pumping. But when I do feed him from a bottle I don\u2019t feel any sort of bond with him. I feel so disconnected. Not to mention formula is fucking expensive. I just want my breasts to work like their supposed to. I want to be able to stare lovingly down at my son while snuggles my breast after a feed instead of him getting hysterical because milk doesn\u2019t flow from my shield as fast as it does from the bottle. I want to be able to just pop a boob in his mouth instead of preparing a bottle.  I\u2019m just so upset and pissed that all this not an option for me and I don\u2019t know how to accept it. My son is fed and healthy and I KNOW that\u2019s the most important thing, but fuck this is really hard. \n\nSide note - I am looking into therapists as well for postpartum, but I really needed to vent that out.",

So if you are just passing thru via layover you are shit out of luck. \n\nThe family restrooms are GROSS. Seriously, they appear to never clean them and they reek of shit. Plus very busy.  You could wait an hour for one to free up. \n\nBecause I wasn't comfortable pumping in public (very crowded airport) I had to make food for my baby in a bathroom stall.\n\nYou don't make shit and food in the same place.  Then I got to clean pump parts in front of no less than 70 other women as they passed thru a busy bathroom. \n\nI saw at least 2 other women doing the same thing while I was there.\n\nDisgraceful.  SHAME on you Ronald Reagan airport. \n\nThus ends my PSA.  Hopefully I can save at least 1 other family from making my mistake.\n\nBonus picture of my setup. Pumping standing up.

Thank God my husband is home today and is upstairs in the nursery holding our 12 week old daughter so she will sleep.\n\nI don't know what to do. I can't fight with this kid anymore over naps. I watch her wake windows religiously, I try to follow a routine. Still she fights sleep. I spend so much time trying to get her down to have her sleep 30, 20, sometimes 10 minutes. \n\nAt night we were starting to do okay. She'd sleep in her crib 6 hours but idk what happened. She won't sleep through the night unless we cosleep. \n\nI'm a prisoner of my child. I don't leave the house because she hates the car seat and doesn't like the car either. She fusses the whole time I run errands. Her wake window is still less than 2 hours so it's honestly hard to go out anyway because she won't sleep anywhere!! \n\nI don't know what to do. I'm going to hurt her or myself. I don't want to let her cry herself to sleep but I can't continue to spend my days this way rocking and bouncing and shushing over white noise trapped and bored out of my mind in a dark room. I'm supposed to be enjoying these last few weeks with her before I go back to work but I'm so angry all the time instead. \n\nWhat am I doing so wrong? Why can I not fix this problem?",

This email tells me that I have a new bill in my online medical account. I check it. It appears as though after somehow figuring out how to pay *my* bills for labor and delivery ($4,000- yes, with \"good\" insurance), I now also owe $1,800 for my daughter. Yes, in America, the hospital can apparently charge a newborn baby from the day they're born until they day they leave the hospital. My newborn daughter is paying $1,800 for spending the first two days of her life in our hospital room- not even in the nursery. We are going to pay nearly $6,000 to have a child *WITH INSURANCE.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm sorry for the negativity. I just don't know how I will ever be able to afford to have a second child here. We are already going to be paying $1,600 monthly for daycare for one child. I pay $1,000 monthly on student loans. We have a mortgage. It's sickening. Truthfully, America sucks.

Lo and behold, 3 months to the day I gave birth I end up in the hospital having gallbladder surgery.\n\nThe whole ordeal wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it'd be, taking care of baby requires quite a bit of help and I'm pretty sore, but it got me thinking how some of you mamas go through 9 months of pregnancy, which in and of itself is a great feat, and then go through labor and end up getting cut open far more than I've been just to turn around and have to take care of a brand new life and, for FTMs, get adjusted to a whole new way of life while trying to recover from major surgery.\n\nDon't get me wrong, vaginal birth isn't easy, I remember how hard it was to even walk, but I also think a lot of women still get flak for c-sections, which is ridiculous.\n\nSo for all you mamas who are dealing with major surgery and a new baby, have in the past and will in the future, don't let ANYBODY get you down, you are incredibly strong, fierce mamas who've done amazing things with your bodies, for your babies, and you deserve all the love and care in the world. \u2764\u2764",

            "selftext": "My mother in law loves kids, and has been taking care of them for the last 30 some years. Because of this, we planned on having her watch our son part time while I was at work. She was so excited to watch him and we thought it would work out great. However, we soon realized that she doesn't treat him like someone else's kid, and treats him like her own. This would be fine, but we really need her to respect our boundaries. She left him with a 15 year old after we specifically told her not to, and got mad and tried to manipulate us into saying that she was right to do so. She will not admit that leaving a baby in a carseat on the floor is dangerous, she tells me that I \"really have to do CIO, there's no other way\" (no offense to those who do CIO, but I don't like being told how to raise my son). Because of this, and her rude, manipulative behavior my husband and I decided that she will not babysit him at all. She refuses to hear us out. She calls my husband, yells at him, then cries and hangs up before he can talk. She says we have to earn their respect before she will respect our right as his parents to make these decisions. She has since disowned him, saying \"I hope you're happy and I hope she's happy for ripping a son away from a family who loves him.\" She hasn't reached out since. This came out of nowhere and I'm honestly shocked that she's like this. She's been great in the past. She's been a part of my life since I was in 6th grade and I've always thought highly of her. My husband is brokenhearted and blaming himself. Yesterday, my SIL, who has been my best friend since middle school drove out to our house to say she can no longer respect and support us. She believed the worst and would never actually have a conversation about it. I'm still in shock over losing her friendship. This is a fucking mess. All I wanted to do was keep my kid safe and not fight to be his parent.",

I haven\u2019t really been able to put it into words until now. \n\nI was closing in on my due date and one of the most persistent questions I was asked was \u201care you going to have a natural birth?\u201d \n\nWtf does that even mean? Is the baby going to exit my body? Well yeah, so isn\u2019t that natural?\n\nOh, you mean whether or not I\u2019m going to have pain meds. Because If I decide to be more comfortable during one of the most painful experiences of my life, it somehow makes it not natural? Really? \n\nEvery time I see a post in whatever mom group I\u2019m in and I see a mom lament how she didn\u2019t have a \u201cnatural birth\u201d because she had an epidural. Every post I see where someone tries to tough it out, and develops PTSD because they felt they needed to have that natural birth experience, I feel so sad for them. \n\n\nYour birth experience isn\u2019t less valid because you had pain meds. \n\nBirth is birth. There are no pain Olympics. You don\u2019t get a gold medal for giving birth without drugs, nor do you get one for using drugs. \n\nBut do you know you get? A nifty baby \n\nI hate the term \u201cnatural birth\u201d so so much \n\nY\u2019all are so damn cool for growing, then giving birth to an entire new human! Who the fuck cares how baby got here. \n\nSo fuck the people who make you feel less for using pain meds. Fuck the expectation that we have to suffer in order to be real moms. Science is cool! Embrace modern medicine. \n\nIf you give birth without meds, you are fucking rad. \n\nIf you give birth with meds, you are amazing \n\n\nOne is not better than the other.

Ask permission to hold the baby. You don\u2019t know what kind of mom I am - in my case, I\u2019m a loss mom and when it comes to my baby I\u2019m a stage 5 clinger and have issues with him being too far away from me (I\u2019m working on that) and if I say no, be cool, let me get there on my own time.\n\n2.) Wash. Your. Hands. I don\u2019t care if you think they are clean, they aren\u2019t. Wash them anyway. No sink? Find hand sanitizer and don\u2019t make me ask twice! Babies are little and our germs are big. You\u2019ll get mad bonus points if you wash them right away.\n\n3.) Don\u2019t touch babies face - this means don\u2019t pinch her cheeks please, don\u2019t touch her nose (I know it\u2019s cute) it\u2019s a germ thing and for this mom it makes me uncomfortable.\n\n4.) Do not under any circumstances, stick your finger in my babies mouth. I will shiv you with the first available sharp item while taking my baby away from you. This is not cool (unless mom says it\u2019s ok) it\u2019s intrusive and will make mom hate your guts and good luck getting baby cuddles in the future.\n\n5.) Don\u2019t feed baby anything ever ever ever unless mom says it\u2019s ok. See shiv reference.\n\n6.) Don\u2019t kiss my baby. Unless you are in the inner circle (grandparent, aunt, bffs etc) assume you don\u2019t have kiss privileges. It\u2019s an intimate gesture and some moms are not ok with this. This also means don\u2019t kiss her wee hands - she shoves them in all kinds of places so trust me you don\u2019t want to do that. \n\n7.) Don\u2019t let your kid hold or touch my baby unless hands are clean, you\u2019re there to support both baby and kid and mom said it\u2019s ok. Kids are curious but they are also easily distracted and have weak-ass noodle arms that can\u2019t even lift bro. My baby is fat and squirmy and should never be far from a grown up.\n\n8.) If baby starts to cry, don\u2019t insist you keep holding him and try to be the Cesar Milan of babies, pass him back to mom. It stresses us out to like Defcon 1 if we can\u2019t soothe our baby. And before you argue, 1 is the most sever level and 5 means everything\u2019s peachy. \n\n9.) Don\u2019t be like \u201comg her head is huuuuuge\u201d it might be but for the love of god shut up and keep it to yourself. Babies can look weird, it all settles out as they get older so don\u2019t be that person commenting on their growth/something you don\u2019t like. It honestly makes you look like a turd, leave the baby alone, and say \u201comg she\u2019s so perfect!\u201d Don\u2019t mean it? We don\u2019t care, just be nice.\n\n10.) Bonus points: Ask mom if you can get her anything. Yes we are still humans and have needs, just a glass of water or sometimes a tissue because my nose is running like a tap and I\u2019m hot and sweaty and my arms are always full. Be nice to us and chances are we\u2019ll be like \u201cyou wanna hold the baby?\u201d and there is no higher compliment :)",

But, the other day a friend of mine told me something I think is the worst adive to the date. I didn't say anything for respect, just noded.\n\nShe told me that after birth in the hospital when the nurses start asking how I am, I have to say fine to everything. In her case the nurses noticed right away that she was having a hard time so they send a therapist right away and told her to go a psicologist after the hospital. She had a traumatic birth so the nurses and doctors kept an eye on her. When she told me that story the first time I thought \"wow, that is amazing, that the hospital was so quick and cared a lot\" but the other day she told me that\n\n\"Just say that you are fine to everything, or they will send you to therapy, it's normal to feel down at the beggining, but it's nothing, believe me\"\n\nOk, I thought \"so, you are telling me that even If I'm not ok, I have to lie so they will let me alone?\" I have never had depresion before, but I take PPD very seriously. I had a hard 1st trimester and it afected me emotionaly very bad, so I'm afraid after birth to get so tired that will affect my mind set, so I want to take that seriously.\n\nAnyway, that is my story. Some people will say that there is no bad advise, not to the point to argue with someone, but I think there are some enough to ignore it.",

            "selftext": "Earlier this week I was sitting in bed feeding my 2 week old daughter. I was exhausted and I fell asleep. I woke to the sounds of her cries. It didn\u2019t immediately register to me what happened until I realized she wasn\u2019t in my arms anymore. I panicked and jumped out of the bed to find her on the floor between my bed and the nightstand. I picked her up and noticed a bump on the right side of her head. At this point I\u2019m hysterical. I wake my boyfriend up and call the pediatrician but it\u2019s the middle of the night and it can be up to 30 minutes before the on call doctor gets back to me. At this point my daughter falls asleep and we\u2019re having trouble waking her so we put her in the car seat (which luckily got her to cry again) and drive over to the ER. When we got there we were quickly triaged and then the nurse said they\u2019re calling a trauma alert. At this point I\u2019m freaking out and sobbing. They bring her into the trauma room and she\u2019s surrounded by about 20 people. The nurse pulled me aside and said \u201cI know this looks scary, but it\u2019s just so she gets care quickly. She\u2019s actually looking very good.\u201d That was reassuring but it was terrifying to watch. They performed an abdominal X-ray and a head CT. Both of which were negative for anything abnormal thankfully. At the end of it all she was deemed to be perfectly fine. She was acting like her normal self and other then a bump and bruise nothing was wrong. We followed up with the pediatrician the next day and we were told she hit her head in the perfect spot because she hit a boney area and not a soft area. I\u2019m so thankful she\u2019s okay, but I feel horrible for causing her harm and then subjecting her to tests with radiation. It\u2019s days later now and I\u2019ve cried every day since it happened. I can\u2019t believe I let this happen to my baby. I feel like the worst mother in the world. I guess I\u2019m just looking to vent because I\u2019m too ashamed to talk to anyone I know about it.",

            "selftext": "I only did it for 4 months, but looking back, I totally regret it. I feel accomplished for having made it that far because EP-ing for even a week is no freaking joke. But I shouldn\u2019t have valued it over my sanity. \n\nMy baby was pre-term, and he was too lazy to latch. I met with an LC and tried to latch every single day, many times a day, and no luck. He would just scream at my breast. So I resolved that I would EP, and at least get the baby his milk that way. \n\nNow, for some women, EP-ing might be less of a sacrifice, like if you take fair baby care shifts with your partner. I didn\u2019t have a whole lot of help from my husband because he started working right away. So it meant that I was the one pumping every 2-3 hrs round the clock, washing bottles, pump parts, and feeding baby. As soon as I stopped one thing, I had to start another. I was getting like 2 hrs of sleep a day before baby started sleeping through the night. \n\nGranted, towards the end of my EP journey, I cut down sessions, pumping every 4-5 hrs and supplementing with some formula. But in order to establish supply at the beginning, you really have to be that dedicated. It really does a number on you: late night pump sessions with that awful whirring sound, a baby who won\u2019t sleep at night so you have to pump with him on your lap, obsessing over EVERY oz. of breast milk. The obsessing is the worst part I think. It becomes like this competition against yourself, and some days your supply isn\u2019t as great, which causes you to spiral into a panic for no reason! Sure breastmilk is truly magical and amazing, but formula isn\u2019t poison. The first time I had to give my baby formula I cried like a crazy person. Why?!? It was food, and that was ALL he wanted! \n\nAt 4 months, my baby caught an infection and spent some nights in the hospital, and that taught me the value of simply being present with my baby. I didn\u2019t pump the whole time he was there, and I took it as a sign to just stop. We went full formula, and he has been thriving just as much as he was before on breastmilk. He is a big, active, happy boy. I haven\u2019t lost anything frombottle feeding him. I am the light of his world (literally the way his eyes light up when he sees me gives me life!!!). When I bottle feed him to go to sleep, he stares at me, grabs my cheeks, smiles, and fades away in my arms. Babies just want to be held close and loved, and that is not dependent on the contents of their bottle. \n\nAt the end of the day, breastfeeding is so amazing and if it works it works! EP-ing is an option thanks to technology, and if you have lots of help, it can work too. But ladies, if it\u2019s weighing on you mentally and emotionally (those \u201cI\u2019m a failure\u201d feelings because you can\u2019t traditionally breastfeed are no joke), step back and reflect if it\u2019s worth it. I spent way too much time adding even MORE stress into my life than I should\u2019ve. \n\nI just wanted to share this for any mamas who feel like they\u2019re on the verge of going nuts over EP-ing. I feel you, and baby will be ok if you need to give up! It\u2019s not failure, everyone is different but we all have the same goal of being at peace and being able to enjoy these little babies!",

            "selftext": "(Note: this is in the US where paid surrogacy is legal.)\n\nI posted about this on r/povertyfinance, and it generated a good discussion (which you can read [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/bkkl6w/i_paid_off_my_students_loans_by_becoming_a_paid/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)), so I thought it would be worth sharing here as well.\n\nOne year ago, I made the decision to be a surrogate for a lovely couple in New York to help pay off my student loans from grad school and start saving up for a home. I'm a single mother in my 30s with a child of my own living in North Carolina. I really wanted a way to get some extra income and help someone else in the process. I'm posting this because I searched Reddit for posts from other women who did something like this and I can't really find any, so hopefully this helps a few other women make the decision whether to make a choice like mine. Overall, I think it's one of the best decisions I've ever made.\n\nIt wasn't an easy decision, but it helped that the process wasn't as hard as I thought. (Just long!)\n\nI spent a lot of time researching the various agencies and the one I chose\\* paid the most I could find for a first-time surrogate. The couple I was matched up with is really nice. I got to meet them in New York City a couple times when I flew up there during the medical clearance process and embryo implantation. (My expenses were paid for too, so I got to visit New York for free!) They're both sweet and loving... I'm glad I could help. The poor wife has had a really hard time conceiving, with several heartbreaking experiences, over the last several years....\n\nI'm currently 30 weeks along and I've had a easy pregnancy so far. I'm so excited for them to meet their new baby in August. (And because the embryo was developed from the husband's sperm and the wife's egg, the baby will be genetically theirs 100%.) I can tell they're really excited! The wife texts me all the time to see how I'm doing, and she likes to send me food. (She's really generous!)\n\nOn that note, let me tell you some of the requirements I had to meet to qualify. They weren't that hard.\n\n* You should be between 21-39 years old.\n* With my agency, you need a BMI between 18-32\n* You can't be on government financial support (Like food stamps or other programs)\n* You need to have given birth to and be raising at least one child\n\nAfter paying my student loans off in full this month, I am putting the rest of the money towards a down payment on a house. That money buys a lot of house in my area. :)\n\nIt hasn't all been an easy process. These are the main drawbacks/cons I've run into so far:\n\nCons:\n\n* Getting approved and implanted took a long time - 8 months in my case. There were payments for getting matched with parents and getting cleared medically, but the monthly surrogacy payments didn't start until after the fetal heartbeat was confirmed a second time. There was a lot of waiting. (Worth it!)\n* I had to inject myself once a day for about six weeks. I'm not a fan of needles so the first few were tough. After a week I got used to it, and after a couple of weeks it become completely routine. It's really not that bad.\n* Lots of tests and appointments before I was approved. Thankfully, I work from home (I'm a translator), so I had the flexibility to get the testing done on their schedule.\n* For three weeks I had to go to a nearby fertility clinic to get a blood draw 2x a week. Once I actually got pregnant, it went down to just the standard pregnancy OB appointments.\n\nHere are the top positive aspects for me:\n\nPros:\n\n* The couple are really nice and loving, and I love how I'm able to help them with something they are so excited about.\n* I got to fly to NYC a couple times during the process.\n* Easy pregnancy (in my case - I know I'm super lucky here!) that's over in about 9 months.\n* I'm getting paid $50,000+ in total which covered my student loans, helps me take care of my little girl, and goes a long way towards a house here.\n\nReally, it was one of the best decisions I think I've ever made. Those student loans were a huge burden. I was worried I\u2019d never be able to be a home owner and take care of my daughter. I can\u2019t even describe the difference it made in our lives... and more importantly, the difference it's going to make in the lives of the couple I matched with. I managed to get it all taken care of while helping a great family finally have the child they've wanted for years.\n\nIf you have any questions for me, feel free to ask!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(\\*I didn't include any personal information here, like which agency I'm working through, but if you want to know any personal details, I'm happy to discuss over PMs.)",

Both will make them scream. \n\nMake sure you are only eating things freshly picked from the garden of the gods and cooked by professional French chefs because breastmilk can effect baby. \n\nSleep when baby sleeps.

            "selftext": "I'm struggling guys. \nI think mostly with breastfeeding and the nights. My little guy gulps in massive amounts of air when he feeds and then is unhappy because he's full of gas for what seems like hours or until the next feed then it all starts again. The nights are worse he thrashes at the breast and I have started supplementing with some formula at night time because he seems ravenous. I produce a good amount of milk i can feed him and then still get about 2-4oz when I pump. Sometimes he feeds every hour on the hour it seems. Lately he's had a super bad diaper rash, so bad it's bleeding and I've had 2 diff prescription creams in the last 2 weeks that haven't helped. I've been letting him go diaper free for a few hours a day in hopes that it will dry out the rash. I don't know if it's something I'm eating like dairy or coffee that's giving him an upset stomach and a diaper rash. My nipples feel like they are shooting out Lazer beams they are so painful. I have a prescription cream for my nipples and have been using a nipple shield and I still have alot of pain. The lactation consultant said he has a small tongue tie but not enough to have it addressed. If my husband wasn't going to give me such a hard time about formula feeding I think I would be open to switching. I do enjoy the bonding of breast feeding but I feel exhausted in every way. I don't know if he's getting enough nutrition because of how he thrashes at the breast sometimes and just gets beside himself. I don't know what to think or do",

            "selftext": "Let\u2019s take a moment to recognize the American moms here. Now let\u2019s take another to recognize how much this country shits on its mothers.\n\n\nAs an American mother laboring in the free market, you may face a several thousand dollar [bill](https://www.cnn.com/2013/07/09/opinion/declercq-childbirth-costs/index.html) for your prenatal care and delivery. Happy Mother\u2019s Day! But have no fear, you won\u2019t have to worry about finances if your pregnancy kills you here in the good Ole U.S. of A, where [maternal](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/05/09/key-lowering-americas-high-rates-maternal-mortality/?utm_term=.9c0ac68c43df) [mortality](https://www.npr.org/2017/05/12/527806002/focus-on-infants-during-childbirth-leaves-u-s-moms-in-danger) [rates] (https://www.pressdemocrat.com/opinion/9587889-181/pd-editorial-for-mothers-day) are the highest in the developed world and steadily climbing. \n\n\nIf you do make it out alive, you\u2019ll be plagued by fears of your tiny baby catching measles from one of the village idiots who refuses to vaccinate because of something he saw on Facebook, the world\u2019s greatest medium for those who were never taught how to differentiate between science and memes. Will American lawmakers do anything to combat the spreading measles epidemic here? I think you know the [answer](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2019/05/10/amid-measles-outbreak-little-effort-to-kill-vaccine-exemptions) to that. Good luck getting your government to give a shit about your precious baby once she\u2019s out of the womb.\n\n\nBut you, American mom, really shouldn\u2019t let your fears ruin your time with your infant. Lord knows you won\u2019t have enough of it. At least not if you want to keep the career that cost you a lifetime of student debt to achieve. Whether you\u2019re one of the ~quarter of American moms who return to work [two weeks](http://inthesetimes.com/article/18151/the-real-war-on-families) postpartum (stitches and all!), can afford to take 12 weeks of unpaid leave, or are one of the extremely lucky to work for an employer who offers paid leave, your time with your baby will be painfully short in comparison to much of the [rest of the world](https://www.insider.com/maternity-leave-around-the-world-2018-5).\n\n\nBut hey, who needs maternity leave when you get a free breast pump! A FREE PUMP. Don\u2019t say Uncle Sam never did anything for you. Strap that medieval torture device to your nipples and be grateful. Make sure you have a photo of your baby handy to boost your production. You\u2019re not going to want to spend your money on formula while giving all of it to [childcare](https://www.fatherly.com/news/maps-average-cost-childcare-us/). What about childcare subsidies, you ask? LOL. \n\n\nDon\u2019t worry, childcare won\u2019t always cost as much as college tuition. Soon you can send your child to kindergarten, where she\u2019ll learn how to write her name and where to hide from a madman with a weapon of war. Sorry, I can\u2019t bring myself to link to that one. We\u2019d be here all day.\n\n\nJesus Christ I can\u2019t breathe. \n\n\nBeing my daughter\u2019s mother is the best thing that ever happened to me, and I'll gladly take the sleepless nights, but it feels like it should be just a LITTLE bit easier. And I love this country, but it disgusts me that lawmakers are buying their mothers flowers today when they don't really give a fuck about mothers. \n\n\nAnyway, I do hope you all have a lovely Mother's Day. You deserve to be celebrated, especially for keeping it all together in the face of so much bullshit.  &lt;3",

That's it.  Then hold her until she wakes up.\n\nNow I feel like an idiot for not figuring it out sooner!  I've been doing this stupid thing where I put her down in her crib to sleep, then I do a few chores, and now I realize that's completely wrong!  \n\nAnyway I hope this info helps someone out.  Before I go here's a few other gems I learned this week while she was here: food can never go bad in the fridge, and video games will rot your brain (but tv is fine.)  Oh and not wanting fruit at 9:30pm means you don't eat healthy.  Enjoy.",

He works a decent amount, between around 50 hours a week and I\u2019m a stay at home mom, so it\u2019s been assumed that I\u2019ll do most of the house chores and child rearing, which really isn\u2019t a problem to me. My problem is that whenever I do ask him to help with our nearly 4 month old daughter, he either simply opts out and says \u201cno\u201d and does whatever it is he wants, or he\u2019ll do it and half ass it. He manages to go 24 hour spans without changing diapers, often. And when he does change a diaper. He\u2019ll give the baby immediately back to me, her onesie unclipped, the diaper sitting in the diaper changing pad and the wipes open and then just walks away! Who does that! If I have to clean up after you, how is that helping me? This morning, I asked him to take the baby and he took her for five minutes and then gave her back because he needs to go to the gym. He\u2019s off today. The gym is open until 10 pm. But he HAS to go right when he wants to. I haven\u2019t slept well In weeks. I get no breaks. My fibromyalgia is flaring and I feel like I\u2019m being run ragged. My daughter is exclusively breastfed and hates bottles. We\u2019ve tried all different kinds. So I can\u2019t even get anyone to babysit her. Basically, he\u2019s my only lifeline and he just decides he doesn\u2019t want to help. He went literally all day without holding her or changing a diaper and that wasn\u2019t the first time. It\u2019s like whatever he wants to do comes first because I\u2019m here to take care of the baby. I\u2019ll even ask him to get the baby dressed after a bath and I\u2019ll come in and find him just holding her in her diaper with all her after bath stuff on our bed that he won\u2019t put away. It\u2019s like any form of help I get from him ends up in me having to finish it and I feel like I\u2019m going crazy. I can\u2019t ever say \u201cno\u201d to being a parent or changing diapers or holding her or spending time with her and he thinks it\u2019s perfectly normal and acceptable for him to do so because he helps when it\u2019s convenient for him. We fight all of the time and I\u2019m just so drained emotionally and physically.",

That being said, I miss my life before. I hate knowing that the rest of my life is going to be dictated by someone else. I hate trying to entertain a baby all day long. I hate that I can't eat or sleep on my own schedule.\n\nWe're just over 3 months into this journey and it's daunting to think that the rest of my life is going to be some version of this. It's odd because I love my baby but I don't feel attached to my role as mother. I know that most people super fuss over their first child, and while I have nonstop spent the last 3 months worrying about every little thing, I feel like I'm not working as hard to give my daughter the best as other FTM's would do. I almost feel like it probably seems more like she's my 2nd child rather than my first. \n\nI never wanted kids for most of my life. Then I hit 30 and my stupid biological clock kicked in and we tried for two whole years to have our baby. I was so happy and full of love and joy during pregnancy. Now, I wish I could go back and never choose this path. I tend to have a nurturing personality so I thought I would do okay at this mom thing but so far, I feel like I'm forcing myself to do something I don't want to.\n\nI feel like the worst mother in the world. I had bad baby blues the first week PP but I've been good since then. These thoughts just seem to linger in the back of my mind even though I generally feel fine most days. They seem to surface more on days I'm tired. Overall, I don't feel like I have PPD although I have considered it. I just feel like maybe I made a mistake and wish I could go back sometimes. I wish I could take a vacation from being a mom.\n\nSorry for the long post. Just needed to get this off my chest. I know I'll wake up tomorrow and keep trying my best for my daughter but it's just hard. I feel like I'm a failure and a terrible person for thinking this.",

            "selftext": "My little dude struggled with gaining weight at first, and after a bad experience with a pediatrician I decided to start supplementing formula. I sobbed while my husband fed him that first bottle. He sucked it down instead of immediately falling asleep like he did while nursing. I felt like shit, but as I realized that my baby went to bed with his tummy full and was happy I knew I did the right thing. My favorite thing about breastfeeding is how he looks up at me with his big eyes like he loves me so much. I don't know why, but I didn't expect to get that same bonded feeling while giving him a bottle. However, he still looks up at me with love because he's getting his tummy full and I'm giving him what he needs to feel better. Supplementing has helped both of us in ways I didn't expect. This is probably something you all know, but I wanted to share incase someone else is struggling the way I did.",

Anyway, I'm stressed out, on edge and exhausted after moving with a five month old baby and thus have very little patience for nonsense. \n\nI was taking a little \"break\" today going out to run errands, which included getting some essentials from Target. I got a bunch of cute clearance clothes for my daughter, but they were all \"boy\" clothes with dinosaurs and alligators and bears. \n\nWhen I went to check out, the cashier saw the clothes and said \"oh these are so sweet, are they for your son?\" Normally I would just smile and nod but for some reason today I said \"for my daughter actually!\" And the cashier looked through the pile and said \"you know these are all boy clothes, right?\" And before I could stop to think I grabbed a set of onesies and looked at the crotch and said \"oh, is there a hole for the penis or something?\" \n\nI am thoroughly embarrassed, I honestly don't know what came over me! The cashier looked like I had slapped her across the face and just finished the transaction without saying much of anything. It didn't even cross my mind that I was getting all \"boy\" clothes, I just wanted cute dinosaur onesies and alligator overalls for my baby! I feel like I can't go back until that cashier quits now haha.",

My reasoning for it is because I need to get ready for work in the morning. As long as your child is in a safe spot, nothing is in the area that can be hazardous, you check up on them every once in a while, it\u2019s fine! Give them a few cool toys, and, maybe, even put a little tv on if you want. \n\nI\u2019m aware there are some babies who just can\u2019t be put down because they\u2019ll cry and freak out, which I get, but there are some new mothers who don\u2019t put their babies down by themselves anywhere ever, because they feel guilty doing it, like if they\u2019re not entertaining their baby 24/7 they\u2019re a bad mom.",

I explained that he was in a leap, got a quizzical look, so I opened the wonder weeks app on my phone to show him a brief chart of when you can expect babies to be more or less fussy to get a bit of a heads up of what to expect. \n\nTo which he replied \"I don't know, sounds like super boring mom stuff \" \n\nAnd we changed the topic. At first I was pretty sorry for bug in him and being boring but.....now that I think back on it, is just attended a grad party for him, spent quite a while congratulating him and talking about his work and accomplishments. But he can't muster 5minutes of give a damn for my daily? Thanks bud. \n\nThis from the guy who says he wants \"like 10 kids\".

He is hungry and angry, and I think that's my fault because I am upset and it's making him upset. \n\nEarlier in the day my mother in law did something that made me so angry, that I haven't been able to stop crying. \n\nI am nursing in the living room while talking to MIL. We are 20 minutes deep into talking about a TV show when she moves from her spot across from me, lifts up the blanket I am using to cover me and my LO, PHYSICALLY pulls my breast out of LO mouth, and scoops him up in what seemed like one swift motion.\n\nI was shocked. It happened in less then 2 seconds. I immediately said, what the fuck are you doing?! To which she said, what? Grandma needs her baby time too.\n\nI am not proud of saying I kinda just sat in silence for a minute, I genuinely thought I got something wrong. I then told her it was not ok to take my baby or touch my boobs. All I go was, oh honey you lost the right to your boobs when you decided to breastfeed. You can't get upset, one day I'll have tits bigger than yours. In any case, I only get to see him once a day.\n\nI just started crying. I left to go cry in the kitchen where she couldn't see me, but I could keep an eye out on LO.\n\nWhen DH came home, she accused me of being homophobic because how dare I acuse her of being pervy. \n\n\nI tried posting twice on JustNoMIL, but my posts we're removed because I gave the backstory of how my MIL is trans. What sucks is that it really is important to how I feel, but some people got really butt hurt about it. I am accepting of her, but it's so uncomfortable having someone who has a beard, dresses like a man, dates women, touch my breasts and want to talk about my body all the time. She was obsessed with my pregnancy, and would not keep her hands to herself. People thought she was my husband, it sucked. \n\nI am a jumbled mess of feeling. Thank you for listening",

I walk into the exam room with him and take my jacket off and the nurse says \"Oh! Are you expecting another!?\" with a giant shit eating grin on her face. No, nurse for babies. I had my kid, who is in front of you, 4 months ago and apparently look fat and terrible and still pregnant. Thanks, like I didn't know. I had to just look at her and say \"No, Im just still fat.\"  She is middle aged and a woman. What the fuck is the excuse? Well, now my self esteem is in the toilet. I've been trying to eat healthy and exercise and be kind to myself. I have had issues with disordered eating my whole life. Why do people feel the need to comment on my appearance? On my body?

We split up 4 months into my pregnancy and he was absent during the rest of my pregnancy. After she was born, I would drive her to see him once or twice a week \u2014 he lives an hour away and doesn\u2019t drive.  I thought it was important for her to bond with her dad even if he wasn\u2019t around much. But it became exhausting. He never helped pay for gas, he would never come see her at my house even if I paid for Ubers, he always had some lame excuse as to why he couldn\u2019t come over and spend the day taking care of his daughter. \n\nI became more and more resentful and finally decided if he wanted to see her, he should come here. I\u2019d even still pay for the Uber. He wouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s been two weeks and he hasn\u2019t asked to see his daughter at all or offered to help pay for her. \n\nSo, I filed for child support today. My daughter deserves it. I wanted her to have a father but I guess that\u2019s just not in the cards right now and that\u2019s ok. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m expecting by writing this, maybe hearing from other single moms, or maybe just having people to talk to. \n\nThanks for reading &lt;3",

I had one more stop to make, just to the grocery store to grab a few things but I didn\u2019t want him crying the whole time so I thought you know what? I can just feed him here in the car, breastfeeding has been getting easier for us and he feeds quick now, I\u2019ll just pop him on real quick before we go inside. So I park in the back of the parking lot, get all settled with him in the backseat and get to nursing, not two minutes later he lets out the biggest poop, followed by two more huge poops, blowing out his diaper and up his back. I was like ohhhh you had to poop not hungry!!! Hahahah With no where else to change him but there I stripped him down naked in the backseat and did a full outfit change. Good thing I had an extra outfit, not good it was a 0-3 and suuuuper tight but it did the trick. I was sweating by the time I got him cleaned, changed and back in his seat, him smiling at me the whole time. We got out groceries and went home. End of story. ",

            "selftext": "I\u2019ve read a lot of posts by newborn moms/parents  about their husband not helping with baby as much or without prompting, but I want to know how things are past that age. Tell me your schedules. \n\nI\u2019m having a hard time showing my husband that he needs to help more. In his mind, he loves his daughter and works from home so he spends \u201cplenty of time\u201d with her. I\u2019ve never kept numerical track of things to show him that his perception is skewed. This is the reality: besides greeting him with baby in the morning, I feed, change, play, teach and put baby to sleep. He works from 8am-4pm upstairs while I take baby to her classes and playgrounds and give him privacy. She is a poor napper (45 mins each x2) and I usually get dinner started during one nap and tidy up during another. He gets off work at 4 and leaves the house to run errands (house renovation is ongoing but he always found \u201cerrands\u201d to do before renovations started in 2019). \n\nWhen he comes back around 7pm, he plays with her for 15-20 mins until I shower with her and hand her off to him to get her dried up and into pajamas to go to bed. Then I put her to sleep and lay next to her, come down and eat dinner and we both zone out on our books/phones. Can you tell our marriage sucks? \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m selfish for asking to go on a date every now and then. It\u2019s led to such severe fights that I stopped asking. Since our daughter was born a year ago we went on 2 short dates, both coordinated by me. May 2018 and October 2018. We don\u2019t have any intimacy. \n\nOn the weekends he sleeps in, plays basketball or goes to bible study. I repeat the same weekday schedule starting at 8am, no weekends for me. He may play more with her on Saturday if the weather is bad but never solo, always next to me. He feeds her fruit sometimes. He has taken her with him to do grocery shopping when I\u2019ve thrown an occasional fit about not having time to even poop alone (baby is not into independent play when poop calls). But then he acts like he did me the biggest favor for being gone an hour and also asks how productive I was while he was gone so I feel pressure to make sure a few home organization projects get done anytime he does me this grand favor. \n\nHe has not cooked for me or baby in over 365 days. He has never done a late night with her. He has never put her to sleep himself. He was unsupportive with sleep training except to tell me what he feels I am doing wrong (no, he doesn\u2019t research anything). \n\nWhen I ask him to watch baby so that I can do something away from home (get eyebrow done, dye my grey hairs) he always asks me to reschedule to another day so that he can handle some business first. As if spending time with her takes massive preparation and he needs to handle other priorities first.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t want to attend couples counseling because he thinks we need to work things out on our own but he sucks at talking sensitively (he told me this morning that I shouldn\u2019t be so weak in front of our daughter. Weak is not an appropriate word to use). He also doesn\u2019t want things to be sprung on him in front of a stranger(counselor). I feel unsupported, burnt out and low, I am  going to attend a postpartum center\u2019s counseling session on my own. When I try to express that I need more help or need more alone time from him,  he tells me to lean on my abusive mom or drive an hour away to my in laws. I can\u2019t leave her with my in laws too long cause baby won\u2019t take bottles, only boob and they also don\u2019t know how to soothe her and just complain about how I\u2019ve made her too attached to me (they are anti breastfeeding and blame it for the attachment). My baby has dropped a few nursing sessions but still wants to nurse every 4 hours even though she eats bowls and bowls of food (babyled weaning style).\n\nThanks for listening to me vent. Please tell me how to get my life together. Please tell me if I\u2019m right to feel like husband needs to spend more caretaking time with our baby. ",

            "selftext": "Since a week or so my husband has became more and more frustrated with our now 13-day old daughter. \n\n\nShe is the sweetest baby ever. She never cries, only if she's hungry. I'm so happy with her and the fact that she's so content and quietly sleeps in her crib. \n\n\nAt night, she wakes us up for food. We don't get up to feed her at special times. We let her decide when she wants to be fed. This means we wake up to a crying baby and I go prepare the bottle and feed her. \n\n\nSince a week he's become more and more angry everytime she cries at night. He slams doors, comes downstairs and starts ranting to me whilst I'm preparing her bottle. He keeps using the words \"this child\", \"this baby\", etc. Instead of just using her name. He says the crying drives him nuts. He also becomes angry with me if I don't finish quick enough. He will make cheeky comments. I told him I don't appreciate it and it makes me feel like shit. The comments he makes make me feel like I'm not a good mother. After 5 to 10 mins of ranting he apologizes and goes back to sleep. \n\n\nJust yesterday he did a feeding and was doing a burp with her. She had a little milk come up and because she was on his shoulder, he got soaked with the milk. He instantly got pissed off and started calling her \"idiot\", \"retard\", and other hurtful names. I got really pissed and told him to never call our daughter that. \n\n\nA few nights ago he said \"this cancer baby keeps crying\". I'm so hurt and devastated. I can't believe he's saying these things about our daughter. \n\n\nDuring the day he is calm most of the time and reassures me that he loves her and he does a lot of her care during the day. But I'm scared that this hatred at night will become worse and might turn violent towards me or the baby and I just can't cope with it anymore. I feel like a shitty mother, a shitty wife and just a terrible person in general. \n\n\nWhat can I do? I'm so broken by this situation. ",

I absolutely agree that nobody should be shamed for breast vs bottle or SAHM vs working mum or medicated vs ummedicated birth. Those are personal choices - in some cases *intimate* personal choices - with lots of complicated factors playing into them. Nobody should be required to justify or explain their choice. So far so good.\n\nBut people, there are some parenting choices that *should* be judged. I'm talking about things like leaving an infant to scream until it vomits, or getting high while in sole charge of a baby, or a \"cute\" picture of a baby getting right in the face of a clearly very stressed dog. \n\nEven when a behaviour is unambiguously neglectful, cruel or dangerous, anything other than  \"there's no right or wrong\" or \"you know your baby best\" or \"happy mummy, happy baby\" is met with torches and pictchforks and \"How dare you judge my parenting choices?\"\n\nIt's stupid. It's harmful. Why are we (not this board specifically but online mum groups in general) encouraging the idea that absolutely any way of treating a baby is acceptable? Or is it that mums are too delicate and fragile to tolerate any criticism or dissent, however necessary? Can we have a dialogue about this? Because it's driving me insane.",

We live in Australia and it was 34C/93F today, with no breeze. He was not by any stretch cold. She kept wrapping him in flannel blankets and insisting he was cold. \n\nAfter a few gentle reminders I removed the flannel blanket and repeated the mantra my health nurses drilled into me \"Cold babies cry, hot babies die. He's not cold.\"\n\nShe pushed the baby into my arms and huffed. \"I suppose I was just a terrible mother then.\"\n\nSick of her crap, I replied \"I guess.\"\n\nI'll pay for that, but man, it was satisfying.

            "selftext": "My 17 month old gets car sick. It sucks, for her and for us. Last time we made the drive to her Grandpa's place, she threw up twice. That means being on a roadside somewhere doing full outfits changes, trying to clean vomit out of the ten thousand nooks and crannies in the car seat, while comforting her and helping her walk it off. Makes the trip take ages, and it's exhausting.\n\nWhen this first started happening, I did a bunch of research. There's not that much you can do until they are old enough to face forward (except drive carefully, which we do). But one thing that has a big impact is heat. I got carsick a lot as a kid and I definitely remember needing cool air on me.\n\nSo, when we were all loading in the car, I took my kid's pants off and just put her in the car seat in her onesie. I explained to my mom that it's important she doesn't get too warm as it leads to carsickness. It was a warm day, so much that we had the AC on in the car. \n\nWe carefully timed everything so her naptime would come just before we go over the mountains. My husband and I are in the front with our fingers crossed, and my mom's in the back. Like a god damn miracle the toddler actually goes to sleep! At the right time! If she sleeps through, we are on the express right past vomit city!\n\nNext thing, I see my mom reaching over to touch her. I don't even know why. I turned around, looked her straight in the eye, and whispered furiously, \"do. not. touch. her.\" My mom rolls her eyes like I'm being silly. But I stared her down and she backed off.\n\nTwo minutes later, I hear a bunch of rustling. My mom is taking her jacket out of her bag. The unnecessary noise was making me grit my teeth, but I figured ok, my mom might be cold, whatever. But then she starts putting her jacket over my daughter! WTF WHAT DID I JUST SAY?\n\nMy husband see in the rearview mirror and says \"take it off\". My mom keeps tucking it around her and I can tell it's disturbing her sleep already, so I turn around and whisper-yell \"what are you doing? take that off her!\" She tried to argue back about oh no she's cold blah blah, and I just snapped \"take it the fuck off right now.\" Then she starts trying to tell us to turn the AC off. I again stared her in the eye and whispered \"no. Now be quiet.\" Like, I don't enjoy talking to my mom like she's a toddler herself, but what the fuck did she expect?? Thankfully she took the jacket back and STFU or there would have been a highway murder.\n\n(\u256f\u00b0\u25a1\u00b0\uff09\u256f\ufe35 \u253b\u2501\u253b\n\nThank the sleep gods, the baby did not wake up. She slept over the mountains and when I got her out, her temperature was perfectly fine.\n\nWhat the fuck. My husband and I have been with our kid every single day for 17 months. We have done this drive multiple times. And we are her PARENTS FFS. We're generally very laid back, but when it comes to our baby's health and safety, what we say GOES. How the fuck is this even a discussion? I would never in a million years tell someone else what's best for their kid, much less defy their direct instructions.\n\nAhhhh thanks for letting me vent. ",

            "selftext": "My cousin's wife, who I adore, has been posting articles, illustrations, quotes, etc. about \"natural\" birth for the last few weeks. My LO turned 9 months over the weekend and I thought I was over the birth but, apparently, I'm not because every time I see these bullshit articles I want to scream.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI really really really wanted an intervention-free vaginal birth. I heard about how magical it was and I wanted to be able to experience those first few moments as my baby entered this world, I wanted to hold him on my chest and smell his head and cry all the tears. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI listened to so many birth stories. My husband and I took a Bradley class. I got Chiropractic. Acupuncture. A freaking Doula. We had a midwifery team. I did prenatal yoga, spinning babies, breathing exercises, Hypnobirthing, ate super healthy, denied cervical checks, EVERYTHING that was supposedly supposed to guarantee a \"normal, natural vaginal birth\". I bought into everything about how a natural birth was the best thing you could do for your baby. About how empowered and strong you were if you had a natural birth. And worst of all, that if you didn't do it naturally it was probably your fault for not doing your homework.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, I ended up with an excruciating emergency c-section after 27 hours of labor, and every intervention in between. IV, epidural, something to stop my uterus from hypercontracting, pitocin to restart my contractions, oxygen, antinausea meds, and finally fentanyl after they discovered the epidural wasn't working during my c-section. Baby's head was not facing forwards or backwards, he was diagonal instead. And he was just too freaking big. But the thing is, I shouldn't have to justify WHY I had a c-section. I shouldn't feel bad because natural birth isn't actually attainable for everyone. But instead of feeling lucky for surviving pregnancy and birth, I feel robbed, guilty, and weak.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNatural birth advocates say they are \"empowering\" women. But I just wish having a natural birth wasn't the only way to be empowered. Next time I give birth, whether I have another c-section, or I'm induced, or I go intervention-free, I want to feel empowered for GROWING AND BIRTHING A HUMAN because that in and of itself is a feat.

            "selftext": "Today, I decided to go to Target for the first time since giving birth. I wait until LO wakes up and eats so I know he will nap through it. I feed him and put on a cute fresh outfit, pack his stuff up nicely in the diaper bag, and we are on our way. Target is about 20 minutes from our house so I figure I could have a solid hour to just be normal and browse Target again for once.\n\nHa.\nHa ha ha.\n\nLO sleeps the whole way there so I am way too overconfident and so proud that my plan is working. The second we cross the threshold of the door to Target this little behemoth wakes up screaming. I give him the pacifier and he is fine... for now. I grab a few shirts since nothing I own fits me anymore. Cue LO spitting the pacifier across the aisle and screaming bloody murder.\n\nI leave the clothes with the only person running the checkout line (wtf Target). Because they only keep the self checkout open now apparently. I run to the bathroom thinking he needs to have a diaper change. He\u2019s still crying after being changed so I go towards the dressing room to try feeding him again.\n\nHe eats like he\u2019s never eaten in his life and finally I think we\u2019re gonna be okay. I decide to leave while I\u2019m ahead and go back to where I left the clothes with the only open attendant. Of course the woman ahead of me in line is trying to do 85 separate transactions and the poor guy doesn\u2019t know how, so has to have another employee come from across the store to help.\n\nLO starts screaming again so I take him out of the stroller and rock him back and forth. A nice elderly couple behind me start talking to me about him, asking how old he is, saying he\u2019s so adorable. Just as the older woman moves closer to take a better look, he poops.\n\nNot just any poop, though. An explosive, wet, stanky diarrhea poop. And this kid poops LOUD. It sounds like a grown man farting.\n\nIt\u2019s my turn to pay now so I put him down in the stroller. I swipe my card and look down. My shirt is covered in poop. Covered. Not that I\u2019m trying to find a man right now, plus I\u2019m married and would never lol, but the cashier was attractive and this is my first solo mom trip out to a \u201cnormal\u201d place and I am now covered in shit.\n\nI look at LO and he is smiling peacefully in the stroller, also covered in poo. We make it out to the car and I just change him on the backseat. All the while he is now snoring, passed out, with a huge grin on his face.\n\nI go to the furthest parking space under a tree so I can change into one of the new shirts I got so I don\u2019t have to drive home in baby diarrhea.\n\nTarget, please explain to me why a size Medium no longer fits me!? I know I\u2019m only 6 weeks post partum but I\u2019m still quite petite and this is a normal effing t-shirt from the women\u2019s section.... I swear this shirt is like a crop top for a teenager! Wtf is going on?! I could probably get an XL and it would be too small after shrinking in the wash one time!\n\nI bought quite a few shirts since they were cheap and didn\u2019t know when I would be able to make it back, and now I will have to drive all the way back some day soon and exchange them all!\n\nSo anyways. We made it home finally after he woke up the second the car got onto the freeway and screamed the whole way. I guess this is the mom life now, huh?",

            "selftext": "Story time: I was in Target today picking up formula with my daughter in tow. A woman in the aisle with me asked how old baby was. Harmless enough. I told her she was just shy of three months. The woman gets really quiet, looks and me and says, \u201cHoney, you know breastfeeding is way better for her than THAT (gestures to formula in my basket) stuff.\u201d \n\nI struggled really hard with breastfeeding. We had a lot of obstacles in our way including a bad latch, low supply, and my kid\u2019s milk allergy. I tried just about everything to ensure breastfeeding would work - vitamins, teas, multiple lactation consultants - but in the end, it wasn\u2019t meant to be. And that devastated me. It took me a long time to come to peace with my decision to quit, and honestly, I sometimes still struggle with it. \n\nI\u2019m more than happy to talk about my experience with people who ask because I think being honest about how hard motherhood can be is important, and I was about to share this with this random stranger in Target when I realized, I OWE HER NOTHING. I don\u2019t need to explain my choices to her. So, I told a lie.\n\nI calmly looked this woman in the eye and said, \u201cActually, I had to have a double mastectomy last year and can\u2019t breastfeed.\u201d I have NEVER seen someone\u2019s face turn redder than hers did in that moment. \n\nShe sputtered \u201csorry,\u201d and scurried down the aisle and out of sight. Was it wrong to lie? Yeah. But maybe, just maybe, this woman will think next time before she questions the way another woman decides to feed her child. Everyone has a different story and different reason for the parenting decisions they make. Just because their journey or choice is different from yours does not make it wrong. You want to formula feed because you feel it\u2019s more convenient? Awesome. You think breastfeeding is a better choice for you because you think it will help you bond? Go you! You want to exclusively pump so you have more freedom? YASS, QUEEN! At the end of the day is your kid fed and loved? Yes? GREAT. THAT is the goal...nothing else.\n\nStop mommy-shaming. Let\u2019s support each other, ladies.",

I have made numerous phone calls, sent emails, etc. and busting my ass for my disability to be approved. I called the disability company today only to speak with a hateful, hateful man who yelled at me when I asked for clarification on what type of medical records he needed for my disability to be approved. \n\nIt\u2019s so unfair. We are the ONLY industrialized country without ANY type of paid maternity leave and the paid leave we DO get is a pain in the ass to receive. How am I supposed to be a mother, recover from c section, recover from PPD, pay my 20,000$ hospital bill, while taking UNPAID maternity leave and somehow not go insane? This is ridiculous and I hope I see the day when maternity leave is a right and not a privilege... ",

            "selftext": "Yesterday I went to kohl\u2019s to buy my son new clothes. There were racks, tables and walls full of the most beautiful Easter and spring themed clothes... for girls. Dresses, onesies, overalls, pant and shirt, short and shirt, and footies in every color of the rainbow. \n\nCute prints with bunnies, kitties, carrots, squirrels and bees. I saw at least three different bunny pockets. \n\nOver on the boys section, the same selection I have seen for the last year. Black, blue and gray boy clothes. Plaid shirts with shorts. Work-themed and monsters. The only Easter clothes I found did have a bunny but it was.... blue.\n\nLet me make some things clear: I don\u2019t wish I\u2019d had a daughter, I love my little man to pieces. I don\u2019t subscribe to gender stereotypes as a girl who grew up with two brothers (people used to shame me for wanting to play with them (???)) I don\u2019t want to put a dress on my son but I am sick and tired of the dull clothes available to him.\n\nWhy were there no orange, yellow, red clothes with some fuzzy animals? Why does it have to be about jobs or monsters exclusively?\n\nI posted the clothes on Snapchat showing the discrepancy and one of my male relatives replied: \u201cbunnies are not for boys. Get you a lil girl\u201d\n\nI disagree. Bunnies are for boys. Why are they already being forced to be \u201cmanly\u201d? Would some Easter bunnies take away from his \u201cmanliness\u201d? He is only six months old.\n\nPlease let me know how you feel about this.",

And this country is the worst when it comes to supporting new mothers. And worst of all I feel guilty because I\u2019m actually way better off than a lot of new moms. \n\nI\u2019m just sad. For all of it. I don\u2019t want to leave my baby yet. \n\nI know you guys understand... not looking for a miracle here just wanted to put it out in the reddit-verse how much this sucks (mostly because if I here one more person say it\u2019ll be okay I\u2019ll lose my shit.... I know it will, but it can still be really freaking hard for me)\n\nAnyways... thanks for coming to my pity party\ud83d\ude18",

We don't really have any family members that we trust enough who can watch our little man. So it makes going out just the two of us not an option right now. \n\nBut last night my SO came home from work and decided we should go out to dinner somewhere, and we'll just take our little man with us. Which made me super nervous because we'd never done that before. I also didn't want to be that couple that brings a baby to a restaurant and gets dirty looks from fellow patrons. (I've read to many stories about people complaining that babies get brought to restaurants.)\n\nI decided to just ignore that little voice in my head because it's been so long since we've been somewhere nicer to seat down and eat. So we went out to a nice Chinese buffet near us. As a little family of three, and it actually went really smoothly.\n\nOur little man sat in a high chair and made friends with our waitress and a lady sitting next to us. Heck. Little man waved back at someone for the very first time and that made us both as parents super excited. Granted near the end there it was an hour before bedtime and our little man was getting restless but there wasn't any crying or screaming. Just annoyed baby noises, and no one seemed to give two shits.\n\nIt felt really good to go out for dinner as a family, and to not get annoyed looks from other patrons because we brought a baby along. Some part of me just assumed people would get annoyed by us and our little man. But nope, it all went down really smoothly and I just wanted to share a little post about our success.",

Especially since we live in Japan away from all of our family. But what am I supposed to DO with the stuffed zoo she has? Bears in every size and color! My neighbor brought her a STUFFED MT. FUJI.

            "selftext": "My youngest is almost two. Our family is complete. We have no plans to add another. So I feel like if I am still pissed about FMLA and how it fails families all the time, I'm allowed. There's a family bill being proposed in the house to help with maternity leave (paternity leave too I think). So with that facebook has become busy with memes, text pictures relating to FMLA.\n\nI have no problem with child-free people commenting on their views. I have no problem with men commenting on their views. Honestly, most of these people have a family member or friend who started a family recently and knows their loved one's struggle. However, when I get an ass-hat telling me to stop being emotional in my post I get a little livid. 1) It was a fact based text post. Literally had a source sited. 2) I worked in HR for 2 years. It fails women ALL THE TIME. It's literally just job protection for 12 weeks to full time benefit eligible employees. When there is a new mother in my department, they all come to me asking questions because I know all the BS HR doesn't want you to know regarding our benefits and how to take advantage out of everything you can. With my 2nd I had STD (short term disability) since with my first, I was asked to stop working at 34 weeks. I didn't have my baby until week 41 of my pregnancy. Well our short term disability doesn't start until 12 weeks after the incident occurs (delivery in their language). So I literally paid in for nothing with that. I also had to pay into insurance for one month otherwise my coverage would lapse. This ass hat. I can't even tell you. I didn't even need to comment because so many other women started commenting with their stories of how FMLA failed them. It's just job protection. In no way is it a support feature for mothers/fathers and babies- if you think it is - gtfo. EMOTIONAL. EMOTIONAL. YA GODDAMN RIGHT I'M A LITTLE EMOTIONAL WHEN YOU SAY I'M BEING EMOTIONAL. Now, I just really want him to tell me to \"Calm down\" even though I haven't commented a response. :'D",

My MIL asked when we planned to with our LO and was surprised that we were taken aback. Why pierce an infant's ears? How can you insist it doesn't hurt them? Oh they won't remember it and that makes it better? What if she doesnt want holes in her ears or doesnt care for earrings? I don't get it. I categorize piercings with tattoos and anything else you'd do to modify your body as you'd like. Unless my child can vocalize the want for this and understand to some degree about the process, who am I to make that decision for her? Maybe I am just a hormonal millennial new mom who is 'woke' to the whole 'that's what we did and it turned out fine' mentality.",

            "selftext": "It\u2019s been nine months since spawnlet was born (c section, yelling, red, and perfect).\n\nSo! Here are nine things I\u2019ve learned being a mom. \n\n1) I\u2019ve never regretted attachment parenting. Not for one second. Best decision ever. No CIO, breastfeeding on demand, baby wearing. \n\n2) Not every baby likes food. The food pickiness can be REAL. Some days Spawnlet will eat 2oz of pur\u00e9es and some days not even a tiny spoonful will make it past the iron gates of spawnlet\u2019s gummy smile.\n\n3) I truly do love Spawnlet more than I\u2019ve ever loved another human being. Reason: baby turds.  Smashed baby turds. Having to clean smashed baby turds in the middle of a meal because Spawnlet decided to poop and roll. \n\n4) Momming is a job where everyone is a critic and an expert regardless of their experience level. It\u2019s like being an engineer and your accountant friend decides to tell you how to repair an engine with tax files. As a mom, with hours of research and literally 24/7 caring for my baby, I\u2019ve had maybe 5272738 people ready to give their opinion on what I\u2019m doing wrong/what I should do different  - even if none of them have kids. I\u2019ve had maybe 2 people tell me I\u2019m  a great mom. I\u2019ll remember those two people forever. \n\n5) Naps are important. Spawnlet is visibly smarter after a nap to rest the little grey cells. Do not underestimate the importance of naps. \n\n6) Spawnlet will do things in Spawnlet\u2019s own time. Babies have a very loose interpretation of time. No one told them about milestones and the fact they should be sitting at 3 months or walking at 10 (I know these aren\u2019t the real numbers).\n\n7) Nothing makes me melt faster than Spawnlet\u2019s everything. Everything is cute, when it\u2019s Spawnlet. I\u2019m almost embarrassed to say it. Discipline is HARD when that pout is so darn cute. \n\n8) Being a mom changed me. Boundaries became Important. Everything matters when it comes to Spawnlet. Decisions are made with Spawnlet as a number 1 priority. That\u2019s not to say I don\u2019t care about anything else, but I PRIORITISE. And I could not care less about anyone\u2019s opinion who thinks that\u2019s a bad thing. \n\n9) Coffee makes me a better mom. \n\nMy first Reddit post - Much love to all the mamas reading this. I would love to hear some of the things you\u2019ve learned while momming!! :) ",

Currently no one in the family has measles, but now there's a full-blown measles outbreak in my area AND IT'S PISSING ME OFF. There's been at least 55 deaths, mostly young children, and the number of measles cases compared to the same time last year increased by 550%. Of course, one of the main causes for this is the drop in vaccinations due to some local issues and misinformation that eroded public trust in vaccines in general.\n\nIt's so frustrating! I don't understand! I mean I'd like to believe parents do what they think is best for their kids, but how can anyone believe THIS is the best for them?\n\nAlso, another annoyance: people who don't care that other people are unvaccinated as long as their own children are, since \"it's just the people who don't vaccinate who'll be affected\". NO! My baby who's too young to be vaccinated is affected! So are immunocompromised people! Pregnant women! People who got vaccinated but for one reason or another didn't get immunity! HERD IMMUNITY FUCKING MATTERS AND YOU SHOULD CARE ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE DAMMIT.\n\n(Eagerly waiting for my baby to turn six months next month so he can get the MMR shot. In the meantime, no excursions first. Again.)",

They want a video chat daily and I just think it's insane they expect this. I'm trying to enjoy my precious time with my baby while I'm on maternity leave.  We have a mommy and me bootcamp twice a week and a nursery rhyme class too. I'm busy and I'm enjoying it but I get stressed to have 4 missed video chat calls and constant texts about \"Please call back when you can, thanks.\"\n\nI have no problem calling them on my own terms. They dont know our schedule. I feel so guilty- it comes from a place of love. My own parents see my baby once a week and they live 10 minutes away.  Someone give me the truth. Am I unreasonable? Usually I let my husband do the calls at night because they're his parents. They both recently retired as well so they're home all day. I just dont want them to think I am \"withholding\" baby on a spiteful level. I just get exhausted talking to them (overbearing) so I really need time between calls to recharge. ",

            "selftext": "I may get downvoted to death for this but there's something that happens semi frequently here that really gets my goat. \n\nI understand the conventional guidelines are that bed sharing is to be avoided (at least in the US and to a lesser extent the UK) but to say that it is based in the research without taking account of the factors in each case is simply not true.\n\nI have a 4 month old. We bedshare and have done since I brought her home. It was something I never thought we would do when I was pregnant. She wouldn't settle one night and a midwife on the postnatal ward talked me through it while saying she couldn't strictly recommended it. I love research. I'm a Msc student, a former midwifery student. So I did the research.\n\nWhat \"we\" (and by we I mean judgy healthcare professionals and people on the internet) are telling women is incorrect and profoundly unhelpful. Telling women they will roll over and kill their baby is unhelpful. God only knows we get judged enough and these voices cause women to stay silent and not seek out safe bed sharing guidelines.\n\nIf your baby is breastfed and was born at term, if you do not smoke and have not drunk. If you are in bed and not on a sofa. If you are not excessively tired or on drugs or particular medication there is no statistically significant risk. In fact being so close encourages breastfeeding, regulates temperature and breathing, some research found it may decrease the risk of sids.\n\nPrevious UK data suggests: \n\u25a0 around half of SIDS babies die while sleeping in a cot or Moses basket. \n\u25a0 around half of SIDS babies die while co-sleeping. \nHowever, 90% of these babies \ndied in hazardous situations which are largely preventable.\n\nDo not come at women with guidelines not based on current research and try to terrify women.\n\nIf you are interested UNICEF has some great resources and information here:\nhttps://www.unicef.org.uk/babyfriendly/news-and-research/baby-friendly-research/infant-health-research/infant-health-research-bed-sharing-infant-sleep-and-sids/\n\nOkay sorry if I seem rude just feel very strongly about it \ud83d\udc9c\n\nP.s. This is not at all to say people should not comment safety concerns on posts, if done non judgementally if is extremely helpful and quite frankly needed in some cases",

A million and one things to do with feeding, diapers, gas pains, sleeping (and not sleeping)... and then you walk by the kitchen sink in a sleepless daze and see the ever growing pile of bottles and bottle parts. The thought of washing them (why do they have SO MANY tiny crevices?!?) makes you ill. The fact that you have to do this 3 times a day every single day makes you seriously consider buying 1000 bottles and just tossing them after you use them.\n\nEvery time my brother in law came to visit, he would say hello, roll up his sleeves, and start washing. Never asked, ignored our protests, just washed every single piece so thoroughly. I almost cried the first time I saw that glorious pile of clean bottles. He later told us that he remembered how much he HATED washing bottles when his first was born and he wanted to help make that part of our lives easier. Now that their second is due in a few weeks, I can't wait to repay the favor!",

            "selftext": "This has been on my mind for a few days. Someone posted their opinion about formula feeding being absolutely fine recent. She included some articles that proved that breastfeeding isnt the \"be all, end all\" of parenthood. She was kind to everyone that commented.\n\nMost of the comments were appreciative and supportive, some not so much. Either way, it stuck with me. I really want to share my opinions because I know that there have to be others that feel similarly, and I would have loved to see this when pregnant. I'm writing from a throwaway because I guess I still feel a bit judged, and I'm ANNOYED that I feel that way. So it's important for me to share.\n\nSo... My story: \n\nI had zero interest in breastfeeding. It just honestly didn't appeal to me. I never judged or cared when people breastfed in public. It's just not my thing. So, when I got pregnant, it was one of the first things I stressed about. I have anxiety and a history of some light depression. Being pregnant meant switching meds. I switched to something safe to take while pregnant. The thing is, though, is that I had no interest in breastfeeding even if the anxiety and depression weren't an issue. I just didn't want to. My husband and I talked about and did some research. The benefits did not outweigh any risks for us. We decided to formula feed from day 1.\n\nEarly on, I was judged. A friend \"shared\" her experience with me. Except it wasn't just sharing. It was talking about the \"amazing bonding\" experience she had. How I could still take meds while breastfeeding. How she didn't want me to regret it later on. How it was the one thing she loved during those difficult newborn times. How it always calmed her son. \n\nAt EVERY Dr appt, they asked about it. I eventually got annoyed and told them to write a note on my record that my mind was made up. They never did. I continued to be asked about it and told the benefits. My midwife pointed it out at every chance she could. She commented, during my labor, that my dress was a nursing dress. I did not care and still was not planning on nursing. I had to bring my own formula and bottles. They provided nothing. \n\nI was given ZERO guidance on how to feed. My daughter lost weight those first two days because we did not know to increase how much she was eating! No one told me until I got into the pediatrician for the first time. \n\nI struggled and had to figure it out on my own, because I was offered no support. \n\nMy friend who gave birth around the same time decided to breastfeed and was given support from day 1. She had her own struggles for sure, and she did amazingly, but I saw the difference, and I never talked about it. I knew she had it difficult and I had no one to relate to, so I just let it all go. \n\nI'm sharing now for other moms. \n\nFormula feeding was the only thing that kept me sane. Once I figured it out (on my own), my daughter's newborn days were awesome. She was fed, slept amazingly early on, gaijned weight beautifully, met all of her milestones. Pacifiers calmed her. My husband and I took the nights in shifts. We bonded with her when we fed her and when we cuddled. I have zero regrets about my decision. To be honest, I feel like part of the reason my daughter was such an easy baby is because of how she was fed. \n\nAt 13 months, she's walking, she's saying words, she's rarely sick and close to both my husband and I, and her grandparents. Life is good. \n\n\nWith this being said, I completely understand that this is just what worked for MY family, and that not everyone is the same. Breastfeeding HAS benefits. Just do what YOU want. Those benefits really don't matter down the line. They just don't. They aren't worth your sanity. Studies show that it makes no difference after 2 years old, and the difference before then are miniscule (at least for an at term baby). \n\nThe reason that I posted this is because it was actually pretty easy to find posts saying \"I tried to breastfeed but couldn't and formula is ok!\" but it was really hard to find posts that said \"I didn't want to breastfeed from day 1 so I didn't\". I want moms to know that that's also a valid choice. It worked for me, and I kind of think that it needs to be said more often (maybe if it were, I would have avoided some of my difficulties early on). \n\nIf you are breastfeeding, good for you. It's hard and I have the utmost respect for you doing it. If you are formula feeding, it's more than just \"OK\", as well. You are feeding your baby, and loving them, and taking care of them. \n\nIt does not matter. Really. By the time they are a toddler, youll catch them with dog food in their mouth (or whatever the equivalent is in your house). \n",

In the case of low birthweight, or premature babies these risks compound with existing risks. \n\nSo before turning up your nose and saying \u201cbreast is best\u201d to the mother formula feeding her child, think about the fact that it may not have been her choice to formula feed, maybe she feels like a failure for not being able to provide enough nutrition for her baby and maybe the baby is only alive due to the miracle of formula.\n\nI tried my motherfucking damndest to exclusively breast feed my baby, but because of supply issues, my own health (lost too much blood during delivery) my breast was NOT best for my baby. \n\nI am so thankful that my baby is getting all the nutrients he needs from formula.  \n\nIf you can breast feed, and enjoy it, do it.\n\nIf not, don\u2019t tell some poor mom who\u2019s newborn is starving and just out of the NICU that \u201cbreast is better\u201d \n\n[1]: [Everybody Calm Down About Breastfeeding](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/everybody-calm-down-about-breastfeeding/)\n[2]:  [Dangers of Insufficient Exclusive Breastfeeding](https://fedisbest.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Dangers-of-Insufficient-Exclusive-Breastfeeding.pdf)",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone!  It's been quite awhile.  I had my first kiddo back in Feb. 2016 and my second in Nov. 2017.  When my youngest was first born, I was here quite a bit.  Lately I've been thinking about you all.  I'd like to give a little, possibly controversial, PSA.\n\nFrom the day my oldest was born, he wasn't a particularly happy child.  He cried a lot and cried even harder when I held him.  Before we left the hospital, we were telling friends and family that he was an 'independent babe'.  By his 5th day of life, he would eat and then go stiff and scream for up to an hour at a time.  It took us months to realize he had a milk protein intolerance.  Our pediatrician only took us seriously when he started pooping blood.\n\nHe hated sneezing.  The first time he sneezed, he screamed right after.  A hilarious and primal scream.  He would do this every time he sneeze.  But would be inconsolable if someone else sneezed.  When he was about 2 weeks old, I left him alone with my husband.  My mom was visiting.  She and I made a 10 minute drive to KFC.  When we got home, I could hear him screaming from the driveway.  My husband had sneezed right after we'd left and couldn't get him to stop crying.\n\nHis happy place was bath time.  He loved water. It was amazing to see this tiny, beautiful, but very angry child be so calm while having his hair washed.\n\nAround this time, I was healed up enough to try babywearing.  My first c-section recovery was far harder than my second.  Nonetheless, I was prepared.  I had an ergo with an infant insert and a baby k'tan.  I tried the k'tan first.  He screamed so hard, I was certain I'd hurt him.  We spent a lot of money buying different carriers hoping we'd find one that wouldn't make him miserable.  I posted to babywearing groups.  Well-meaning parents told me to push through.  He'd get use to it.  I knew that had to be wrong.  No way were these parent's pushing through their kids crying with the intensity that he was. \n\nParenthood was not what I'd thought it would be.  I wanted to be an attachment parent.  I had a child who didn't want to be touched.  I didn't know how to soothe him.  And what happened to all those people saying he'd know my voice?  Why does he cry harder when I sing?  I was miserable.  He was miserable.  I'd often just lay in bed with him and sob into his beautiful hair while he wailed.  I knew something was wrong but couldn't figure out how to help this tiny human I'd carried, grown, and brought into this world. \n\nThere is a lot more that I could tell you here.  But I'll try and keep this relatively concise.  My oldest, my sweet beast, my glorious little animal is autistic.  He didn't want to be held because he doesn't like being touched or having his head tilted back.  He didn't like my singing because he has auditory processing differences that we haven't figured out.  He was miserable because, on top of being a baby, he was born into a world that wasn't very sensitive to all of the little things that make him unique. \n\nI said no screen time until 2.  I'm convinced he wouldn't be talking at all if we'd done that.  I thought we'd seriously limit screen time.  But he knows obscure animals, all his shapes, numbers, letters, and 10+ dinosaurs thanks to glorious screen time. \n\n**My point here isn't that your unhappy baby might be autistic.  My point is that gentle parenting/sensitive parenting/whatever isn't a set list of parenting behaviors.  Which I think we all know, in theory.  But we don't put that into practice, do we?  Sensitive parenting is listening to your child's cues.  Especially when they aren't the cues you might be expecting.**   \n\nI wish I'd listened when he told me he didn't want to be worn in a carrier.  I wish I'd accepted his decision instead of beating myself up and buying 6 different carriers in the span of 2 weeks.  He use to wear socks on his hands constantly.  He wanted them.  I felt odd about it.  But now he loves wearing gloves because it deadens the sensation of touching things.  I wish I hadn't stressed about his eating.  His diet is very restricted but he's getting enough calories and maintaining a healthy weight.\n\nAt least 90% of my stress as a parent comes from the cultural perspective that our kids are trying to manipulate us instead of treating their behavior as legitimate, equal to our own, and communicative.  Listen to your kids.  Give yourself some slack.  Don't try and fit your family into a neat little box.  It will be okay. ",

            "selftext": "Hi everyone. I wanted to post this because while I was in the thick of it I couldn't find any posts from people with similar experiences.\n\nI gained a lot of weight with my pregnancy, 60lbs. I was a healthy weight before and enjoyed an active lifestyle. After I gave birth I did not lose a single pound for 6 months despite calorie counting and forcing myself to go for runs (which was very painful, I had post partum joint pain for some reason).\n\nAnyways, I was struggling with confidence, and wondered if I should focus on accepting my new body as it was and go buy some new clothes that actually fit, or if I should keep trying.  A lot of my mom friends would say, \"oh the weight just melted off when I breastfed.\"  I did not see that at all, and that made me frustrated and sad. On top of that my milk supply was garbage, I'd get like 30ml per pump/nursing session, it did not feel like a fair deal. \n\nLong story short, I found that after I stopped nursing around 6 months post partum, the weight finally started coming off. I'm now close to a year out from birth and I'm back to my normal weight and my joint pain is gone.  I feel back to my usual self. \n\nI'm not saying my body is perfect, and there's definitely a need to accept your new body after birth. But if there's anyone out there feeling like weight loss is incredibly difficult, have hope that it's hormonal, and when you stop nursing it will get easier.  When/if I have another baby, I'm not going to bother trying to lose weight until I stop nursing.\n\nAnyways, I hope my experience can be useful for someone else. ",

            "selftext": "Before I get downvoted for not cutting these guys some slack, but I\u2019ve seen like the 100th about a father not stepping up to the plate. I saw another post the other day from a single mom saying these women should just be grateful that the father stuck around. Why is the standard so low? I\u2019m sorry that you are in your situation, but why would you tell women to just be happy with what they have when it clearly isn\u2019t good enough? \n\nWhy do these women need to adjust their expectations because \u201cmen don\u2019t like the baby stage\u201d? I don\u2019t like the baby stage either, but do I have the option of taking care of my kid? The reason that this continues is because some of you perpetuate this idea that the mother needs to be caretaker. I\u2019m not talking about what \u201cworks in your home\u201d. That\u2019s different and good for you that both of you are happy with the situation, but that is not the majority of what I see here. \n\nUsually the posts are like this one. The mother is resentful and exhausted, but has no choice except to live with the status quo because we don\u2019t demand that the father take on some responsibility of the child. Didn\u2019t the mother just spend 9 months carrying that exact child, likely getting no sleep because of the discomfort that comes with having an enormous belly? Isn\u2019t the least the father could do is take on one or two feedings a night and let his wife get some damn sleep? \n\nI realize there are some amazing dads out there either pulling their weight or being a SAHD. My husband is one of them and I hope he will teach our son these values. To all the moms out there struggling because your spouse won\u2019t pitch in, I\u2019m sorry. You deserve more. I hope you know that and won\u2019t be afraid to put your foot down and demand that your needs be taken care of. You need sleep, just like your spouse does. You need time to yourself, just like your spouse does. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you otherwise. \n\nThanks for letting me rant.",

I am so happy it is working out for you, and I will ALWAYS support you. This is for those mom's who shame other mom's for choosing formula. \n\nI get it. You are breastfeeding and you've been doing it for 2 years. That's SO AWESOME FOR YOU. \n\nI, on the other hand, gave it up at 5 weeks because my daughter was never satisfied due to latching issues (yes we visited many lactation consultants.) and laziness with eating (she's even lazy on the bottle and often comes unlatched but the bottle doesn't move out of her mouth). I chose to not pump because I wanted my freedom. I have PPD, and the though of still having to wake up so much at night made me want to rip my hair out. So I didn't. I gave it up because it ruined my marriage because of how awful my PPD was. It was MINE AND MY HUSBAND'S decision to switch to formula, and it made us so much better. My daughter is THRIVING. \n\nI already feel guilty about giving it up. You don't have to tell me all the benefits to breastfeeding. I already know that. DO NOT FUCKING TELL ME THAT FED ISNT BEST BECAUSE FORMULA CAN CAUSE CANCER (where the hell did you get that \"fact\" cause you sure can't tell me). Do not shame me because I chose something that was better for my family. You. Have. No. Say. \n\nSo kindly STFU if you are a \"breast is best\" mom. Sure breastfeeding has more benefits, we all know that. I do not care about it if it was harming my mental health. Formula is just as good, minus a few things. Formula was given to some of the most intelligent people. I was a formula baby. Guess what? I'm not an idiot. I'm not messed up in any way. So shut up with your preachy attitude. I'm done with you.

            "selftext": "Do something, ANYTHING, to include dads as part of your groups. I understand that moms want ladies-only time, which is totally fine, and you should have a space to do so. But this is 2018, there are now dads that are involved in their kids' lives as much as moms (shocking!). Even by calling the group \"Moms of (name of area)\" or \"Mommy and Me\" you are excluding the minority of stay-at-home dads, who are super isolated as it is, and have few options for social groups or activities involving their young children. Even if the idea of a gender-neutral group makes you nervous, why not at least ADMIT that you are excluding dads on the regular, and make an occasional event open to all genders. The dads' groups are few and far between, from what we've found.\n\nMy husband (his wedding ring on, mind you) was out today with our 8 month old son, and ran into a mom's group at the library. He didn't actively approach them, as usually this makes women uncomfortable (also annoying but ok), but one of the moms made a point to say hello to him and chat, which I REALLY appreciate. But all the other moms treated him like a pariah, acted super cold and didn't want to talk to him, and didn't even want to SAY that they were part of a mom's group, I guess for fear he would want to join in? My husband is the most friendly and respectful person, I'm just so infuriated he gets treated like this. Meanwhile I am in a male-dominated profession, and I am always treated as an equal at my workplace. So why can't he get the same treatment as a dad amongst moms? Can't we all admit that being alone with an infant all day can drive ANYONE crazy, and that dads can use some camaraderie with other parents, too, to survive the madness.",

            "selftext": "I have a feeling this is going to be a very unpopular post. I see so many conversations here about how working parents (usually dads) have it so much easier than SAHMs. Maybe they do, I don't know their specific situations. But I think what often gets lost in those conversations is working moms. For me and a lot of other working moms I know, work is not a break.\n\nIt is so frustrating to me to see posts about how work is easier than staying home, like all of us have cushy office jobs where we sit around drinking hot coffee, taking lunch breaks, hanging out with fun coworkers, and having peaceful bathroom breaks at our leisure. For some of us, none of those things are a reality. Some of us are on our feet nonstop, are so overbooked that we literally don't have time for a bathroom or lunch break, and have coworkers who are, well, not fun to say the least. \n\nAnd those comments ignore the challenges of work. Having to deal with difficult personalities (customers, coworkers, bosses). Having to deal with emergencies and crises where your mistakes can cause huge problems for other people, or cost you your job. Constantly being evaluated and called out publicly for your mistakes. Having to give presentations in front of big groups. Having to look and act professional even if you haven't slept for more than 30 minutes in a row. Having to leave your screaming baby behind you at daycare and pretending to smile and be okay until you get to your car and you cry too.\n\nMaybe none of these things are problems for anyone else. It seems to me like the dominant narrative in parenting communities is that being a SAHM is harder than being the working parent, and working parents go to work to get a break. I even see working parents join in on those conversations, and say they find work to be a break. So maybe there is just something wrong with me that I am struggling so hard. I guess I just ask to please be a little sensitive to the challenges of being the working parent and maybe try to avoid saying that one is easier or harder.",

            "selftext": "Exclusively pumping can either be really great or really awful. I had issues from the beginning with breast feeding and my LO didnt want to latch. I decided to exclusively pump. For me, it was soul sucking. I was obsessed about when I should pump, if my LO started to cry mid pump i would get mad at HIM instead of the situation. I was obsessive over how often i had to do it, if i missed a pump i got anxious that my supply would tank. I started to resent my son. Last night was my breaking point. My LO would not fall asleep after his 2 am feeding. I had gone 5 hours without pumping and I started to get pissed. I was so worried that I was going to fail him, I woke my husband up in panic and crying and said he wont go to sleep and I cant pump and my supply was going to tank.\n\n I spiraled, bad mouthed myself and said my LO would be better off without me since I struggle to provide for him. My husband, ever the level headed one, simply looked at me and said, \"then why dont you just stop pumping?\" And then it hit me. I have been so caught up with trying to force something that wasnt working out and haven't had the chance to bond with my LO. \n\nToday, we walked to target and bought formula. Today, I sat on the couch and fed my 3.5 week old boy 2.5 oz of formula and he fell asleep on me. He snuggled under my chin. And I wasnt worried about pumping because this is how I will provide for him. I was able to cuddle with my baby without worrying that he was going to wake up mid pump. I felt a world of worry lift off of me. \n\nTo all the mamas who exclusively pump, hats off to you. It takes so much to do it, and the anxiety it brings is so much. You are doing a great job. \n\nTo all the mamas who formula feed, you are providing for your baby. There should be no guilt. You are doing a great job. \n\nTo all the mamas who breastfeed, you are selfless and loving. You are doing a great job. ",

They make huge deals about feeding in public or around others, constantly talk about \u201cthe boob\u201d to everyone, not just in mommy communities. Honestly, just feed your kid and shut up about it. There wouldn\u2019t be a problem if you didn\u2019t act so entitled about something that\u2019s a very average thing. If people saw moms who formula feed talk like this they would laugh in their face. Feeing your kids shouldn\u2019t be such a pissing contest. ",

            "selftext": "So I just saved my child from suffocation, I'll open with that. Um, TW? \n\nThis is on a throw away because I'm embarrassed that it was even a thing.\n\nMy son has been... sensitive... to developmental leaps. He pretty much goes from an awesome sleeper to a horrible sleeper and back every few weeks or so. This most recent time, he had taken to throwing himself against the crib bars and getting caught. He was 5 months at this last sleep regression. My husband and I were constantly going in and untangling him and then resettling him. It had been about a week of this when my mom came to visit.\n\nSo, my mom is well intentioned, but all her information is old. She's not the grandma that has done research on new recommendations. She's the grandma that suggests rice cereal in a bottle (he's ebf) and stomach sleeping for a newborn (no). Anyways, she walks in and declares that we're going to target to get a bumper. She's amazed to find that they don't even sell padded bumpers alone (which is what she wanted) but was OK with a mesh bumper. I fought back, but I was exhausted. Hadn't slept that week, remember?\n\nAnyways, we go to target, [get this bumper](https://www.target.com/p/breathablebaby-174-solid-mesh-crib-liner/-/A-26403162?preselect=16313679#lnk=sametab), set it up and... that same day we realized there was an external stimuli that was causing all his super frustrating wake-ups. He only woke up once that night. Whatever, the bumper was on.\n\nSo it's been a month to 6 weeks, I can't remember at this point. The bumper has been on for a while. We're still in good sleep mode so it hasn't helped or hurt us. Until today, that is.\n\nMy kid woke up early from his nap for his third nap in a row and he's pissed. I check the monitor downstairs, he's rolling back and forth but fine (and pissed, like I said.) By the time I got to his room less than 10 seconds later, he had hooked his neck on the mesh bumped and was hanging from it. I picked him up, he was fine, I fed him, he's still fine.\n\nI can't stop thinking about what would have happened if I was asleep and not actively checking on him. I can't imagine me thinking, in my 4 am groggy haze, that he woke up but fell back to sleep, when in reality him falling back to sleep was his airway being cut off. I can't help but think if I had stopped off in the bathroom before getting him from his crib, he could have lost his oxygen supply for a period of time and been severely injured, as this happened between me checking the monitor and getting to his room. This could have been so much worse.\n\nI know there are dangers at every turn, and it's our job as parents to dodge these dangers, do our research, keep our kids safe. My \"whatever\" attitude over something I knew was unsafe and didn't want could have changed my life forever.\n\nSo, please, don't use bumpers. They aren't safe, ever. \n\ntl;dr 6 month old almost hanged himself on a \"safe\" mesh bumper.",

It\u2019s ok to say \u201cno\u201d!\n\nHelping isn\u2019t hogging the baby. Helping is cooking. Cleaning.

Giving you that comfy chair in from of the tv. \n\nSome relative shushing a fussing baby when their holding them. \u201cYou don\u2019t need mommy you have me!\u201d Isn\u2019t helping.\nFor a lot of babies that\u2019s the first time meeting aunt Karen. You wouldn\u2019t want to be hugged and kissed by strangers either Karen! \n\nInsisting on having washed hands/not smoking when visiting is perfectly ok, Momma.  It\u2019s your babies health. Your call! \n\nTo all moms to new babies. It\u2019s your baby and your call. If you or baby aren\u2019t comfortable with a situation, you can shut it down. \n\nWhy? Because you said so.

While I was pregnant she was making me feel like shit with her comments about \"don't put my grandbaby in USED clothes!!\" \"Don't buy nasty THRIFT STORE stuff\" hey Mom, I can't afford to put your grandbaby in brand new $18 Carter's that she's gonna spit up on, poop on, and outgrow in a month. \ud83e\udd37 I basically told her if you wanna buy it, GREAT. If I am dressing this baby, she's gonna be dressed within my means. \n\nFound a Once Upon A Child in my town, which is rather affluent, and you can find barely used Carter's sleep n plays for $2.50-$3.50/ea. Some of them aren't used at all and are new w tags!! \n\nMy mom ended up flying in and I took her to OUAC and she was like \"oh, this is actually pretty nice\" and dropped like $50 on baby clothes when we got AT LEAST twice as much stuff as we would have gotten at the Carter's store. She retracted her comments about it being \"nasty\" and unsuitable for her grandbaby. This week they have all their Christmas goodies out and I found Christmas outfits for $2!! Gonna have the kid decked out in reindeer. \n\nNever full price. \u2764\ufe0f",

With her, the experience was exactly what i wanted-epidural worked well, pushed less than an hour and it was very peaceful. I felt powerful. This time, i did not feel powerful at all. \n\nWith my son, he was born 2 weeks early and it started as an induction. I wound up not having time for pain meds and i still feel deeply embarrassed about the way i screamed and cursed during the last 10-15 minutes. Delivering without meds was one of my biggest fears and while i did it, i always thought i was more tough than that. I've been hurt many times and usually didn't make much of a sound but for some reason i couldn't help but scream during the 2 minutes i pushed. I'm not sure why but i just can't get the crippling sense of embarrassment i feel to go away. \n\nHas anyone here ever felt the same way? If so, how did you move past it? ",

            "selftext": "I just had my third baby 4 weeks ago. We also have a 2 and 4 yo. They are in daycare full-time. I have eight more weeks of leave left.\n\nWhile husband was on paternity leave the first four weeks, we came up with this list of things to do that we'd been putting off. On my list was stuff like \"put away clothes that are too small for kids\" \"put away maternity clothes\" \"figure out life insurance.\" I kept my list shortish, because I also just pooped out a fucking baby, am breast feeding. I've done both twice before, but there is still seem healing/re-learning to do.\n\nHusband's list was way longer, and was fix it stuff. Fine, he's not working, I can do more baby stuff.\n\nNow he's giving me tasks to do while I'm on leave and he's back at work. Not hard stuff necessarily, like wipe down the cabinets, touch up paint on cabinets, wash dirt off walls, \"30 min of cleaning per day\" whatever that means. I already do that?\n\nI'll do this shit IF I have time. I told him these were my priorities: my mental health, the baby (including some snuggle time - it's good for the baby and it's my last baby every JFC!), dishes and laundry. Everyday. THATS IT. He says \"that doesn't constitute a whole day\" \"it's just one baby we're not in survival mode\" \"you hold the baby too long\" \"other stay at home moms do it, why can't you\"  \"I get these things done, so I know it's possible.\" \n\nFuck him. Last night I bet I got 2-4 hours of sleep. The second the baby fell asleep int the morning, the other two woke up. The oldest is having behavior problems, last night she spit in my face. The middle can't do lots of thing still, and needs help a lot.\n\nFuck him. I'm so angry. Makes me feel lazy, and like a child. I vacillate between thinking \"he's just sort of an asshole\" to \"maybe I really am lazy.\" Plus I have other shit I wanted to do if I had time like finish middle kids baby book and start this one's baby book. But I realize these things aren't quite as impactful on our daily life.\n\nI dunno. I'm tired.",

We've just had horrible latching issues despite trying everything. \n\nToday is the day that I start to look up and really care for my baby. I want her to look at me and feel comfort, not stress like she has. I want to feel true love, not anxiety and anger because she won't eat properly. \n\nToday is the day I begin to pump only for a mi its or two to relieve engorgement and safely dry up my supply. It's the hardest part because I see how much I've been making for her and it's going to waste because I don't want to pump. \n\nToday is the day I begin battling with the guilt of giving up on breastfeeding. I feel like I've failed because I can't get her to effectively feed. Despite all our best efforts it's just not for me this time. I gave it 5 weeks. I gave my all. I gave up myself. I did everything and yet j still feel like I'm failing her. \n\nToday is the day I take a big leap forward in becoming a better person for my daughter, for my husband, for my family, but most importantly for me. \n\nSo goodbye breastfeeding. It's been rough, and I'm so sad to fully give it up despite all the turmoil I've gone through. This is what's necessary for me and my family though. Maybe next time. ",

And you know what? I've mostly adapted but as we come up to one year I'm just having a really hard time coping with the fact that he still wakes at least three times a night. Like he SHOULD be sleeping better by now right? Well I think I'm starting to realise that I just need to accept that he will sort himself out when he's ready. And if I stop worrying about what he should be doing I can just enjoy all the amazing things that he's doing and learning right now. ",

Well last night I woke up in the middle of the night and thought it was weird he wasn't awake yet or making any noise (he still wakes up a few times each night, every 2-3 hours or so) I go over to his crib to find him face down. In his swaddle. Freaking out I quickly flip him back over and he gasped. I'm still so shaken up all I want to do is cry. I always put him on his back. He hadn't rolled over up until that point so I didn't expect it. I've been trying to transition him to sleep without a swaddle but since hes having a hard time adjusting and I was already so tired I gave in and swaddled him last night. I feel so guilty. I don't know what I would have done had I gotten a different result after flipping him over. I'm sorry. I just need to let this out before it eats me alive all day ",

            "selftext": "Before I had my son (he's 16 days old) I thought I would love having visitors. I was excited about our families' plans to visit and figured I'd like showing my baby off to the few friends I actually hang out with. \n\nSince he was born, though, I've just wanted everyone (with the exception of my mom) to go away and leave us alone. I had a c-section with complications, lost a lot of blood, and the first ten days after were really rough. \n \nMy husband's parents were here for five days after my son was born and they want to come back in a week when my sister-in-law visits. Last time they watched TV at top volume the entire time and kept leaving the front door open while the A.C. was running. Every time my MIL held my baby he ended up reeking of her perfume, and my FIL kept telling me not to wake up my husband (even when I'd let him sleep 9 hours straight and I was so tired I was falling asleep breastfeeding). \n\nThen one of my friends is being super annoying. She has texted me every day since the baby came, asking to come over and giving unsolicited (and completely UNhelpful) advice. She's always been kind of self-centered and high maintenance, but I had more patience for it before. It's weird to me in the first place that she asks to come over (to me it's good manners to wait for an invitation to someone else's house) especially since she knows I'm a new mom and I'm barely sleeping. And it's not like she's asking if she can bring me food or come over to help me out in any way; she just wants to come over and talk about herself while she holds my baby. \n\nAlso it seems like everyone who has/wants to visit can't be bothered to nail down a specific time or day for a visit (with the exception of my mom who has been extremely helpful and considerate). They want to just show up or send a text when they are on their way. That's not really convenient considering how many appointments we've had (baby's check ups, my check ups, getting staples removed, seeing lactation consultant, etc) and it's hard for me to plan a nap for myself when I don't know if/when guests are going to show up. \n\nAnyway, I probably sound like a big jerk, but I mostly don't care. I just want to be with my husband and baby. Thanks for letting me vent. ",

Despite my baby gaining rapidly while EBF and *nearly* around the clock, our routine was deemed not to be \u2018optimal\u2019 because my husband gives her expressed breastmilk from 8-11PM while I catch and few uninterrupted hours of sleep. Apparently I\u2019ll give her nipple confusion and \u2018insecure attachment\u2019, and myself mastitis, by taking these 3 hours to myself. \n\nFrom one extreme to the other, my mother-in-law shared the story of my husband\u2019s newborn experience in her care. Under the guidance of her own mother, my mother in law would only feed him and his siblings \u2018slightly sweetened water\u2019 from 8PM to 6AM starting from their very first night outside the womb!! The idea, she told me, was to teach them that it\u2019s \u2018not worth their time\u201d to bother waking in the night for a feed. None of them, she told me proudly, bothered to wake from night 3 onwards. And after telling me this astonishing tale, she capped it off by informing me that I\u2019d already been holding my baby for 20 minutes straight, and I\u2019d better put her down if I didn\u2019t want to spoil her!!\n\nMy midwife would call DOCS (Australian CPS) on me in a heartbeat for that treatment, but I\u2019ve been recommended it by several older women in my life!! I have a dread fascination with the child rearing methods of the 80s and before. It seems like every generation did it totally different, yet their kids all turned out mostly ok. Who else has been told such wildly different pieces of \u2018advice\u2019?",

Going on a date night is great. You are not less of a parent for spending time away from your child regardless of their age.\n\nOn the flip side, there is nothing wrong with wanting to spent all your time with your child. Don't want to get a sitter? Great, you know what makes you happy as a parent. Someone not wanting to leave their kid does not automatically mean they don't support you leaving yours. They just have different individual wants.\n\nIt's not cool to judge people just because they do things differently. Looking down on other moms with loved and cared for children because you would do it differently is ridiculous.",

            "selftext": "Blergh. I had the most upsetting interaction with someone today. She was asking me about my son\u2019s birth and if I had a natural birth or a c-section. I told her that I had a c-section and she turns to me and says \u201coh, so you\u2019re not a real real mom.\u201d I tell her \u201cwell, i have a real baby at home and those pains were pretty real, and the pain was pretty real, so you could say i\u2019m a very real real mom.\u201d This small exchange has consumed me for the rest or the night. How people can think that just because it wasn\u2019t a natural birth that i\u2019m some sort of \u201cfake mom\u201d or that it\u2019s some easy way out. \n\nMy whole pregnancy was high risk due to severe preeclampsia in my first pregnancy. So then according to that logic my first baby, who passed away at 27 weeks also doesn\u2019t make me a mom. I did\u2019t see him, didn\u2019t get to hold him, didn\u2019t get anything but his little hands on a piece of paper in a box. I carried him inside of me and that, to me, is enough to make me a mom. I carried my second pregnancy and was in labor for 30 hours before i stopped dilating and my baby was under stress with the induction. Not that I have to justify my c-section, but what the hell, man? My recovery was brutal because THEY CUT ME OPEN. \n\nSorry, i\u2019m just feeling hurt &amp; irritated. You are a mom no matter how you have that child and no one can tell you different.\n\n",

Trust me, I have every sippy cup, toddler cup, thermos, reusable straws/lids you can think of and the damn Malibu Rum is what works.

            "selftext": "Hi all. Second time posting within 24 hours actually. I am a new mom to a colicky baby, and at 23, a new \"adult\" in general. It hasn't been easy for me and I had an experience I wanted to write about. Feel free to tell me if I am being too harsh or just plain wrong. I am really kind of hurt about it and needed to vent...\n\nI have been struggling with my identity as a stay at home mom. I have a degree in English literature and was working on my certificate as an English teacher when I got pregnant. Totally fine. I am happy and have always dreamed of being a mom . But I went from one kind of stimulation to a completely different kind. My real dream, along with being a mom, has always been to be an author. I have been working on my book during nap times, which have been few and far between lately. \n\nAnyway, my cousin connected me with a \"mom friend.\" Maybe this sounds harsh, but she wants children and kind of groups all of her \"mom friends\" together. This alone can be kind of hurtful, but I take it as how she imagines doing things when she becomes a mom. She kept trying to connect me with this one particular girl. Let's call her Jordan...because that's her name. My cousin told me that Jordan and I would connect, because she has a colicky baby too. \n\nWell I finally say okay because I was desperate one day. We begin talking, and connect on baby things. However, it probably should come to no surprise that outside of this subject, we had very little in common. I was bummed but should have followed my instinct that I shouldn't make friends with anyone just on the basis of motherhood. I guess I was just hoping something good would come out of trying. So I stop messaging her and let it sort of fizzle out.\n\nFast forward to yesterday evening, when I had had a difficult day. I got a message from her. It basically read:\n\n**Hey there! I am sure you have heard of (insert company name I have never heard of here). Well, I am hosting a party Saturday to enjoy their books with the kiddos! Sort of a Mommy's Night In! Bring your PJs, and have a nice cup of hot tea...or an extra large glass of red wine. ;) \nHope to see you there!**\n\nAnyway, I am reciting this from memory because I deleted the message...but it seemed like it was copy and pasted and reeked of an MLM scam. And I get that people need to make money but so does everyone. Perhaps this is where I went wrong, but I messaged my cousin about it. I would have usually let it slide...but I really really could have used a message from an an actual friend last night. \n\nI said, \"So, your friend tried to sell me something last night.\" \nTo which she replied, \"It is so her kid can get free books. I am helping her.\" \n\nAt this point I want to scream \"fuck you.\" I don't...but fuck you. Fuck you for selling out your friends, fuck you for buying into this, fuck you for approaching motherhood in such a wrong way. Fuck you for grouping us together because we are all moms. Fuck you for \"okay-ing\" Jordan on messaging this to me, and fuck you for thinking I would appreciate it. Fuck you for not telling her that I have experience with teaching and literature, and could actually help you with getting free books if that's what this was truly about. \n\nPerhaps what hurts the most in all of this may come across as odd to you. It was one of the last lines in the chain letter: **or an extra large glass of red wine ;) **\n\nMy husband lets me indulge myself on weekends and he says this same exact thing. He starts a bubble bath for me, heats up formula, and says, \"Have an extra large glass of red wine\" with a wink. Exactly like that. I feel so stupid...because it is exactly what I need. I drink red wine, I have cheese and bread with olive oil. I watch old Westerns and read books. I am embarassed that this scam and this \"mom friend\" were exactly right about me. An extra large glass of red wine is exactly how to draw me in. I have been struggling and this company knows it. I am just so...hurt. I never want to talk to this woman again and I am certainly mad at my cousin.\n\nSo...that's me. Tell me if I am too harsh. Tell me if I am wrong about this being a potential MLM scam and if I overreacted. Tell me if I need empathy. The thing is...I get this woman is struggling and thus selling to me. It's just...I am struggling too, and couldn't there be a better way to handle it as women?\n\nAnyway...it is Wednesday and I am just two days away from my extra large glass of red wine.\n\nWinky face.

So I did what any well-functioning adult would do: I picked him up and ran to the bathroom, where I had horrible diarrhea while nursing my baby and feeling pretty friggin sorry for myself.

            "selftext": "What do new mothers do all day?  \n  \nA new mother looked at me recently during a conversation we were having about sleep deprivation during the beginning of baby's life.  \n  \nAs a postpartum advisor and doula, I talk to a lot of new mamas.  \n  \nBut I hear all the time from women in the midst of transition to motherhood who are struggling to get their little ones to sleep and to respond to the demands of infant life.  \n  \nThis mama looked at me in desperation and asked, \u201cSo do you just not get anything done then??\"  \n  \nMamas, I want to tell you the truth. Here it is:\nYou will not get anything done when you are home with a baby.  \n  \nAnd anyone who told you otherwise is not being very forthcoming (or perhaps they just have a lousy memory).  \n  \nYou might get yourself fed.  \nYou might get yourself dressed (then again, you might not).  \nYou might take a walk (it makes baby happy).  \nYou might have a short phone conversation or start a load of laundry, neither of which you will finish.  \nThis is your new-mom normal.  \n  \nSo what are you doing all day?  \n  \nNot much that can be measured, really.  \nYou're simply responding appropriately and with patience (through fatigue) to smiles, to tears, to hunger cues and to drowsiness, teaching your baby how to navigate this complex and (to a baby) highly emotional and raw world.  \n  \nYou are keeping your baby clean, which on some days involves more costume changes (for both of you) than any non-mother can begin to fathom.  \n  \nYou are teaching a tiny, helpless person all about the world\u2014at least the important parts, like how we treat each other and what it means to be connected to a family.  \n  \nYou are creating a foundation of love and trust between you and your baby, one that will help you set your parenting compass, inform your future interactions, and provide a basis for the way your child relates to the larger world.  \n  \nYou may be breastfeeding your baby\u2014another time-consuming task (though once established, it takes less time than bottle feeding) that reaches forward through time to heal and protect your child, and simultaneously reduces your risk of disease.  \n  \nOh, and you're becoming a mother.  \nIt started the day your baby was conceived, and it continues beyond birth.  \nYour baby is stretching and growing into this new body, and you are too.  \n  \nBut that's about it, really. That's your day.  \nOur culture doesn't have a good way to measure what you are accomplishing.  \nYour baby will grow and meet milestones: check.     \n  \nTo the untrained eye, most of this work, at the end of the day, will look like nothing.  \n  \nBut we know better.  \n  \nThere is no greater task than the \u201cnothing\" you did yesterday, the \u201cnothing\" you are doing today and the \u201cnothing\" you will do tomorrow.  \n  \nCaring for a baby is all about the immediate experience, yet the first two years are all about investment.  \nIt's give, give, give and give some more.  \n  \nThese are hard-fought, rough-and-tumble years that can cut us down to our core and take us soaring high above the clouds, all in the space of five minutes.  \nAnd yes, as you do the hardest work of your life, it will seem like you're not getting anything done at all. Crazy, huh?  \n  \nBut here's where it gets interesting...  \nAs much as you need and want a break now (and you should take one whenever you can), no mother has ever looked back on this time and thought, I wish I had held my baby less.  \n  \nYou will not remember the dishes that didn't get done, the vacuuming that you just couldn't make happen or the dirty clothes you wore more often than you'd like to admit.  \n  \nYou will remember the first smile, the first belly laugh, the first words, the first steps.  \nYou will remember the way you looked at your baby and the way your baby looked at you.  \n  \nSo the next time you find yourself wondering how another day is gone and nothing is done, stop.  \n  \nHold your baby\u2014feel the way that tiny body strains to contain this giant soul\u2014complete and full of potential all at the same time.  \n  \nTake a deep, slow breath.  \n  \nClose your eyes and measure your day not as tasks, but as feelings, as sounds, as colors.  \n  \nExhaustion is part of it.  \n  \nAnd it's true, you will get \u201cnothing\" done.  \nBut the hard parts will fade.  \n  \nThe intense, burning love is what remains, and it is yours to keep forever.  \n  \n-Anne Rust",

I\u2019m seriously exhausted. I had a breakdown last week and sobbed while rocking her at 7 am as he was getting up for work, watching me cry. I sent him a long text later that day saying I can\u2019t do it anymore, I need sleep, and asked him to get up with the baby on weekend mornings so I can get a couple of hours so I don\u2019t go insane. He has never gotten up with her at night, not even once, even though she\u2019s formula fed. He did it yesterday (has Sunday Monday off) no problem. I asked him last night if he would do it again the next morning, and he said \u201cwhen do I get to sleep in?\u201d\n\nFull stop. \n\nAnswer: you don\u2019t. Does he think I\u2019m sleeping those couple of hours because I\u2019m lazy and want to just \u201csleep in\u201d? Because news flash, I\u2019m not. I haven\u2019t slept a full night since she was born, meanwhile he\u2019s never not slept a full night. I\u2019m exhausted to the point of literally SOBBING and he\u2019s worried about sleeping in on weekends??? Are you kidding me??? It\u2019s almost 6:30 AM, she\u2019s been awake since 4, despite going to sleep at 9, and he just keeps looking over the blankets to see what\u2019s going on, no offer to help. Just watching. \n\nShe\u2019s not only my kid, WE made her. I\u2019m so annoyed with him for even asking that question. ",

I only found out bc someone posted it to the local mom group. \n\nI wish I didn't feel so strongly, but I genuinely hate antivax parents. \n\nLike Amy how the fuck does your degree in interior design make you any authority on medicine. Moms in the comments talking about how a vaccinated kid must've shed it, and how catching measles won't be that bad if you have enough vitamin A \ud83d\ude21 \nLike getting autism (not true) is worse than watching your kid die horribly from some disease /s\n\nAnd I've seen the antivax website!! How do you live long enough to have children and not realize that any \"secret information\" behind a paywall is probably bullshit! The doctors responsible for it deserve to have their heads kicked in. How dare you take advantage of people who are trying to do the right thing for their kids and leading them so far astray FOR PROFIT.\n\nSeriously people putting themselves and everyone else at risk. It doesn't help that my state has the most vaccine waivers.\n\nI have pregnant friends, friends having newborn babies in nearby hospitals right now, and my baby is still only 3 months old. This stuff terrifies me and it pisses me off because this kind of crisis is entirely preventable. Now I have to worry about all the babies and all the kiddos who can't get immunized for medical reasons.\n\nI needed to put this out there somewhere, I'm angry because I'm scared about the people I love getting hurt.",

            "selftext": "Before we became parents, I imagined that while my husband would be working, I\u2019d do the bulk of the child care and he would help when he was home.  He used to travel three nights a week for work, plus he has a weekly boys night.\n\nOnce LO arrived, he now travels ~ once a week and he still gets boys night every week.  \n\nI however have not had more than four hours away from my rather high maintenance baby in the 11.5 months she\u2019s been alive.   I\u2019ve given up my volunteer work, my part time job, 95% of my time with friends.  \n\nAnd now that we have a kid, I am suddenly expected to do more around the house.  And I honestly agree that as the SAHM, I should be doing more housework, but this kid takes everything I have and I just can\u2019t find the time or energy for dusting or cleaning toilets.  \n\nHusband works 8-4, and obviously can\u2019t look after Kiddo during that time.  This pays our bills and mortgage.  \n\nOnce he gets home, he wants to relax from his work day.  He doesn\u2019t want to do housework or cook and he definitely doesn\u2019t want to deal with an unhappy baby (extra pressure on me to have her in a good mood by the time he gets home).\n\nOvernight, he needs to sleep so that he can work the next day.  His coworkers actually teased him for looking like hell after Kiddo was born and he resolved that overnights were now my domain (not a discussion, this was simply his decision).\n\nSometimes Kiddo sleeps through the night, sometimes she\u2019s up from midnight to five or later (6:45am and she\u2019s currently playing in her room while I watch from the rocker).\n\nI also need braces (for health as well as aesthetic reasons) and want to take two years to do that.   It\u2019s something I\u2019ve always wanted for myself but only recently could I afford it.  \n\nSo I\u2019m coping but not thriving or enjoying being a parent to our almost one year old.  Selfishly, I almost regret having a baby.  \n\nAnd now Husband is talking about me having the next kid.  He\u2019s worried about waiting too long (we\u2019re mid-thirties) and neither of us wants to still be having kids at 40+.  \n\nHow do I tell him that while I love our daughter, I physically cannot manage another baby right now?  I\u2019m certain it would ruin our marriage and we\u2019d end up divorced.   I feel like a single parent and have warned him that we don\u2019t need to cohabitate in order for us to raise Kiddo the way he wants.  He could just send us a check and maybe take her out for play dates.  \n\n\n(Sorry if this is a jumble.  I\u2019m sleep-deprived and pissed off).",

We stopped by a sandwich place to get lunch, and (since mom doesn\u2019t get ANYTHING to herself anymore) I shared my light, peach flavored lemonade with my toddler. It wasn\u2019t super busy, but enough that an older couple was at a table near ours and as I offer my straw to kiddo, I catch the woman\u2019s face out of the corner of my eye. She looks HORRIFIED, probably thinking I\u2019m giving my toddler soda. Yeah, lemonade isn\u2019t much better, buthe had a bottle of water which he was drinking out of and only took two sips total. She watched him take both, and then ducked over the table to whisper to her husband. I actually got a kick out of that, and couldn\u2019t wait to share with my SO. \n\nWe went to the grocery store next and as we\u2019re wrapping up, I let my toddler out of the cart and strap him into his harness. Yep; I **leashed** my kid - the horror!! He doesn\u2019t mind and it better enables me to stop his suicidal tendencies. Most people thought it was adorable, because his harness has a bright green dinosaur as the \u201cbackpack\u201d but an older lady (why is it always older ladies?) initially smiled at my son and then caught sight of the leash, followed it with her eyes to my hand and then gave me the most disapproving glare I\u2019ve had directed at me since I told my mom I was moving three states away at 18. This lady spat FIRE with her beady eyes.\n\nSo, twice in one day I\u2019ve felt the warm fuzzy disapproval for my parenting skills!",

            "selftext": "When my daughter was about 8 months we were shopping together at target. It was winter and she was wearing a blue fleece suit to stay warm. She, like many babies, had very little hair. I also wasn\u2019t too hung up on bows or other gender indicators because I don\u2019t care if you can\u2019t tell what genitals my baby has. Babies are babies. If others guess the gender wrong, I don\u2019t get hung up on it. \n\nSo while shopping at Target, an older woman saw my daughter and commented, \u201cwhat a cute little boy!\u201d \n\nMe: \u201cthanks!\u201d\n\nHer:  \u201chow old is he?\u201d \n\nMe: \u201c8 months\u201d\n\nHer: \u201cawww what\u2019s his name?\u201d\n\nMe: gives obviously female name. \n\nHer: \u201coh it\u2019s a girl? I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cit\u2019s ok. How would you know?\u201d\n\nHer: \u201cbut she\u2019s wearing blue.\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyeah, I liked the blue suit more than the other color options\u201d\n\nHer: \u201cyou need to put a bow in her hair so we can tell what she is.\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cit doesn\u2019t bother me if you call her a boy. She\u2019s a baby. It\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d\n\nHer: \u201cwell it would make it a lot easier to tell what she is\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyeah it\u2019s not a big deal\u201d\n\nHer: getting more frustrated with my relaxed tone \u201cwell it\u2019s too hard to tell she\u2019s a girl. She needs a bow or some pink.\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cit really doesn\u2019t bother me.\u201d Finds an excuse to move along. \n\nI have heard of parents getting offended when others have messed up their baby\u2019s gender (which, really, just relax!) but I\u2019ve never heard of a stranger getting upset when they couldn\u2019t tell, even though the parent was fine with the mix up.

Yes, after a day at work it can be tiring, but us moms are still at it. Work moms and SAH moms. We don't get that break. We're not expected to take breaks. I know it's \"normal\" for dads to be less involved and hands-off and we do everything **but it shouldn't be!** My husband is constantly cuddling and playing with our daughter. If I'm holding her he asks \"do you need a break? You sure?\" because he want to hold her. I had to shoo him off to his first day back at work because he kept asking if I needed anything. He came home on his lunch break to make sure I was ok. I've heard people say they wish their husband helped like that. **They should!** We shouldn't normalize distant husbands, or unhelpful husbands, or emotionally *abusive* husband's who guilt trip you when Baby is crying but they won't lift a finger. It hurts my heart to see moms wonder if they are overreacting when they have to beg their husbands to help. Marriage is a partnership, don't treat parenting any differently.",

It was out at a little family friendly brewery down the street from me. I like this place, all the food is made in house.\n\nWell this person commented \"Do you ever cook meals at home? lol\" First off, shut the fuck up. Secondly, rarely. I'm sorry that I'm not sorry. Having a 12 month old and cooking dinner before my husband gets home is fucking hard. I try my best. When she goes to sleep I prepare her HOME. MADE. LUNCHES. and breakfast for the morning. So god damn sorry that sometimes it's just easier to take the kid out when my husband gets home. I certainly hope that when she is older, cooking will be a little easier. She goes to bed at 7, and if I want to cook..I gotta wait for her to go bed. Yes Karen, I know crockpots are easy. Go shove one up your ass.\n\nThis woman has a 17 year old daughter so either she forgot what's like or she is one of those people who were lucky and their kid was happy just sitting there while mom cooked. :(\n\n\n..Now I am feeling super self conscious. She's only 19 pounds, it's not like she's an obese child that I am shoveling food into..",

            "selftext": "Sorry for the strong language but I am sick of the competitive mommy games about how or what you feed your kid. Guess what? It's all HARD. Breastfeeding, pumping, formula--they all have their own battles. In two months, I've already been slammed for every decision about feeding my daughter. And it's all a load of crap. \n\nNursing: your nipples are so sore, just give it up; you need to give a bottle so daddy can help you and bond with baby; your boobs are going to be so weird- don't you want your body back? \n\nExclusively pumping: you're so tied to that pump, you won't bond with baby; it's not the same as getting it from the source so just do formula; you must not have tried hard enough to breastfeed. \n\nFormula: oh you've just given up; don't you miss that bond; is baby getting enough nutrients; breast is best. \n\nDon't ask me if baby is breast or bottle. I won't ask you how many servings of vegetables your kid has had today, Barbra. Your kid is literally eating grass as you're judging my daughter as she drinks her bottle so let's just get down from that high horse right now, Karen. And Facebook mom groups can just collectively F off. \n\nHere's the deal- We did everything perfect and my daughter just ended up being a poopy eater. She was capable of nursing but didn't want to so we have to measure her intake. She was still a bit small so we added formula to the mix. I've fought sore, cracked and inverted nipples. I have D-MER and fight through that for most of my let downs. I searched for the best formula and bottles around. NONE of it is easy, NONE of it was decided lightly. \n\nAll moms know how much we just want to do what's best for our babies. So why do moms beat each other up??? \n\n\n",

Thought r/breastfeeding was it until I saw the post complaining about the world being \"antibreastfeeding\" today with the majority of the comments saying disgusting things about formula feeders. Where can I talk about feeding my baby that isn't surrounded by assholes?",

I've read two posts today on another site (facebook) that makes me wonder. \n\n\nOne was a mother whose car door hit another persons car while she was struggling to get her kid+stuff into the car. Her comment once the driver of the other car made a single annoyed comment about being careful, was that said driver should have offered to help her get her things into the car rather than be annoyed about the possible damage to his own vehicle.\n\n\nThe second was a mother who had taken the kid to the doctor, and by her own admission the kid was \"happy running around and a bit noisy\" when someone told her kid off. Am I the only one who realises that people with headaches and migranes go to the doctor? Maybe having a kid being \"a bit noisy\" was a bit more noise than the person could stand? The comment section is saying that said guy should \"go away if he doesn't like it\". Or maybe. . . just maybe. . . he shouldn't have to? don't get me wrong, kids are kids, but maybe not letting your child run around in a place where sick people are is more common sense than some people have. \n\n/rant over. \n\nYes, I am being unfair. I was not there in either situation. I honestly think I am going to unsub from this facebook group because the amount of \"I have an oil for that\" and \"everyone should bow down before mothers because WE GIVE LIFE\" is kinda getting to me.

There was a couple of bags of chips left over, and our boss usually offers for someone to take them home. One lady took one bag and mentioned that I should take the other for my toddler. I thought she was kidding, so I laughed and said, \"Oh, year right. She doesn't eat chips.\" She was genuinely shocked, but I had to walk away for a second to put something in my office. When I got back, a couple of my other co-workers were there, and she was lamenting my child saying \"That poor baby, oh that poor kid. She doesn't give her chips. Oh, that poor child.\" So when I came back, I kindly told her that they are too hard and too salty. She has eaten tortilla chips, but she gags and scratches her gums on them, so I stopped giving them to her. She replies \"I bet you don't give her soda pop either!\" Um, no, I do not. Of course she walks away talking with herself about how my poor toddler has such a sad life. \n\nIm not trying to be pretentious here, but soda and salty chips for a 1 year old??? Am I really being crazy? Our pediatrician said to not even give her juice as it has so many sugars and rather feed her fresh fruit instead. ",

            "selftext": "I'm an American who has lived in Germany for almost 6 years, and have au paired, worked at an elementary school and preschool here and am raising my toddler here so I've had a lot of time and exposure to reflect a bit on the differences in parenting I've observed between the US and Germany (I will note that I'm in an urban area) as it's fascinated me, I'm hoping to write a more comprehensive article on the topic-\n\nTERMINOLOGY\n\nI've found that a lot of parents here tend not to get too focused, stuck, or for that matter, have even heard of a lot of parenting \"terms\" many American parents use utilize...\"baby led weaning, co-sleeping, exclusively breastfed, attachment parenting, sleep training, RIE\"...some of these terms have been translated into German \"Breifrei\"=BLW for instance but there hardly seems to be the level of concern, debate or usage of terms related to styles, dogma, techniques etc. that appears to be more prevalent in the US.  \n\nPARENTAL LEAVE\n\nParental leave in Germany is paid, and it's generous and lengthy, particularly compared to the US. So for instance, less women here pump  on a regular basis if they are breastfeeding, simply because they don't have to. Some women still do pump, of course, so that other people can watch the baby, or if they have BFing issues, etc.\n\nA very exclusive-to-Germany baby class quite popular here while on parental leave is called PEKIP. Your baby gets to be completely naked in a small group of other babies of the same age (within three months) and a group leader provides some structured activities, answers developmental questions, etc. I did this with my son when he was 9 months old and he loved it. Which brings me to my next topic-\n\nPUBLIC NUDITY/PEEING (KIDS)\n\nCulturally, Germany is way more lax about nudity compared to the US. People will sometimes bathe in rivers or lakes naked, many public pools have nude areas, some large urban parks even have some naked sunbathing areas as well. It's just not that big of a deal. As a result, many small kids are permitted to run around on a warm day at a playground or in their garden or whatever naked, or just a diaper, and no one is bothered. Small kids will often pee in public parks/playgrounds in the bushes as well, as it's often the case that there are not toilets there, this is also seen as fine. Most German parents I have met use anatomically correct terminology with their kids instead of stuff like \"weenie\" \"your pee-pee\" etc.\n\nINDEPENDENCE\n\nGerman kids appear to be given much more independence at a young age here and have higher expectations of being independent than what I've observed in the US. At daycare, they are expected to clean up their toys, set the table, clean up dishes, brush their teeth even before they are 2 years old.  As school children, most kids walk, bike, or take public transit to school independently, many kids as early as 7 or 8 years old. They often go in small groups together and many kids are able to stay home alone at a far younger age than many American kids.\n\nI think there are a number of reasons for this. Most of Germany is very safe, there is very little gun violence, so parents are usually not as concerned about safety. It's a smaller country with good public transit and bike lanes in many areas, so it also makes it easier for kids to get around on their own, you don't necessarily need a car in certain places. Also from a cultural standpoint, there is a high emphasis and value on being communal and looking out for each other, so sometimes a parent will say to another parent on the playground, \"hey, can you watch my kid for 5 minutes while I go do xyz,\" etc.\n\nRULE FOLLOWING\n\nIt's kind of a cultural stereotype, but I have sort of found it to be true- it's a country that loves rules and regulations. Mostly it works, but there are times when it can be a little \"much.\" People might yell at you for jaywalking, because you are therefore setting a bad example for kids. Many daycares, kindergartens, schools etc have a lot of routines and set rules for the kids to follow. One thing many German parents seem to get particularly obsessive about is making sure their kids are properly dressed for various occasions :) rain pants for the rain, bathing shoes for walking on the beach, etc...\n\nTECHNOLOGY\n\nThis may be a biased view from my standpoint in an urban area but it seems like parents' allowing their kids to access technology at a young age here is often class-based. Well-eduated, well-off parents don't seem to give their young kids much technology exposure as I have observed many American parents do (TV on all day, kid is allowed to play with smartphone or IPad, etc), I have met numerous parents who fall into the upper-middle class category who really don't give their young kids much screen time. With older kids, though, it seems comparable to the US, I see practically every young teen and adolescent with a smart phone here. \n\nMany German parents also are very concerned with Internet privacy for their children. A school here would probably never make a Facebook page and post shots of the kids that show their faces or use their real names, etc. A large chunk of parents here feel that it is problematic to put their kids on social media in any way, some can honestly get a bit self-righteous about it, but as a society Internet privacy is generally a big topic\n\nALTERNATIVE MEDICINE\nA lot of what is viewed as alternative medicine for kids in the US is super common in Germany, especially homeopathy, as many doctors here even utilize it in their practice and every pharmacy offers homeopathic remedies and pharmacists trained in homeopathy. Home remedies are pretty widely used too, especially ones not as known in the US, like wrapping your kid in beeswax and wool for a chest cold, etc. \n\n\n\n",

            "selftext": "My 15 month old sleeps like a champ (knock on wood). We have other stuff going on - she hates the car seat, she has intense stranger danger, she is extremely energetic and hates to do calm activities like storytime or time in the stroller, she recently learned to scream \"no!\" at everything and kicks me furiously when I change her diaper - but by the grace of God she's a good sleeper. We have always been militant about a schedule because I personally feel that everyone operates better with a predictable routine. (Blame it on fostering rescue dogs for so long before diving into motherhood - dogs crave routines and I feel like some babies maybe do too.) \n\nAnyway, I'm not sure if she's such a good sleeper because of the strict routine or if it's just pure dumb luck, but the point is I'm not messing with that shit. She naps every single day from 12pm - 3pm and I NEED that time not only for my sanity but because I work from home and that's when I get a lot of stuff done. She is also out like a light at 7pm every night and my spouse and I get to be just husband and wife instead of dad and mom for the next few hours, and then she sleeps until 7am the next morning with no wake ups.\n\nAll I ever hear from some family members who had their kids decades ago is that I need to loosen up on the routine and let her try to nap in the stroller, let her take a few cat naps instead of her one long nap, put her to bed at 9pm instead of 7pm and she'll be \"fiiiiiiiinneeee!\" This is largely centered around them inviting us out to stuff that interferes with her nap or her bedtime (like mid-day festivals or firework shows on the 4th, for example) and me saying, \"Sorry, she naps during that time\" or \"Sorry, we have to be home at 6:30pm to start the bedtime routine.\" This is usually met with eyerolls and insinuations that I'm being a crazy first time mom, and recently I was also told I was spoiling her by giving her such a steady routine and she would have extreme anxiety with any change. (Sidenote here: her routine has shifted an hour or so a few times in the last due to circumstances outside of my control and she did just fine. No toddler panic attack!)\n\nI will find a nice but firm way to say this eventually but let me just vent it here right now instead - I AM NOT MESSING WITH MY KID'S SLEEP. Whatever we're doing right now is working out fine for us and I'm not rocking that boat at the moment, especially when I actually do need her to always nap for those three hours so I can go do my job that I get a steady paycheck for. Unless you want to come over and handle her at 9pm when she's screaming and exhausted, kindly STFU and just let me eat my ice cream and watch trashy reality tv show in peace at 7pm. ",

Have a bin for tops, a bin for bottoms, a bin for pjs/swimsuits/everything else, and only hang the tiny formalwear that actually gets wrinkled. The rest is jersey knits anyway! That way you can dump stuff straight from the dryer into bins without it sitting on the couch for a day first.\n\nIf you're pre-rinsing your silverware anyway, you can load the dishwasher with all the forks together, knives together, etc. Makes unloading 10x faster. (If you don't rinse, you risk all the spoons getting stuck together and then not actually getting clean.)\n\nCome on, mamas and papas, I know you've found tips and tricks. Share 'em.",

I drove her to the hospital because her husband, my son-in-law, was working an overnight shift. The plan was always to do that if she went into labor while he was gone, and she asked me many months ago if I would be in the delivery room with her. I said yes. \n\nLast night I stayed with her until he got there at midnight, and around 2 am, my daughter looked at me and opened her mouth to say something, then closed it and looked over at her husband. \n\nI asked if she wanted me to go, and give them some privacy. She breathed an audible sigh of relief and said yes, and when she started to apologize, I told her not to. I gave both her and my son-in-law a hug, and went home to sleep. In the morning I saw a text from her that she was still in labor, so I went over to her house to feed her dogs and let them out. \n\nI\u2019ve been here cleaning and preparing freezer meals since then, and when I\u2019m done I\u2019ll clean up the kitchen, feed the dogs again, and be on my way. When my grandchild is born, they\u2019ll let me know. I\u2019ll only come to the hospital if they ask, and I certainly won\u2019t come here unless they ask. \n\nI found this forum when I Googled \u2018what to do for daughter while she\u2019s in labor\u2019 and I\u2019ve learned a lot.

I can tell that you are so proud and you honestly have every right to be.\n\nOh, so and so's child walked out of the womb and was doing their taxes by age 3 months?  That's impressive.\n\nYou want to continue asking questions about my child just so you can talk about how you think your child is better?  Go on, I'm polite and will not interrupt you because that would be considered rude.\n\nIf we had carpet in our house he'd be crawling better?  No.  He's very content with army crawling and our pediatrician is very impressed with his leg strength.  She said he was just lazy.  We go out of our way to give him the opportunity to explore different environments but that doesn't matter.  It's a good thing our ancestors had carpeted caves otherwise we would have climbed right back up into the trees.\n\nUnfortunately I don't think bending down and shouting \"Walk!\" into his face will produce the results you want.\n\nNo, we're not worried.  We really truly love the fact that our son is delightfully average.  He's not behind.  He is hitting all of his milestones in the appropriate time frames.  Just because he doesn't hit it at what is considered the beginning of the average time frame does not mean he's slow.  \n\nI'd be really happy to tell you about how he's such a good eater and how Ferber worked really well for us but you are not interested in any of that because you don't have a story to one-up us on and it certainly doesn't make for any drama.\n\nThis is now the end of my rant...\n\nI thought this type of interaction was gone now that he's not \"new\" anymore and people generally seemed less interested.  I see now that it will always be something.\n\nThank you for reading.",

I ended up getting reusable wool ones\n\n-Any type of plastic toy with batteries just because I cannot stand toys with lights and sounds\n\n-Actual baby shoes (not moccasins). My kid didn't start really wearing shoes till they were like a year and a half old, they just used moccasins or bare feet till wintertime. They were cute, but a 4 month old does not actually need shoes.\n\n-A plastic baby fork and knife.

Our 6-month-old son is a very fussy, demanding, high-need baby that makes it difficult for me to do anything. This has been frustrating for my husband because \u201call I do\u201d is 24/7 childcare plus freelance work plus all household chores and cooking plus managing our finances. I\u2019m not interesting enough anymore. My hobbies started to fall by the wayside long before we had our son though...I\u2019ve been working 60-80 hours a week for years because I\u2019m the one with an established career and I had to pay for our wedding and honeymoon in Europe, plus make all the income while he went back to school and we had a baby on the way...I don\u2019t know what to do or think and it seems so unfair.

            "selftext": "Throwaway because I feel like it.\n\nMy baby girl is turning 1 in about a month. My husband's side of the family is coming for the big day, and everyone is very excited. I'm not particularly close to my in-laws, but mostly because distance has meant that I only see them about twice a year max. We don't have any kind of phone relationship either; just never happened. \n\nWhen my husband FaceTimes with his parents, his mom has apparently noticed that whenever my daughter notices me in the background, she won't want to look at FT anymore (I typically use that time to get some cooking or chores done). Which, yeah, she's a mama's girl. \n\nApparently, this bothers her a lot? She asked my husband if during the 5 days they are in our city (not staying with us), if I could \"make myself scarce\" to give the family time to bond with the baby. She thinks that if I'm there, my daughter will only want me to hold her. \n\nOn the one hand, yes, that's possible, especially at first. She is in a bad stranger danger phase and she hasn't seen my in-laws in person since she was 5 months old. She FTs with them a few times a week, but I'm not sure that will be enough for her to fully recognize them at this age. Whenever friends come over, if it's been awhile, she cries and clings to me until she starts to warm up (usually within 5-10 minutes); then she's all smiles and waves, toy sharing, etc. But it takes multiple meetings before she'll let a new friend hold her.\n\nBut on the other...I don't really want to make myself scarce during my daughter's birthday weekend? I'm not super intense about her birthday party, but it's a special time and it feels like I'm being shut out just because my MIL doesn't like the reminder that my daughter may not already 100% bonded to her. (Maybe a harsh take?) It would be one thing if she asked once or twice to get some special quality alone time with her, but the way she presented it made it seem like she *frequently* wanted me to keep my distance.\n\nMy husband is trying to positive-spin it, like \"oh think about all the long showers you can take and video games you can play!\" Which...sure. But again, it's the frequency and the implication about my role in the family that's giving me pause.\n\nBeing too sensitive? Yea or nay? You can tell me if I am. :)",

            "selftext": "Gonna get sooo many downvotes.\n\nI've been seeing more and more posts lately with moms who are at their wits end, trying to make the decisions that they feel are the best for their little ones and dodging backlash left and right. A week or so ago, a post was made where a mother let her child cry it out for three hours, and a response post was made wherein many other parents responded about how this is cruel, child abuse, negligent, etc.\n\nI just want to give a differing opinion, to reassure any lurkers with the best intentions that they're not abusing their child. This should be a safe place for us mommies and daddies, and personally if had read people's comments about how disgusting and sickening it is to let your child cry for three hours, I might not have sleep trained my daughter (which was the best decision as a mommy that I've ever made, for me AND her.)\n\n\nCOLIC.\n\n\nOur daughter was perfect for three-ish weeks, and then developed colic. I remember living with my mom post-partum, and thinking how *easy* this shit was. I'm a first time mom, so I expected poop explosions, temper tantrums, vomit, screaming, and everything in between. Our little potato slept pretty much all day, woke up to eat, maybe had half an hour total of time alert and awake and quiet in the daytime, slept at night pretty good between the 4 hour feedings.\n\nWe brought her home from Grandma's, and within a week she was an entirely different baby.\n\nAt one point, we took her to the ER because \"She won't stop crying.\"\n\nAt the height of her colic, she would not latch to eat, she would not stop crying, she did not nap, she hated everything that wasn't fast, repetitive movement. Her baby swing needed to be manually SHOVED to calm her down, a gentle swinging motion would not do it. I had to plant my feet on the support bars and PUSH it hard and fast. \n\nHer naps were 100% taken in this swing, while being pushed, hard, the entire time. It was EXHAUSTING. When she didn't want a nap, it was screaming in our arms for hours upon hours, often 12+ hours a day. She wanted to be walked in circles, surrounded by bright lights, us almost dancing as we paced. She liked being curled. Yes, like weight lifting. We curled our baby. \n\nWe could not leave the house, nothing worked. She screamed and screamed and screamed. We tried everything, I won't even list it all. Nothing worked. If you're curious, there's lots about it in my post history.\n\nANYWAYS. Sleep Training.\n\nAt four months, I was suicidal. I hated her. I couldn't do it anymore. So we decided to try Ferber. I put her in her crib (she was crying before I put her down, she kept crying after being put down) and checked on her every 5 minutes to pat her and talk to her. Eventually, I realized that was making her even more upset and myself as well, so I put in some earphones and watched her on the baby monitor.\n\nTHREE HOURS that night, she cried. And the only reason I dealt with it was because she had cried for 9 earlier that day anyways, and I kept telling my self \"If she's crying all day in my arms, three hours at night will be okay.\" \n\nShe fell asleep. She woke up later that night, and I couldn't do it again. I let her co-sleep with me as we usually did for the rest of the night.\n\nThe next day, I put her down in her crib at bedtime. She cried for as long as it took me to walk out of the room and close the door. She slept through the night for the first time that night. (excluding 2 nighttime bottles, which she went to bed immediately afterwards with no fuss)\n\nEVERY SINGLE NIGHT SINCE she has fallen asleep with absolutely zero issues. Her naptimes are the same. It doesn't matter what house we're in, it doesn't matter who's putting her to bed whether it's me or aunty or grandma. You take her, you put her in a bed, give her her blanket (and play a bit of peekaboo) she will smile at you, stick her thumb in her mouth, pull the blankey up to her face and sleep. \n\nDuring the day she is a GLORIOUS WONDER. She is NEVER grumpy, except when she is sick. If she is fussing, it's because she is either hungry or tired. \n\nSleep training helped us beat colic. \n\n\"Cry it out\" for three hours one night saved us countless hours of tears since.\n\nOur daughter is finally getting the tummy time she needs, because we couldn't do it while she was colicky.\n\nShe's healthy, 75% weight, hitting milestones just fine. She gives me the biggest smile every morning, and I know she loves me.\n\nI didn't teach her that I wouldn't come to her when she cries. She cries for me when she's hungry, she cries when Daddy puts her down for a nap before she's tired (and then we just pick her back up, say \"oops!\" and give her another 15-20 minutes to tire herself out.) She cries for me when she bonks her head. \n\nFrom the opinions I see here, I am an absolute monster for letting my child cry for three hours when she's so little. I will *never* regret it. I don't know where I'd be without it. My daughter is HAPPIER and HEALTHIER because of sleep training, and so am I. Who knows whether or not I'd even still be alive if we had to deal with colic any longer.\n\nI guess my point is; mommas, you know your children. Trust your instincts. Don't let other people's opinions stop you from doing what you need for the health of both you and your baby. It's not always black and white, a sleep-trainer isn't always malicious. Someone \"ignoring\" their baby is not always neglectful. Life happens, we all do what we can to survive it. And if to survive life and raise your infant you need to sleep train them early, then ignore the naysayers and do what is best for your family. \n",

            "selftext": "Cursing ahead, be forewarned.\n\nI hate my fucking dogs today. We live on ten acres. Ten. But where do they decide to post up to bark at all the birds that fly in the air above our property? Right. Outside. The baby\u2019s. Window. I JUST got her to sleep, and I know this because I started a stopwatch on my phone to track how long she sleeps. Wanna guess how long she made it before my two asshole dogs woke her up? 7 fucking minutes. Every day with this shit. \n\nI don\u2019t love my dogs anymore. I don\u2019t even *like* them anymore. They\u2019re shitty little assholes.\n\nThese dogs have had it made. We\u2019ve taken them all over: backpacking, camping, on road trips to Mexico. I have adorable photos of my husband kayaking with one of our dogs perched on the bow of the kayak, while she\u2019s trying to decide if the pod of dolphins below the surface are slippery pupper friends or water demons to be chased. (She decided they were friends but was disappointed when they didn\u2019t stay to play after she crashed into the water with all the grace of a newborn giraffe) When I was pregnant, they became ultra protective of me. I couldn\u2019t walk anywhere without a two-dog escort. I tried so hard to keep things normal for them when the baby came, but they got so strange around me that it just didn\u2019t happen. They didn\u2019t want to sit with me on the couch, they didn\u2019t want to cuddle with me, and they seemed to have extra anxiety when around me at all. It honestly hurt my feelings to be so plainly rejected. They stand to attention the second my husband walks through the door, and he\u2019s the only one they obey at this point. If I called them for dinner or to come inside, they would ignore me until I walked around the property and they actually saw me. If my husband calls them? Instant obedience. I tried offering treats when they would obey me or came when I called them, but even food isn\u2019t enough of an incentive to elicit obedience anymore.\n\nI would never get rid of them, they don\u2019t deserve to be thrown away like that. They are Australian Cattle Dogs, and living on property with lots of things to do and people to interact with is basically as ideal a situation for that breed that they\u2019ll ever get outside of actually being working dogs. I want to emphasize that again: *This is not going to result in my dogs being dumped at a shelter or sold off a Craigslist ad. I am a responsible pet owner and would never abandon my animals because of behavioral issues that pose no danger to anyone. They were never substitute babies to be thrown away now that I have a \u201creal baby\u201d. Don\u2019t tell me I\u2019m a bad person or a bad pet owner because I\u2019m venting and asking for advice.*\n\nBut I also can\u2019t stand the sight of them anymore, and I feel like I never want anything to do with them ever again. I make my husband feed them and put them to bed because I just can\u2019t. It hurts when I try to interact with them and they are totally disinterested in doing so, so I\u2019ve stopped trying. I interpret everything they do as a deliberate attempt to disrespect or subvert me. I don\u2019t know what to do. Is this hormonal? I can\u2019t imagine ever loving those stupid fuckers ever again, but maybe this will pass. Any insight here? ",

But even if they didn't, they didn't give a flying fart. \n\nI remember posting here and being devastated when I would receive snarky comments or be downvoted for a question. I would immediately delete my post out of anxiety and embarrassment. I was a first time mom with no family around, I didn't know what I was doing (still don't) so BTB was my main resource. For every three downvotes though, I'd get a helpful response or someone to say \"you're not alone, me too!\" Which is basically a warm embrace via internet. \n\nI posted here yesterday about the always controversial (why?) subject of sleep and got downvotes out the wazoo. But, I didn't care. \nWhen my child throws a stage five fit on the sidewalk that garners judgmental stares, I don't care. \nStrangers giving me unsolicited advice garners a giggle rather than anger. \n\nI say this to let you know, those of you that are in the trenches of being a new mom, soon you won't care either. You are doing the best you know how to do for your baby and that is more than enough. Your kid thinks the sun rises and sets on you, who cares what the grumpy woman at Target thinks? The family members who make snarky comments, aren't there when you're deep in the shits (sometimes literally) at two am. You are. Try not to get too caught up in other people's thoughts. You're doing a great job and you're not alone. You'll get your sea legs soon. There are a ton of parents here who have been there, just wade through the downvotes and eye rolls. We'll catch you on the other side. Promise. ",

He does sleep for 8-10 hours straight but we have been trying to adjust to figure out how to get him to sleep past four.  \n\nLast night I tried putting him to sleep at 6pm. Normally he goes to bed a bit later (7-8pm depending on the day), but you know they always say sleep begets sleep or something, idk. He woke up at 4. I rolled over and turned off the monitor to see what would happen. He put himself back to sleep and woke up at 6! He cried a little bit, but not for very long. Even though the monitor was off, I can hear when he's really crying because his bedroom is next to ours. He's a lot less cranky this morning. \n\nI've been posting about my struggles on another site, with \"baby\" in its title. I posted about how I let him essentially cry himself back to sleep (he whined for maybe 15 minutes at 4, alternating between crying and playing with his aquarium) and someone said CPS should be called on me for not attending to my baby's cries and leaving him a wet diaper for 10 hours. I must have done this to him before, she said, because the only reason he went back to sleep is because he knew I wasn't coming for him. She said I was abusing him.  \n\nI've been crying all morning about this comment, imagining my son thinking I've abandoned him. I've never let him cry for more than MAYBE 15 minutes when I knew he was tired and was going to fall asleep any minute.  \n\nI dunno what I'm looking for but I'm just so sad to think that someone thinks I'm abusing my kid. Was what I did really that horrible??",

            "selftext": "I'm really trying hard to not sound privileged or pretentious in this post. Please see it this way.\n\nI understand that I am very lucky and that a lot of people have no choice and need to work full time. I don't mean to come across as bragging or anything like that at all. I just...I don't know what is best.\n\nFtm, 37+2. I work part time (18 hours per week...3 days, 6 hours each) at a law office as a Paralegal. I love my job, it's easy, I have my own office, and have been there 5 years. It's super laid back.\nI used to work full time but as soon as I got pregnant I was able to job share with another part timer and it works great.\n\nThe plan was to go back to work after 14 weeks of maternity leave and work for only 12 hours a week, two days at 6 hours. There is a daycare 1.3 miles away from my office and we had put a deposit down back in February for a spot.\n\nThe downside is that I will literally be losing $100/paycheck or $194/month paying for daycare. My husband is able to support us financially on his own with lots of room to spare so if I wanted to do this, it would be fine. \n\nMy reasons for wanting to continue working are ...selfish, at least that is what my husband thinks.\n\nI work with my best friend, I like all my coworkers, I love my window office, the work is easy and I can easily just sit and have coffee for an hour and still get my work done, there are no deadlines for my type of work. \n\nFinancially my husband makes like 10 times more so I don't *have* to work but honestly I like it and I feel like I'd need time away from baby. I could get my nails or hair done before I pick up the baby once a month or so. \n\nPlus I think the baby would want time away too.\n\nMy husband is very stuck on me raising the baby, fully and is afraid that baby will get sick from other kids at daycare, that they won't take care of him as well as I would, etc. Plus every woman in his family is a sahm, and even when their kids went to school they did not return to work...they didn't have to. So in his mind it's also a status thing and a provider thing. Which we could do too.\n\nHe thinks I will be able to get all of my adult interaction with mommy groups. I disagree. I'm 27, he is 30 and none of our friends have kids... except two but they both work 2 jobs each to make ends meet and wouldn't be available to hang out. And we all know how hard it is to make friends. I do plan on going to those mommy and me groups at the hospital and library but I just don't make friends easily. I'm shy at first and well, quite opinionated/critical (I'm working on it) when you get to know me. \n\nI do see his point and while a *big* part of me has always wanted to be a sahm and not work, a part of me wants to keep a part of my identity. You know?\n\nWhat to do? What would you do?",

Its usually a pleasant event much like any other family dinner we have. With a 10mo old in tow now (hey, happy first moms day to me!) it feels like a giant obligational event instead, especially since a brunch got added to the day's events due to an ailing family member (who we can't skip seeing). \n\nI'm having a very selfish \"great for the rest of them, but what about MEEEE!?\" moment. IDGAF about someone wishing me a happy mother's day, or doing something fancy. I want a legit day to myself (where I inevitably clean the house, and cook things, and organize spaces still...but I get to do it ALONE. IN PEACE.) I'm just so not interested in being celebrated as a mom by being 'gifted' a full day of activities outside the house, planning logistics, stressing about naptimes and mealtimes, changing diapers on the fly wherever we possibly can find a convenient spot to do it, being pleasant on 4 hours of sleep, and OH -- looking flawless when I only had 15 minutes to get ready and a barely-fits wardrobe. I don't even have a normal bra that fits, so my entire ensemble will need to work with a racerback sports bra.\n\nMaybe I'm just salty this year, but I feel like Mother's day should be re-branded to \"take everyone away from me and leave me alone\" day.\n\nBut seriously. Happy Mother's Day everyone. We're all rockstars for taking on this insanity willingly ;) ",

            "selftext": "I just wanted to post an encouraging post about sleep training. At our 4 month appointment my husband and I got the a-ok from our pediatrician to try sleep training. We were really nervous but we knew we needed something. My son before this time would ONLY sleep on us, in a baby carrier, after being rocked aggressively in the dark with a sound machine with a pacifier for at least an hour, and you would have to continue to be upright in movement for another hour minutes for him to be in deep sleep. It was really hard on us, because bedtime would usually fall to me, and by the time I was done with this whole act- it would be my bedtime. I was exhausted with very little downtime.\n\nWe skimmed the book Healthy Sleep Habits Happy Child by Marc Weissbluth, and although we didn't really think it helped, it helped motivate both of us to not break down and enter the room. We did the method of extinction, where you make sure the baby is all prepped and ok, and basically leave him for the night. We also made the switch from rock and play to crib at the same time. We watched our son completely confused and cry HARD for upwards for 3 hours the first night- and it was the hardest thing I've done in my life. Harder than natural childbirth and the weeks of painful breastfeeding- anything. Nothing will grip you like the sound of your child crying for hours. Our son was also around the 11th percentile for weight- I literally thought he had lost weight due to all his crying. We could not find anyone's child who cried as long as ours had online, but we really didn't want to enter the room and negate all the crying our son had already done. I thought I could just turn off my mind and watch some netflix, take a shower etc- but i literally could not tear my eyes off watching my baby cry on the monitor for 3 hours. \n\nThe next night- 15 minutes of crying then sleep, the next night was back to 2 hours. We were confused why it went back up to two hours, but didn't know what else to do. We started doubting the book, but eventually decided to press on, and I'm so happy we did. Within a week less than 15 min of grumbling and a month out, very rarely any bedtime grumbling. We tried to tackle naps at the same time as well, and those were not showing any improvement. We stopped attempting extinction for the naps, however 4 days after starting bedtime extinction, we tried extinction for the naps again and miraculously he soothed himself for a daytime nap!\n\nSleep training was incredible for us- he started eating better (is now up to the 23rd percentile for weight), weaned himself from his pacifier, weaned himself from night feeds and loves his crib. I can't recommend it enough. It's almost impossible with only one person, my husband and I leaned on each other heavily, preventing each other and reminding we were trying to do what's best for the baby. Extinction takes a lot of discipline and strength, but you can do it!",

Ah, I don't know.\"\n\nMe: \"You've known me for 10 years. I'm sure it'll be great. Plus, surprises.\"\n\nG: \"It's something we can both use. It's for the kitchen but you'll never guess what it is.\"\n\nMe: \"I'm going to stop you before you go any further and remind you that I pushed a human through my vagina.\"\n\nG: \"I don't want you to judge right away okay? Hear me out. Someone suggested this.\"\n\nMe: \"Okay I'm going to close my eyes so I won't react.\"\n\nG: \"Okay...so a premium...top of the line...state of the art...\"\n\nMe: *Oh no. Buries face behind my hair*\n\nG: \"Pepper mill.\"\n\nMe: Silence....then BURSTS into laughter. \n\nG: \"Babe, you don't get it. The kind where you get BIG flakes of fresh pepper.\"\n\nMe: *Oh my good god, this is not a joke.*\nTears are streaming down my face. \"Absolutely not.\" \"Also, I'm going to tell people about this.\"\n\nG: \"When you do, like, emphasize it's the best quality pepper mill out there.\"\n\nTLDR: Husband wants to gift me a pepper mill, I'm sending myself to the spa. \n\nPlease share with me the lamest Mothers Day gift you've received - or almost received! \n",

            "selftext": "So this story is funny but I just can\u2019t stop thinking about it and it\u2019s insidious sexism. \nSo my SIL has a 3 year old boy. She was regaling me and one of her friends with the morning\u2019s antics. Basically he came screeching into the room yelling about how there was a hole in his bum. He had discovered his butt hole people. And he was rather upset and alarmed bless him.\n\nSo my SIL says \u2018at least with girls you two don\u2019t have to deal with that sort of thing\u2019 her friend agrees and I\u2019m all \u2018errr girls do have butt holes too you know?!\u2019 \n\nThe assumption that there will be in inbuilt switch in my girls brain that will tell her what is appropriate to say or do or exactly what her butt hole is and that she shouldn\u2019t touch it all the time etc etc because she\u2019s a girl? Eh? I mean if anything she\u2019s got more holes down there to be curious and potentially frightened about!\n\nIt\u2019s petty,  it\u2019s silly but I also feel it\u2019s a perfect example of being shocked at a girl potentially having the same silly, gross impulses as a boy. Girls are gross too! I know because I am one! I\u2019m pretty fucking gross y\u2019all.\n\nAll children have no awareness of their body then they become aware at about 3 and start to ask questions as explore.\n\nPeople might have examples of their boy being one way and their girl another but I really think it\u2019s down personality types and maaaaaybe just maybe it\u2019s down to the messages we send our girls and boys through language and play? There was a study I read once (sorry that\u2019s a rubbish citation I know) that said we let baby boys mess on more and get away with more stuff than we do with baby girls. (Letting them crawl everywhere, poking, prodding and scratching babies the same age etc etc) then of course there\u2019s the colours and \u2018boys don\u2019t do that, girls don\u2019t do that that\u2019 that is often skewed towards girls being less (you throw like a girl being an insult for example) \n\nI want my girl to be curious, to ask questions, to be silly, to be gross and I feel defensive and sensitive when she\u2019s only 9 months old that I may have to defend her personality if she is that way.\nI won\u2019t have anyone telling her she has to be a certain way because she\u2019s a girl and I\u2019d feel the same if I had a boy in that I wouldn\u2019t stand for anyone telling him to be a certain way because of his sex. \n\nDoes anyone else have funny, stories about girls being funny and gross?! \n\nSorry that turned out long!

I know I\u2019m not as cool as I once was, but I still want a social life. Just because I\u2019m not the drink wine with the girls and get my nails done type, I still want a Mom group locally.

I feel like stores are full of clothes that make toddlers look like tiny adults and I know several of my friends with kids love those outfits (and really, there's nothing wrong with that!), but I just feel like they will only be little kids for a such a short part of their lives and I love dressing my son in bright colours and loose fitting comfy baby/toddler clothes while I can! \n\n\n\nOn the same note.. was searching for \"colourful  kids rooms\" on Pinterest the other day and a large number of the results were gray/white/neutral bedrooms.... I know it's all about trends and all, but I just miss colours! All my friends are buying houses and painting all the walls white/gray and I just can't wait until I finally get my own house where I can paint the walls and ceilings all the colours I want!\n\n\n\nOk, colour rant over... haha",

            "selftext": "I'm almost 4 months in and here are some things I wish people would have been honest with me about when saying \"having a newborn is hard\". I'm sure I'll have another list in a few months with some new challenges we pick up on the way! \n\nDisclaimers:\n\n- This is my personal experience. \n- This is my real talk and not really sugar coated. If you're a pregnant FTM and don't want to hear it, don't continue reading.\n- I understand not everyone goes through the same things.\n\n**Nighttime feeding**\n\nGetting up every 2 to 3 hours didn't sound so bad to me when anticipating LOs arrival. \n\n\"I'll only be up for 30 to 40 min and then I'll just drift off to sleep for 1.5 to 2 hours\" is what I would say to myself. \n\nFor the first few weeks, that was so far from reality and it was exhausting. What really happened - baby would nurse for 30 to 40 min and then I'd spend another 30 to 60 min rocking him back to sleep. This would leave me with an hour of sleep, maybe two if I was lucky (and could immediately fall asleep again), before baby was up again to do the same thing. \n\nI can still remember the first time I put him back in his bassinet after a nighttime nursing session and he just immediately fell asleep and stayed asleep. I thought there was something toxic in my milk that made him drowsy... But then it became a trend! \n\nI've probably just jinxed myself as we approach 4 mo and all I hear about is the dreaded sleep regression. \n\n**Sleeping when the baby sleeps**\n\nThis sounds great in theory. But when my baby would only sleep on me in the first couple of months and I was home alone and didn't have someone to supervise safe sleeping, it was nearly impossible to actually sleep. I could doze off and kick my feet up, but never actually sleep. Until this day, even if my baby is safely sleeping in his crib, I cannot actually sleep unless there is another adult in the house. \n\n**Cluster feeding**\n\n\"Babies eat every 2 to 3 hours\" is what I was constantly told. This is bullshit, especially when going through a growth spurt. If you feed your baby on demand, as I do, babies eat whenever the fuck they want. Add a growth spurt to that and you are permanently affixed to your couch for 2 to 3 hours in the evening with a baby constantly attached to the boob. \n\nWhen cluster feeding at 2, 3 and 5 weeks old, my baby would nurse for 10 min, fall asleep for 10 min, nurse for 10 min, fall asleep and repeat for 3 hours every night. It doesn't sound hard until you're living it. But it's OK. It's short lived and you can watch so much TV in that time guilt free. \n\n**Obsessive behaviour**\n\nI think all moms have at least one thing they constantly obsess over with their baby - whether it be how much baby is eating, baby's weight gain, sleep patterns, or if their baby is hitting developmental milestones.\n\nFor me, it is sleep. I cannot believe how obsessed I have become with making sure my baby is sleeping enough. It really is an exhausting obsession and so incredibly stressful. I cannot even imagine what it would be like to have a baby who \"just falls asleep when they're tired\". I'm pretty sure my baby has serious FOMO and getting him to sleep is a circus act. \n\nWhatever your obsession ends up being, it will consume you and it will feel like parenting is just getting your baby to do X, and nothing else. \n\n**Mom guilt**\n\nThe amount of guilt I have felt since pushing this baby out is insurmountable. If he cries, I feel like I've done something wrong and it's all my fault. I constantly remind myself that he has no other way to communicate with me, but man, the crying is hard. \n\nAnd let's talk about the first time you unintentionally hurt your baby. For me, it was clipping his finger while trying to cut his nails. He cried for maybe 2 minutes. I cried for 2 hours. \n\nI so desperately want to do everything right for my baby, but honestly, sometimes I don't know what he needs from me and so I go through the checklist - hungry, dirty, gassy, bored, tired - and if none of those are the issue I just hold him a little tighter and hope he'll stop crying. \n\nBut when he doesn't stop crying, I get so incredibly frustrated. And that makes me feel guilty too. He's just a baby, I need to help him, but the crying is frustrating. Only once so far have I had to put the baby down while crying and go take a break. I lasted 4 minutes and felt like the worst mother on the planet when I went back in and he was still crying. \n\n**Things will never be the same**\n\nI would always say \"a baby isn't going to change me or my marriage that much\". This was naive. I now have another person who I have to consider 100% of the time. I can't just drop what I'm doing and run out to do X. I have to coordinate it. As long as whoever is watching baby has a pumped bottle, I'm free to go wherever I want, but the fact that I have to plan and prepare this is more than I had anticipated when pregnant. \n\nAnd how about the fact that your baby basically consumes all your thoughts, all of the time? I think since I've had my baby, I've maybe caught myself half a dozen times thinking about something completely unrelated to him. Even if I'm out doing something for myself, I'm thinking of him and how we're growing as a family. Am I doing the right things for him? Is he taking a bottle OK from dad? Where will we go for our family vacation? Are we royally screwing him up and is he inheriting our mental health issues? How do I keep him safe in the summer heat so we can still enjoy the outdoors?, etc. \n\nI wouldn't say my marriage has changed much, aside from the fact that I love and appreciate my husband even more than I already did. And I think (and hope) he feels the same. It really is a team effort, but the 1-2 hours we get alone together each night after LO goes to bed feel incredibly more precious than our childless evenings together. However, there are times where I feel resentful of my husband as he's not as tied down to baby as I am since LO is EBF. \n\n**Having a baby is like having your heart walk outside your body**\n\nI will say that I wasn't truly in love with my baby until maybe about 8 weeks. I loved him in the sense that he is my family and I will protect him, but I didn't have this overwhelming sense of love for him. \n\nBut let me tell you, whenever it is that you fall in love with your baby - whether it be 2 months or 2 years - the love is FIERCE. It's probably the reason for all the mom guilt.",

            "selftext": "I\u2019d like to begin by saying that he\u2019s perfectly fine, thank goodness. He\u2019s asleep next to me and his baby brother. Although I\u2019m very embarrassed and feeling like a shitty mom I want to share this in the hopes that it doesn\u2019t happen to anyone else. \n\nAlso forgive my crappy English. \nOkay so to the story. My son is 3 years old. He\u2019s had a runny nose for about 3 days now but he\u2019s had a cold many times before so I didn\u2019t get too concerned. Today, however, my mom called me (she watches him while I go to school) and told me he was feverish and shivering. So I immediately went to pick him up. My mom suggested I take him to the hospital but I decided to call his pediatrician instead. Took his temperature and it was 104 F \n\nThe receptionist said they would call me in an hour or less so I was trying to give my son liquids and put a rag on his forehead. I decided to stay at my moms so she can help me keep an eye on the baby (7 months). She said she didn\u2019t have Tylenol but I was thought that maybe he could wait until the dr called back. (1st fuck up, I should have gone to my house to get the Tylenol) \n\nSo about a half hour later I decide to just take him to the ER since the dr hasn\u2019t called me back and he\u2019s saying his whole body hurts. I pack up the kids and called my husband to meet me there but instead I go to pick him up. At this point my son has been feverish for 1 hour and 25 minutes. I\u2019m almost to the hospital and the nurse  calls me and says \u201che doesn\u2019t need to go to the ER, take him home, give him Tylenol and put him in a warm bath, bring him in at 4 pm today\u201d (2 hours away) \n\n20 minutes later we get home, I immediately give him Tylenol and then strip him and put him in a bath. He\u2019s his usual playful self. Husband was taking out the dog. I tell my son to get out of the tub so I can put him in some PJs and he says no mommy 5 more minutes. He holds his breath and dips his face in the water and takes it out and laughs. Husband walks in and says he has to send an email, I tell him to take my car to go get his laptop while my son naps. He says no. (Conversation took about 8 seconds. I have my back to my son and my husband is facing the tub but looking at me) (2nd fuck up) \n\nNever take your eyes away from your kids. After these 8 seconds I turned around and told my son \u201ccome on buddy times up\u201d and he\u2019s face down in the tub. I immediately think he\u2019s playing around like usual but then notice he\u2019s \u201cbreathing\u201d underwater. I yelled to my husband to get him out since I\u2019m holding our infant and he immediately pulls him out. My son was completely purple. He had a seizure right in front of us and we were fucking talking. \n\nHusband knows cpr so he\u2019s tending to our son while I\u2019m calling 911. 20 seconds late my son is throwing up water and food everywhere. He wakes up. \n\nAs I\u2019m talking to him his eyes roll to the back of his head. He\u2019s not talking to me. Then the paramedics show up and as they walk in he pukes up a lot of water then cries. \n\nIt was the most terrifying moment of my life. I keep thinking about the way he looked when my husband took him out. It was just a few seconds that we looked away and this happened. I feel terrible for parents who lose their kids to drowning now I know what they mean by it takes seconds for a kid to drown. \n\nThe paramedics left and by the time they were gone it was time for us to take him to the pediatrician. His vitals were perfect, no fluid in his lungs. No flu, no strep. We don\u2019t know what made his fever so high but now I know NEVER to let his fever get that high again. Dr said that seizures are very common with high fevers and it just happened at the worst time ever. \n\nThe drive home was so quiet between my husband and I. He\u2019s acting so quiet. We both know we almost lost our son. We were both there. But he saved his life. I don\u2019t know what I would have done if I would have been on my own. \n\n\nI\u2019m feeling physically ill. My whole body hurts. I feel like crying but since husband is acting like whatever I\u2019m scared. When we got home my son ate a huge meal and was back to normal. I\u2019m monitoring his fever all night and alternating Motrin and Tylenol. I\u2019m so thankful that he\u2019s breathing next to me and snoring. \n\n\nLearned an important lesson about fever seizures ( never thought it would happen to my son) dr did lecture me about letting his fever fun for so long. He said next time to give him medicine right away \n\n\nEDIT- TLDR: 3 year old got fever seizure while in the tub and almost drowned right in front of me and my husband because we thought he was playing around. He\u2019s fine now ",

She was losing calories through her efforts. We used syringes and a supplemental nursing system. She still lost weight. We switched to bottles (under the care of a lactation consultant) and I continued to nurse at night time - she still lost weight. I switched to nursing her for \"comfort only\" so she'd still remember how to do it. She STILL lost weight. We started fortifying with formula (under the care of our pediatrician) and she finally gained weight! And then ... she lost weight again. She tested positive for blood in her diaper, and was diagnosed (by a GI doctor) with severe reflux and a milk protein sensitivity. I did the no-dairy, no-soy diet, fortified with Nutramigen and thickened. Finally ... she is gaining weight! But after all this, I don't nurse much anymore because she will spit up and be miserable without the thickened mix. \n\nI stupidly asked for guidance about the sensitivity on a local but very large breastfeeding page. I have gotten back: \n- Why do you give your baby formula? \n- Just nurse through the allergy\n- I question whether her allergy exists (this was from an IBLC) \n- She probably isn't allergic; babies just cry sometimes\n- Your milk will heal her! \n- All babies spit up\n- That little bit of (XYZ) you ate won't hurt her\n- You should work with an IBLC to work out her issues so you can continue on your \"breastfeeding journey.\" \n\nI just ... UGH! I am SO jealous of moms who can just feed their babies straight from their boobs. I HATE pumping. I hate having to be constantly paranoid about my supply. I hate having to mix the formula with the milk. I hate having to thicken it. I feel like freakin' Walter White in my kitchen mixing this crap up. I hate that my baby will scream in agony while also being hungry if I slip up and accidentally eat dairy. And I hate the assumption that I'm doing all of this because I don't want to breastfeed or because I haven't gotten \"proper\" help from an IBLC. (And also, if a mom doesn't want to breastfeed, that's her prerogative.) I have been to so many lactation appointments that I literally have lost count. My doctor's office has two full-time on staff! \n\nAnd yeah, people can be stupid or opinionated on facebook (esp when I asked for opinions.) But how is it in ANY way professional for an IBLC (who is ostensibly commenting in her professional role) to try to diagnose a stranger in a way that directly contradicts my pediatrician and GI doctor? \n\nUgh.

            "selftext": "So to preface this rant, we are not going to rehome our cats or put them down or stop feeding them or anything like that.\n\nBut.\n\nMan they are so goddamn annoying. \n\nMy cat has been clingy, loud and annoying since day one, but has also been my good buddy and at 14 is becoming an old dude. He is constantly trying to lay on top of any part of my body that might be available, even when I am nursing the baby. He will meow for hours, often starting at 5am or maybe 2:30pm or maybe 11:30pm, and has on multiple occasions woken the baby from her nap by walking up to her and meowing in her face. He is always underfoot.\n\nMy SO's cat has entirely different problems. This cat does not meow, but is constantly sneezing big goobers all over the house. He will walk up to you just to sneeze directly in your face. He wants to be petted, but will also randomly bite you because he just doesn't know how to cat very well (my SO adopted him from the shelter knowing about this behavior problem).\n\nThey are both constantly jumping up on the counters when we aren't looking and fighting with each other and crawling all over us and I KNOW. THEY ARE JUST BEING CATS. And I know they are starved for attention now that we have this baby. But we both feel like our lives would be so much more pleasant without them. Ugh, thanks for listening. (and I'm not really looking for suggestions about how to deal with them, because we are honestly doing ok, but feel free to commiserate)",

            "selftext": "We took my kids to an Easter Egg hunt at a park about 20 minutes away. The hunt was supposed to start at 11am, so we got there at 10:30am. Had some free donuts, played on the slide, took some pictures with the Easter bunny. It was nice.    \n\nAbout 10 minutes before it was supposed to start, they put the eggs out. It was divided into age groups, 0-2, 3-5, etc. My husband said he would take my son to the 3-5 age group, and I could take my daughter to the 0-2. So everyone starts lining up when the woman in charge gets on the loudspeaker and says that it will be AT LEAST another half an hour. Uh, okay.    \n\nSo when it is finally time, I take my daughter to her egg hunt. It is absolute chaos. Parents carry their babies like footballs, running to grab eggs.... I tried putting my daughter down to let her get some eggs, but she is totally surrounded by people and starts freaking out. Oh well. I take her aside so we can watch my son.    \n\nWell, they tell the parents that they are not allowed in, and only 3-5 eggs per kid. They swear that there are PLENTY of eggs. Should be fine, right?    \n\nParents start pushing through the giant crowd and push their kids to the front of the line and yell, \"GRAB AS MANY EGGS AS YOU CAN!!\" When they tell the kids to go, the parents don't listen and run in there with them. Kids start getting pushed down, they grab eggs out of kids' hands... at the end of it all, which was like probably two minutes, most kids are in the grass crying because they don't have any eggs. My son only got one egg. I saw three kids, a little girl and two little boys, and their baskets are FULL of eggs, to the brim. I mean, at LEAST 30 eggs. The parents high five the kids and start opening up all the eggs in front of the crying children.    \n\nTurns out 4 eggs had \"golden tickets\" in them, and if you found a golden ticket, you got an Easter basket. Really? So a free basket of crap is worth making poor kids cry in the grass? Freaking animals. So many parents were pissed.    \n\nEdit: I just have to share this picture.

Apparently that message didn\u2019t get through and she just couldn\u2019t control herself. \n\nSo now I am greeted by a photo DH sent to her for her own viewing pleasure, accompanied by a post that does not include my name, but my son\u2019s full name and date of birth, all so she can brag to her friends. \n\nIt\u2019s late at night here. I\u2019ve tried calling. I\u2019ve texted her to take it down. I am beside myself. It doesn\u2019t matter my reasons, what matters is that I am not being respected as a parent. Thanks Mum.

Replied with all this emotional manipulation bull about how grandparents need to share that excitement and it\u2019s jus what we do and all her friends and family are on Facebook. Funny how my dad managed to get the word out and he doesn\u2019t even use social media. \nShe then had the nerve to tell me \u2018As your mother I might just remind you that all of us get hormonal and emotional at these times, including me.\u2019 Thanks for invalidating a huge change in my life, Mum.

It just never came in.\n\nSave me your stories of women who pumped every two hours around the clock for two months in order to protect their supply. If these women even exist they must have been driven to the brink of insanity if not pushed right over the edge.\n\nIn what planet does making me even more sleep deprived and stressed out make me a better mother?\n\nI am not a bad mother because my milk didn\u2019t come in. \n\nYou should have told me this. Everyone should have been telling me this. All. The. Time.\n\nInstead you told me to tape a tube next to my nipple and put the other end of the tube in the formula and somehow latch the baby correctly and somehow hold the formula above my head so it can feed down. \u201cThis way the baby will know that milk comes from mom.\u201d\n\nWhen I bewilderedly ask what kind of formula to use - the reply: \n\nMeh, formula is formula. It\u2019s all the same.  \n\nThe implication of course being that there is no substitute for breast milk. Except that there is, and it\u2019s formula.\n\nI wish everyone would have been as supportive as they claimed to be.\n\nSaying FED IS BEST isn\u2019t enough.\n\nTalk to me about bottles - there\u2019s about 15 different kinds at Target alone.\n\nEducated me on formula - there is so much to know and learn!\n\nShow me how to feed my child with a bottle, how to hold him, how to hold the bottle, how to pace him if needed.\n\nFormula feeding isn\u2019t just shoving a bottle in his face and calling it a day.\n\nAnd for the love of everything please stop it with the statistics on breastfeeding. A lot the benefits being cited are over blown / taken out of context plus I don\u2019t have have any milk. The guilt and stress you are making feel wont produce any. \n\nBreastfeeding isn\u2019t motherhood.",

She is always spending time with the children in the family and it\u2019s pretty obvious she wants a baby of her own. I had a baby in October and she has been all over her, but this past week I feel.. weird. She &amp; her husband  were staying at my house due to a family emergency and I caught a couple of weird moments. Once her husband was carrying my baby and she started fussing.. I walked into the room when she said \u201cgive her to me.. she wants to come to mommy.\u201d When she saw me walk in she looked very surprised and then quickly changed the subject. I felt like I was walking in on their fantasy. Another time I was taking a shower and when I stepped out I heard she was talking on the phone with someone else and said \u201cIt\u2019s more like I\u2019m the mom and she\u2019s (me) the nanny.. she (my baby) only wants to be with her when she\u2019s hungry, other than that she\u2019s happier with me and (her husband).\u201d I confronted her about this and she said she was just joking around. I\u2019m breastfeeding, but I have started pur\u00e9e and cereals. I asked her to let me do anything with feeding because I feel more comfortable doing so but most days she would already be feeding her and tell me \u201cyou won\u2019t have to breastfeed her anymore soon, I\u2019m giving her all she needs.\u201d Today she came over and she grabbed my baby and she says \u201cwow she looks so sad now that she doesn\u2019t see me all day.\u201d  And she is always trying to correct me, I dress in her pants she says I should have put on a dress or vise versa.. These are just some of the moments that have bothered me the most but she is always doing or saying something like that and when I confront her she either says I\u2019m being ungrateful or plays it off as a joke. Am I being mean in wishing she would stop all this? I do appreciate her help but I think she can also be extremely intrusive but I don\u2019t want to be mean.. ",

            "selftext": "This is mostly a rant, but I'm also looking for a little advice.\n\nI am extremely frustrated with both my in-laws and my husband. They are insisting that we travel away from our home, friends, and MY family to celebrate our baby's first birthday this summer in their home. Their reasoning is that it's only \"fair\" because they've missed the other big moments (um, who's fault is that?? They are retired and we've offered our home to them and to pay for their travel, and they've *refused*...and they got two weeks over Christmas) and that they want to plan the party.\n\nFirst of all, *I* want my husband and I to plan her party. It's more for us than for her anyway! Second of all, my in-laws are weird about my parents and wouldn't want them to come down for the party (plus my parents work). And I'm sorry, but my parents have actually *been there* for our daughter, almost every single day. They effing deserve to be a major part of the celebration of her first birthday. \n\nAnd you know what, my in-laws are also her grandparents and that is why we'd be thrilled to host them if they'd suck up their pride and actually come down. But if my MiL refuses to let us pay for her plane tickets and refuses to buy them herself? Well then that's how it goes, sorry we'll be missing you at the celebration. That's the cost of your pride, lady.\n\nBut they've been laying on the guilt with my husband and now he's worried about their lifespan (they're in their 60s and in average health), and scared of regretting not doing everything he can to facilitate their relationship. Which when I'm less pissed, I get, really, I do. But does that really mean that we have to bend to their wishes for the one big milestone that actually means something to me as a SAHM and will actively leave my involved parents out in the cold? They wouldn't be able to make the trip; his parents are choosing not to and trying to wrest control in order to make some kind of point. Or it's out of selfishness and just doing what they want, damn the fact that she has a mother who feels strongly about celebrating at home and including *everyone*.\n\nUgh, this is a mess but I'm so pissed my husband doesn't have my back. There are some cultural differences here that make my MIL think that she is entitled to this, but it doesn't make it less frustrating. I'm even willing to go visit them a different time in the summer, but they said they already expect that but that it's not a first birthday celebration unless it's the actual day. \n\nMy instinct is \"well then too bad so sad for you!\" But my husband says I'm being heartless to two people who have only see their granddaughter in person twice and that my parents see her every day. But that's exactly MY point - I want to celebrate where she's been raised.\n\nUgh.\n\nETA: also since people might be like \"aw, they can't afford to come, that's sad and it's hard to accept money from your grown kid, you should have more sympathy for that,\" they claim that they can't afford it but then plan trips to fly to Paris and Geneva on two separate trips to visit other extended family members. We still offer to pay even knowing that purchasing international plane tickets are in their budget. It's their money, their choice, but they also don't get to cry poverty and pride...they've made their choice as far as priorities are concerned.",

That used to be funny. It\u2019s not anymore. I owe her big time for that one.\n\nI think back to this bitchy little girl named Timarie who made my life a living hell in kindergarten. KINDERGARTEN! She was a huge bully. It now makes me wonder what kind of terror she was at home, and even greater, makes me wonder why she turned out that way so I can prevent my daughter from becoming that awful of a human being. \n\nI also remember the night my parents picked me up from a sleepover because I got homesick - they were probably thinking, \u201cSCORE! Quiet night!\u201d only to have to pick me up at midnight in robe and slippers.  I appreciate it a thousand times more now!\n\nWhat moments from your childhood stand out for you now that you\u2019re a parent? \n\n\n",

Or not, I'm looking forward to a night where LO is with grandma and I'm having a margarita poolside (I live in WI so I can handle a Florida \"winter\").\n\nETA: please don't just downvote me if you disagree, share your opinion. \nThanks for the help, ordered a Minnie Mouse backpack. It's there if we need it and I would never drag my daughter around. The dream would be to have her content/napping in her stroller the whole time but kids are kids. ",

He rarely gets fussy or inconsolable.  \n  \nLast night, he was a little uncharacteristically fussy, but I knew he just wanted to nurse (he\u2019d been nursing nonstop most of the night). Here\u2019s where my mess up comes in.  \n  \nI, the world\u2019s worst neighbor, had the AUDACITY to get ready for bed. I went pee! Then I even *brushed my teeth*. And changed into pajamas! I mean, really, wtf.  \n  \nThe whole process took about three minutes and, because I\u2019m terribly selfish and need hands to do these things, I have the baby to my partner who tried to comfort him all the while.  \n  \nNow look, I get it. Babies are annoying and no one wants to hear them cry. But seriously, three minutes of crying and that\u2019s what sets you off? Our shared wall isn\u2019t even that thin. Occasionally you can hear a noise from the other side like a cough, but it\u2019s not paper-thin.  \n  \n  \nSo yeah. Please share in my rage and help me plot petty revenge that I\u2019ll never actually act out. ",

I'm sorry you felt you had to delete your post. I'm sorry that users here ignored the auto warning in favor of expressing their personal opinions in a way that ensured your post would be downvoted enough to not be seen. Hey guys? She can't put the foreskin back on her baby. She was asking for help related to a procedure that is still very common and for which many parents have relevant advice. Your personal opinion on whether or not it was an appropriate thing to do isn't really relevant. I'm not trying to stir up a controversial argument here, I'm just really disappointed by the behavior I've seen more and more of around here lately. We're a support subreddit. If a topic doesn't apply to your particular situation, can't we move on peacefully? I know I'm going to take a little break from BTB.",

I had frequent thoughts of inadequacy. The following few months weren\u2019t great. She slept more, but she cried all the time. I held her for every nap. In her every waking moment I had to bounce her and carry her around walking in circles. I felt so bad for her that she just hated life that much. I turned to this sub for reassurance that someday I might feel human again. And I can say that at nearly 5 months old my girl has done a complete 180. She is an absolute delight. She smiles and giggles and naps by herself. She hardly cries. She sleeps 9 hours straight at night. In those early weeks it was easy to get lost in a spiral of hopelessness. I just hope this helps some poor mama out there feel like she can tough it out a little longer. There is a little person just waiting to blossom in that icky little potato blob.

            "selftext": "Throwaway account because I got so much hate on here. English is not my first language and I\u2019m sorry if my wording is not the best. Now I just want to share my experience in case something similar happened to other users.\n\nI posted a question yesterday evening about my 9 months baby who started peeing when I change him. I was curious to see if it was a common thing at this age. I was never angry at him, just surprised, because he had stopped doing this very early (at maybe 3 months?) and I genuinely thought he had understood by himself that diaper changes were not the right time to urinate. Obviously, I was wrong! :)\n\nSo yesterday in my post I was basically wondering two things : 1) Is it common for a 9 mo do to this? 2) What\u2019s the most efficient strategy, to act as if nothing happens when he pees on the changing table, or to gently say \u201cno\u201d so he *maybe*, *eventually* understands it\u2019s not ok?\n\nI\u2019m a FTM so raising a child is new for me. I learn new things every day, I enjoy it, and like a lot of wonderful people here, my baby is loved, happy and raised in a caring and stable environment. Of course sometimes there are downsides and annoying situations to deal with, but I would never, *never* use agressivity as an educational tool whatsoever.\n\nAgain, my wording is probably not the best (it\u2019s difficult to think in a second language). At the end of my post yesterday, I made the mistake to use the word \u201cdiscipline\u201d, saying that I had the feeling \u201cdiscipline and diaper changing\u201d were a tricky issue, so that\u2019s why I needed some advice. By \u201cdiscipline\u201d I meant \u201csaying no\u201d. That\u2019s all. I didn\u2019t know it had such a bad connotation in English.\n\nAfter 45 minutes, my post was so downvoted it was listed as \u201ccontroversial\u201d, one user was starting her response with \u201cWTF \u2013 You NEVER discipline a baby of that age\u201d and I had two hateful PM, one saying \u201cAre you raising a child or training a puppy, you sick fuck?\u201d. \n\nI started to panic, deleted everything and felt like the worse mother just for trying to seek advice. I was feeling so guilty I was crying. I know, it\u2019s just how things work on the Internet, but COME ON, this community is filled with learning, sleep-deprived new parents who are only trying to raise their baby the best they can. How can other parents be so mean and openly judgmental towards a mother who is only asking a question about her 9 months son? \n\nAlso, at what point did it become bad parenting to wonder if a baby\u2019s new behaviour (peeing during diaper change) is normal or possible to change? I mean, we read everywhere that it\u2019s never too early to encourage good sleeping habits, or that the earliest your baby tries different types of solid, the best it is for the future. Why am I a \u201csick fuck\u201d for wondering if the same logic applies for some small diaper changing issues? I know my baby is young, I know he doesn\u2019t understand yet. But can\u2019t we just talk about these things without insulting each others?\n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t even know at this point why I\u2019m typing this. Maybe I feel the need to explain I\u2019m not a \u201csick fuck\u201d. It was my first post after 9 months of lurking, and it was my last. This community is too toxic for me. Thank you for reading, sorry for the negative feelings.\n",

            "selftext": "I've been at my wits end with my husband for quite some time now. We \"talk\" about what needs to change all the time. He shuts down, or he'll do good for a few days and then go back to how it was. I'm tired of feeling like a single, stay at home mom even though I work full time and supposedly have a husband. \n\nToday has just been shit. This morning we got to sleep in because my almost 10 month old son decided not to get up until 9am. God bless. I asked DH to take out the garbage (this was the 5th time I asked in the last two days, but who is counting right) and he kind of groaned. I said \"well these are the responsibilities we have as adults and some things need to be done before we play games\". We had a slow morning and enjoyed breakfast together as a family. DS made a mess per usual and I decided to give him a bath. I have this bad habit of saying things like \"we need to clean up all this food everywhere\" instead of explicitly telling my husband that I expect him to do it. My bad. I guess I just thought that it should be obvious; I'm going to give DS a bath, so he should clean up breakfast. I come from the bathroom with a wet, squirmy child and see not a single thing had been cleaned up and my husband was on his PC playing video games.\n\nNow let me back track a bit. My husband has a few friends that he plays video games with but because they are young shit heads who live at home with no job or responsibilities they sleep all day and play all night. My husband used to stay up for hours on end playing with them while I would go to bed around 9pm or 10pm. We had a talk because it's important for me to both of us to go to bed at the same time. So there was a compromise; I would stay up later and he would go to bed earlier. We agreed on 11pm. \n\nLast night, since today was our day off, I said it would be okay if we stayed up later so he could have more time to play games with his friends. I'm regretting this in every way today. We went to bed at 1am and I did not complain even once about how tired I was. The fact that he got on the PC immediately after I left the room was appalling to me. So I go up and put the baby in his crib for a nap. \n\nI come down and start cleaning. I also had to take the dog out because it was 11am and he hadn't been out yet even though that's my husband's task. I'm angry. I've been struggling with a lot of anger and resentment and kept going over in my head how I wanted to address how upset I was with DH. I decided, though, that if DH said anything to me that I would need to tell him I couldn't talk about it right now because I'm trying to control my anger. During our last big fight my husband said he didn't want me to blow up at him anymore so I've been really trying to do better. I cleaned up the living room and a few other things in the kitchen which did help me cool down. \n\nI had a doctor's appointment this afternoon that I told him not to come to. I just wanted some alone time. When I got home from the appointment I went to bring our laundry downstairs. I don't know what happened but I rolled my ankle on the bottom step. I couldn't walk on it. I screamed out for help and he did come running. We get upstairs and he helps me onto the couch. I have him get me an ice pack and after he immediately went back to his games. I'm sitting on the couch crying in pain while he finishes his game. I was so upset. \n\nHe came to sit with me for a little bit and just kept saying \"there's nothing we can do about it, you're fine\". I told him I'm not fine. He got me some pain meds and continued to sit with me while on his phone. I told him that DS's laundry needed to be turned over into the dryer since it had been sitting in the washer for a bit. He didn't go do it. I had to ask him 3 times before he finally did it. I asked him if he thought I wasn't actually hurt. He said he believed me. Still doesn't seem like it. \n\nAlso during this time our son woke from his nap, DH brought him down for a bottle and then an hour later wanted to go put him back upstairs in his crib. I'm like uh?? He just woke from a nap and he's not tired, he wants to play, he's not going to sleep all day and then sleep all night. \n\nDH made himself lunch and then got back on his games. He didn't even ask me if I wanted anything. I got up and made myself cereal. I had to ask him to get off his game for a second to put the baby down for a nap. Every time I talk to my husband he sounds mopey and unhappy. I feel like a fucking burden you guys. I'm legitimately hurt and I feel like a burden because I need help and am having troubles walking. I tried to lighten the mood and crack some jokes but he didn't laugh at anything. He didn't even smile at something funny I showed up, he just said \"that's hilarious\" with a straight ass face. To me it just feels like he wants me and our son to stay out of his way. It hurts my feelings that he prioritizes video games like this. I've told him how I feel. Nothing is changing. I feel so alone. I don't know what else to do. I have so much anger and resentment that he wants me to control but it's so hard when he doesn't make an effort to do things on his own or take any responsibility. \n\nI know I haven't exactly been a peach to live with. My attitude is shit, I'm angry all the time, I cry all the time. I'm very pregnant and always in pain. I hate myself, truly. But I AM trying to be better. He doesn't notice at all or it's not good enough, I don't know. I just feel like a giant waste of space.",

Ultimately, I'm not going to go against what my husband is comfortable with, but I know this will hurt my sister.

            "selftext": "TLDR: I suck at being super wife and super mom at the same time and my husband is falling out of love with me. \n\nThis is a throwaway. My husband and I have been together 12 years and married for 10. We have a 16 mo old girl. He told me last night he's falling out of love with me. We are just a mom and dad. We have sex quite often, not often enough for him and he says I just treat it like a job and I'm not into it. I don't like to do the same things in bed as he does. I\u2019m not adventurous enough. He says I don't appreciate his hobby of playing his guitar enough. We do not have much time to ourselves and we do not kiss much or touch each other often. I am so focused on my daughter I must admit I just didn't see this coming. I know we haven't been very touchy feely lately but I just figured as our daughter grows we'd have more time for us. I guess he can't wait. I asked him if there was someone else and he said no. I asked him what he wanted to do and he couldn't give me a clear answer. He asked me and I told him that I love him 100% and that I wanted to work on it and be happy together. He said that now if I kiss him or whatever he's going to think that I'm doing it because I feel I have to. He says if I wanted to kiss him I should have been doing it. He isn't sure I can change. The thing I tried to explain is that I've been naive and sort of on auto pilot and I tried to apologize. My daughter wears me out and when she does go to bed I like to enjoy a little ME time before I crash into bed. He gets ME time \u2013 he gets 3-4 days a week off work without wife and kid to do whatever he wants. I don\u2019t get that. He cried, I cried. He said his heart was broken and he can't believe that I didn't feel this coming as he's felt this way for months. The last time he felt love while having sex was several months ago. It's not been that long for me, and that hurt. Truth is I haven't been this hurt in 13 years since I split with my fiance for cheating on me. He says I'm a great mom. I guess I just suck at being a super mom and super wife at the same time. I have to figure out how to balance the two. We don't have many sitter options, we live in a very rural place and family isn't close. I'm hurt, I'm scared, I'm still trying to figure out what happened and how I missed all the signs. I had to vent somewhere. I need some advice. Are we supposed to make meaningful passionate love every single night (because that's what he wants)? Is that normal? I guess I was kind of in the \"ole married couple\" routine. It\u2019s very painful when someone you love very much \u2013 as much as you ever did, tell you they don\u2019t love you as much anymore. And they don\u2019t have much faith in you to do better. His shortcomings (yes, he admitted he has them) do not make me love him any less but my shortcomings make him love me less. I\u2019m in pain and hoping we can continue the conversation tonight. \n",

            "selftext": "My husband's aunt came to Thanksgiving dinner with an active shingles outbreak ON HER FACE. But *she* didn't think it was shingles. (Read: didn't want to miss out on facebook likes with her great nephew. She posts pics my MIL forwards her of him constantly even though she never talks to me and sees my son once a year at most. That's a rant for another day) so she saw 4 (four!!) doctors until one finally agreed it was just some infected hairs and she shouldn't be contagious. I told my MIL that I didn't want her there because my baby wasn't going to be vaccinated until December 8th (THIS FREAKING FRIDAY. UUUGH) and my husband had SERIOUS COMPLICATIONS with chicken pox that needed SURGERY to correct. \n\nMy husband is my MILs son. MIL KNEW HOW SERIOUS THIS WAS. She was there. She went through that with her son. She knew how I felt. I am not usually a germaphobe but I make a huge exception for chicken pox. But no. Faaaaaamilllllllyyyyyyy is too important. Aunt only sees my baby once a yeeeeaaaar. I can't deprive Aunt from seeing her faaaaaamillllllyyyyyy. So I compromised. I've had shingles before. I know it's only contagious through direct physical contact with the rash and I decided I was okay with Aunt being around as long as she kept her distance. Everyone agreed. \n\nAunt sat on the far side of the table and dinner went fine even though I was on my guard. But then she got ready to leave and I happened to be sitting with baby right near the door. She stopped to say goodbye and leaned in really close. I pulled my baby closer to me since she was making me uncomfortable and right as I was about to say something she leaned in and kissed my baby RIGHT ON THE MOUTH. Then she ran out the door gleefully to escape my anger like my child's health was a game. She didn't *forget*. She knew exactly that she had crossed my boundary and endangered my child. If my eyes could shoot lasers she would have been a pile of ash. I wish I had shoved her away when she leaned in. No one else saw what she did so I didn't bother saying anything after she left.\n\nBut now it's a week later and my poor baby, who is right in the middle of having all four first year molars cut, is covered in pox and is absolutely miserable. Guys, he has pox spots on his ears, between his toes and even in his little mouth. He isn't sleeping unless I hold him in the rocking chair. I have barely slept in days. I wish I could force my husband's selfish, entitled, uncaring Aunt to sit here awake all night and listen to my poor rash covered baby cry.",

She had no heartbeat when born and was completely lifeless. After what felt like an eternity of chest compressions, the NICU team was able to get a faint heartbeat on her, and then she was transported a few hours later to the wonderful children's hospital in our area, where she was placed on a cooling mat and in a cooling hat for 72 hours. Yesterday afternoon they began the re-warming process, and we should have an idea sometime today via an MRI of how extensive the damage is. Basically, she has a 30% chance of dying, a 40% chance of having severe brian/motor damage, and a 30% chance of mild/no impairment. Obviously her amazing father and I are terrified, and there is nothing we can do but wait. If you're so inclined, we would so appreciate your prayers and good thoughts. ",

            "selftext": "Would you choose it again, or would you try other pain management techniques next time? I'm being advised by my doctors to consider having an epidural, and even an early epidural not long into labour, because I'm epileptic and I should take advantage of pain management to minimise seizure triggers like stress and tiredness. \n\nI'm sure they know what they're talking about, it just feels disappointing somehow. It's not what I would choose in a perfect world. I get that lots of things in labour won't be, but I think it would seem different to adapt to the realities of labour as they unfold, rather than having 'plan for early epidural' written on my notes weeks in advance.  \n\nI'm not allowed pethidine as that's a seizure trigger, my hospital doesn't do fentanyl, I'm probably not allowed a water birth for the same reason I'm not supposed to take baths in case of seizures, so that only leaves me with gas and air / Tens machine as other pain management options. I wish there was a half way house between the very low key pain relief options and an epidural, but there doesn't seem to be. In an ideal world I'd do it all through breathing and gas and air, but I know perfectly well I'll probably want something stronger..I just don't want something as strong as an epidural. \n\nI want to feel contractions a bit, I want to be able to move around and not forced to lie on my back, I want to be able to feel when I need to push, and I don't want the increased risks of intervention etc that come with an epidural. But I also don't want to ignore doctors advice. It's still ultimately my choice though. \n\nWhat are the good sides to having an epidural, or are there other pain management options I haven't thought of?\n\nEdited to add: thanks for the replies everyone, definitively made me feel better to hear about the potential positives of choosing an epidural :)",

That\u2019s the routine, he does the bath and gets her all dressed and ready for bed. I do her nighttime bottle and have a little cuddle and down she goes. \n\nShe sleeps from about 7pm to 3/4am most nights. She woke at her usual time. I went into the nursery and picked her up and she was soaking wet. I immediately thought omg she must be way too hot, she is sweating. As I put her on the change table I thought, oh maybe she peed through her diaper. Well when I opened up her pjs to change her..... ummmm where is her diaper?!?! No wonder there was pee everywhere. \n\nI woke my husband up to come and help me change her so I could change the crib sheet. \n\nHe asked me if I was sure there was no diaper.... and then tells me he was too worried about his MEATBALL SUB getting cold that he must have forgot. \n\nNeedless to say it obviously didn\u2019t bother my baby since she didn\u2019t wake up earlier than usual and I am now sitting rocking her and having a good chuckle to myself at my husbands expense! :) \n\nAnyone else have a funny husband fail story?!

What bothers me is that if she is targeting all pregnant women and mothers, she is potentially causing them to be waaay more insecure. And she knows this! Why else would she pit hubby against me?

            "selftext": "I sometimes want to take a bath or shower, but my baby son (almost 6mo) has some separation anxiety issues, so I usually postpone it until husband gets home. But sometimes I *really* just want to shower and it feels like it would be so easy to just put the kid on the floor of the shower in his baby bathtub and take a quick shower. I mean, I get dressed in front of him, so what's the difference??\n\nMy husband thinks it's gross and weird to shower with him. A quote from the discussion was \"he'll be looking up at your soapy vagina and that's weird\" but, I mean, the kid literally came out of there anyways so...he's seen it before lol. \n\nAm I a butthead for being annoyed at this? I mean sure he's a baby *boy*, and in the FUTURE I would never shower with him, but he sucks from my tit and that's not weird, but being with me in the shower is weird? I don't know. \n\nHe's said before that he'd be worried I'd \"scar\" him or he'd develop weird fetishes later in life because of it. He's not going to remember this, probably, FIRST OF ALL. Secondly, I bathed with my *brother* until I was like nine??? And I don't have incest fetishes or anything!! Like...what?\n\nThis is kinda rambled because I feel like this is goofy and getting my thoughts together is hard. I'm currently sitting on the bed next to my son waiting on my husband to get home from Walmart so I can take a shower before we go out to eat -_-\n\nEdit: well wow! thanks for all the support, guys!! &lt;3",

            "selftext": "I just need to vent a bit, because today has sucked, and the worst part was getting mom-shamed in the grocery store.\n\nThis afternoon I took my LO to the store to get a few things for her.  Everything is fine until we're in line to check out, and this middle-aged lady gets in line behind us.  She's nice at first - smiling and saying hi to LO, but not trying to touch or do anything that would upset her, so I let the lady enjoy talking as LO stares at her.\n\nLady is talking, and I start putting our groceries up on the belt.  All of a sudden it's like a switch flipped in this lady's brain, because she sees that I'm buying a big box of goldfish and she starts berating me for feeding them to LO.  Let me be clear here - yes, I'm buying a giant box of goldfish crackers, and yes, LO is going to eat some of them.   Most of what she eats is very healthy, but sometimes she gets a little treat.\n\nAnyways, this lady is bashing me for getting the goldfish, and she's even bashing me because of the amount of money I'm spending on them (they weren't expensive at all).  I about lost it, but opted to just ignore her because I want to be setting a good example for LO, so I'll just share my list of why this lady can shove it with you guys instead:\n\n1.  LO is not your daughter, she's mine.  My husband and I have chosen to allow her to have whole whole grain goldfish as a snack on occasion.  That's a choice we've made and we're happy with it.\n\n2.  If you hadn't been so busy berating me for the goldfish, maybe you would have noticed the rest of the food in my cart - whole wheat bread, eggs, and fresh fruit.  Most of that is for LO, because she eats pretty healthy most of the time.\n\n3.  Why do you even care how much I'm spending on a box of goldfish?  I'm paying with my own money - not yours.  Even if I was on welfare, it'd be none of your business.\n\nThe whole situation was just so frustrating.  My daughter has really been turning into a toddler lately, and I'm still trying to adjust to that.  I always worry about whether or not I'm a good enough mom, and the last thing I need is some random lady trying to make me feel bad for my choices.\n\nAnyone else been mom-shamed lately?  How do you deal with it?\n\nEdit to add that she was buying natty lite and cigarettes, so definitely didn't have any room to judge me on the healthiness of my groceries.",

            "selftext": "So I just came across this article. It's about a mom who is suing the hospital for the death of her son, who was put in her arms to breastfeed but died after being smothered by the mom (who was on a mix of painkillers and sleep aids, recovering from a c-section).\n\n[Link](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2017/08/11/a-sleeping-mother-suffocated-her-newborn-in-the-maternity-ward-now-shes-suing-the-hospital/?utm_term=.4d2b6cff35c5)\n\nThis same exact thing could have happened to me... or so many other mothers. When I was recovering after the birth of my second child, I was all alone in the room 80% of the time (my husband had to take care of our toddler son). After being awake for 24 hours straight after birth, I was so exhausted that I actually asked the nurse if there was a nursery they could take my baby to -- I told her that I kept falling asleep with my baby in my arms. She said no, we can't take baby to the nursery, he had to stay with me. And she just left me with my baby, exhausted. I would put him in the bassinet but he would cry and the  I would lift him out again, and just let him sleep on my chest -- while I struggled, and failed, not to doze off. \n\nLuckily nothing happened... but seriously,  the worst could have. :( Recovering from a c-section would be even more dangerous because sometimes the mother can't even physically lift the baby to put him/her in the bassinet -- they sometimes need a nurse to do it. And the nurses are not often immediately available. And like the mom in the article, you are not only sleep deprived, but can be on so many drugs after birth -- I am actually sort of surprised incidents like this haven't happened more. \n\nThe article has made me question how \"baby-friendly\" it really is to leave newborns with mothers recovering from birth, and oftentimes also recovering from major surgery and on lots of meds. \n\nI think traditionally, and in the ideal situation, we would be surrounded by family helping to take care of new mothers and babies, especially if the birth was hard. Grandma, aunts, sister or even husband, brother, uncles or children would be present to take the baby if need be, and mom/baby would generally not be left alone for long periods. My husband said that in india, mothers are never left alone. Family is always there. However, in the US, this traditional arrangement is not normal or often feasible anymore. Should it be easier for moms to leave newborns in a nursery if need be? What are your thoughts?",

I bought into all the hype and never got my son vaccinated, and since we got pregnant with #2 we reevaluated and decided that was not a good idea (no judgment from me if this is your choice!  We just didn't feel right about it)\n\n#2 has since been born. We have her 2 month checkup today and my sons 2-year. And we are getting them their shots. \n\nI am so scared. .\n\nWhat if something goes wrong?  \n\nI hate seeing them in pain. I felt physically ill when my daughter SCREAMED when she got the HepB. Both of my babies are going to be in pain and I am letting it happen. I KNOW this is for their own good. I am not wavering in my choice to vaccinate them.\n\nBut I have a metallic taste in my mouth from the anxiety and worry. \n\nI guess I just wanted to say this here....there is so little judgment here and I feel comfortable telling you all this. I just..  I feel bad, I guess.\n\nSon gets ice cream today. Daughter is too little but I have plenty of snuggles for her.",

My husband told him that calling our child \"sexy\" is wildly inappropriate and downright creepy and that the comments he made while changing her diaper were completely disgusting and out of line. My husband went on to say how he is not to be alone with our daughter and he is NEVER allowed to change her diaper. At first, FIL was irate but then calmed down and apologized. I decided that I would still visit once in a while but I would be there along with husband and if he couldn't be there it would be me, FIL and MIL. \n\nWell, on our visit today \"grandpa\" decided he would change our daughters diaper and was bold enough to not say anything and take it upon himself while I was preparing my daughter a bottle. When I turned around and saw him changing her by her pack and play I was livid. I rushed over, took over and then gave him the riot act. He was sitting down and I approached him in a very calm manner and said \"FIL, you were told that you are not allowed to change her diaper...\" and before I could even get the last words out he was irate. His face was purple, veins popping out and he began to tell me \"you know what? You and my son have a lot of nerve accusing me. I called her sexy, so what?! There is nothing wrong with that!\" To which I responded and said \"calling any child sexy is extremely inappropriate and unsettling and yes, you are wrong. I don't care if you think it's okay, it's not. We don't want our daughter connotating herself with the word sexy, not now and not when she is old enough to comprehend. I want her to think of herself as strong, capable, smart, funny and a million other things but sexy is not one of them\" he turns to me and says \"you and my son have screws lose because there is nothing wrong with it. I will ask a psychologist about it\" to which I quipped back \"I have already asked a psychologist and they said it is NEVER the correct word to use when describing or speaking to a child, NOT NORMAL\" I grabbed my stuff to leave and he keeps going on as I am getting ready to go \"you have issues\" \"I am not weird\" then he turns to me and goes \"I am her grandfather\" and I said back \"I am her mother, you do not make any executive decisions regarding my daughter\" he turns and says \"you are a very dangerous person to be around making accusations. I am allowed to change so and so's diaper\" I was shaking from anger and sadness at this point and he turns to me and says \"you know what get the fuck out of my house, I'm done with this. I am calling your father to see if you treat him like a jerk off like you treat me\" I warned him not to involve anyone especially my father. So I leave and as I'm leaving he is peering into my daughters car seat saying \"your parents are crazy and hopefully you won't disrespect them like they have me\" I decided to go to my sisters and my dad was there and guess who he is on the phone with? My lovely FIL tells my dad that I am disrespectful to accuse him and is asking my dad if he thought it was wrong to call my daughter sexy. He also continued to tell my father that I told him my dad used to beat me and that I accused my father of hitting my nephew (which I never did). He called with the intent of starting a drama within my family. The kicker of it all is that MIL confided in a friend ( a mother of 4 daughters) and the friend said she sees nothing wrong with using the word sexy. She even said that her step father called her daughters sexy and it's just the \"old way\" bullshit. My therapist said that it is not the old way and that my FIL has severe issues that need psychiatric intervention. I am so infuriated by this whole situation. I called my husband at work and he is fuming beyond belief. This is the end. He is no longer allowed to contact us. I left some of my daughters things in the heat of the moment and need them back. I don't know what to do. I tried to play nice but this was absolutely the final straw. ",

            "selftext": "Im sorry but this one is long\n\nMy son is 3 weeks old (4 weeks on this next Tuesday). And I know, I get it \"It gets better\" bullshit, but I just want to leave him with his dad already and never come back. \n\nI never wanted kids. I don't like them. I had depression that was undiagnosed through high school and I think I have a general anxiety disorder because I'm always anxious. My life felt great for once. I got engaged last fall and was excited to start planning. Then I found out I was pregnant after being told I couldn't get pregnant. My fianc\u00e9, while knowing I didn't want kids, seemed to be in that \"I-just-want-to-be-with-you\" mentality and couldn't care either way. I know now that was incorrect and that he loved the idea of being a dad, having helped raise his 5 nieces and nephews. \n\nNow suddenly I was stressed because I couldn't afford a wedding and a baby. I thought about abortion, but I couldn't do it for some reason. My fianc\u00e9 was happy, and I wanted to be happy, but I was miserable. I was sick all day everyday for 6 months. It affected my new job. I was on the verge of being fired for months, and finally was when I was 8 months. I cried all of the time because I was either nauseous, in pain or unable to sleep because everything was so uncomfortable. I don't think I have slept through a night since I was 5 months. \n\nThen we couldn't afford to live on our own. Now we live with his sister and her 2 kids. The three of us are in a tiny ass room (only 2 feet of walking space as we have all of the baby stuff plus a fraction of our own). I live nowhere near my family, and I have no friends. \n\nThe first week after baby arrived, I was exhausted and I cried nonstop. He wouldn't latch, and I hated pumping so I gave up on breastmilk of any variety after 2 weeks. In that time he wasn't gaining weight and the doctor kept telling me how often and how much to feed. So I did that and he would lose more. Than she looked at me like I was an idiot because I can't recognize hunger cues and I had no idea what I was doing. My son would rather sleep than eat, and she explained that I have to feed him every 2 hours night and day. My fianc\u00e9 took off an extra week to \"help\" which was more like only do something when I asked him to. I felt like a doctor, on call 24/7 for the neediest patient in the world. \n\nI began to resent my son and I probably began resenting him before he was born. I couldn't eat what I wanted, I couldn't drink what I wanted. I used to spend my night with my fianc\u00e9 playing video games and smoking hookah, and I loved it. That was gone and it will be for a long time because now I have this screeching asshole of a child crying at me. I literally go sometimes 4-7 hours without eating because every time I put him down to sleep and put a fork to my mouth, he wakes up crying. If I need to pee, he's crying. I go 4 days with no shower because I can't put him down. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 went back to work this week and it's been fucking hell. As soon as he leaves the baby is no longer an angel. He stays awake too long and then is too tired to nap. Then it seems like at least once a night he will cry endlessly. Yesterday around 6 PM he wouldn't stop. I couldn't take it anymore. I left him in his bassinet for 20-30 minutes just crying so I could gather myself. I washed bottles and went pee. Came back and he was still wailing. He was fed, changed, and wasn't running a fever. I couldn't stop crying so I started yelling and pleading for him to please just shut the hell up. I picked him up and cried while I rocked him. After an hour he stopped. But then he'd start again if I put him down. So.o spent 4 hours rocking him and crying because I just wanted to sleep, and eat, and he wouldn't leave me alone. \n\nToday he was fussy but manageable. Then my fianc\u00e9 and the rest of the household left and he started again. I put on Harry Potter and tried to rock him while I did something I liked. But he just kept crying. I figured the new formula was the culprit and he had gas because he'd get really stuff legs and as soon as he let out a cry he would pass gas. I gave him a gas drop. Eventually he fell asleep at 9PM. He woke up at 12AM when his dad came home. He took him and let me sleeo, which he rarely does. I slept until 3 when he woke up with a vengeance. Nothing I did consoled him, and after 15 minutes I couldn't take it anymore. I set him down in his bassinet as his dad picked him up and asked where I was going. I closed the door behind me and just sat in the dark living room crying. I wondered if I could just leave and give up my rights to my son. I wanted to go home, to my family. I was angry because I do everything all day for this baby and he only stopped crying when dad held him. Every time he cries, dad soothes him. I can't even calm my own baby. It's like he hates me. \n\nI am running on no sleep which makes everything worse. I can't sleep even if he is, though, because I keep panicking wondering what if he stops breathing and I don't notice because I had the normal human audacity to fall asleep? What if I didn't burp him good enough last feeding and he spits up and can't breathe? What if he's sick and has a temperature but I don't pick up on it and think to check it? I feel horrible for having brought him into this world with such a mother as myself. I wish I could go back and never have had him. \n\nI'm 100% certain it's PPD and PPA, but I'm so ashamed. Everyone in my family and his are awesome parents, no history of a perinatal disorder at all. They all tell me how much they love him, and I don't get it; I created him, birthed him, and am with him every minutes of every day, why don't *I* love him? I want him to be safe, but I don't love him. I'm worried even if it's PPD and they treat it, that what will still be left is my feeling that I don't want to be a mom. I can't medicate that.",

It's social media that allows you to interact with your neighbors and your address must be verified in order to be a member, so it is relatively private in that respect. Yesterday our community had a fireworks show scheduled for 9:15 PM. My husband and I were so excited to bring my daughter to see her first fireworks! She had a blast running around and trying food truck fare. Unfortunately, we had to leave before the fireworks show because it was delayed almost an hour and my baby was nodding off (as soon as we got in our front door it started!) This morning as I was checking nextdoor.com, I saw the message about the fireworks being delayed and I left a comment that we were sad and disappointed that we missed the show due to the delay. I specifically mentioned that we had to leave after waiting because my 17-month old couldn't stay awake any longer. So here's where the drama begins...\n\nI get a private message from a woman. She says \"A 17 month old has very delicate ears.     U should never subject a baby to this loud noise!   Per physicians and common sense.\"\n\nUmm... what the hell? After stewing over this for a couple of minutes, I messaged her back the following \"Please leave your sanctimonious comments to yourself and don't message me again.\" I figured that was that and I wouldn't hear from her again. \n\nNope.\n\nShe messaged me back shortly after with this: \"Maybe google \"baby safety\". Thanks.  Poor baby\"\n\nI just. I can't even with this old biddy (I looked her up on facebook to see if I recognize her, but I don't) so instead of responding I just reported her for violating community guidelines. The nerve of this woman!\n\nSigh. I knew my day was coming! \n\nYou have any stories to commiserate with me?",

I am constantly (and I mean, CONSTANTLY) reading up on what's best for my baby's development and to have somebody tell me it's wrong because it doesn't line up with what she did over 20 years ago, just doesn't make sense to me. Not even mentioning, all baby experiences are different. I EBF, I put baby to sleep on his back with no added accessories in his crib, I decided against a walker and the list continues on what I'm being told isn't the \"right\" way. Just cause I was born after the year 1980.....doesn't make me a idiot for not rubbing alcohol on my child's gums for teething!! So this is for us Millennial mothers who strive to be the best mom's we can be.....with our own mothering style! \n\n\nEdit: some people are saying that this is not just a millennial thing and all mom's experience this.

            "selftext": "My 16 week old daughter has beautiful, light blue eyes. I love putting her in grey and blue outfits because they really make those peepers POP! But I am learning that even the 'girliest' blues and greys are somehow not 'acceptable'...\n\nWhen she was seven weeks old we took her to the emergency room (it turned out to be nothing serious). She was wearing a grey onesie with \"Daddy's MVP\" written in pink. The nurse said \"what seems to be the trouble with your son?\" I politely corrected her...and that should have been the end of it. A little while later the same nurse walked by with another nurse and said \"what a sweet little boy\". I corrected her again and she said to the other nurse...\"well she LOOKS like a boy or is that just me?\"\n\nI let it go because it was quarter passed midnight and they were likely just as tired as me.\n\nWhen she was about 9 weeks I took her out in public wearing a blue onesie with little raccoons on it. Believe me, it still looked 'girly'. I was accosted by an old lady who accused me of trying to make my daughter a lesbian.\n\nI let this go because I'm not going to let an ignorant, mean old biddy ruin my day.\n\nWhen she was 11 weeks old I dressed her in a pale blue, lacy cardigan, a white onesie with pale purple polka dots, and grey leggings for a trip to the mall with my father-in-law. I had a salesperson tell me my 'son' needs more masculine clothes. I had someone stop me in the food court and commend me for being a part of the gender neutral baby movement. When I was trying on clothes my father in law held my daughter and fed her a bottle (a bright pink bottle I may add). He had one person ask why his granddaughter was dressed so butch. He had another comment on the 'mod' bottle his 'grandson' was using.\n\nI had a REALLY hard time letting this go. People need to mind their own damn business!\n\nToday I dressed her in a white onesie with little pale blue stars all over it, white frilly leggings, and a grey cardigan with large white daisies on it. On our daily walk a passerby muttered loud enough for me to hear \"damn millennial raising their kids to be gay\".\n\nOK...for one thing I am 28, so I'm not sure if that even makes me a millennial...but more importantly clothing has NOTHING to do with the sexuality of my BABY! Another thing, if my daughter does turn out to be gay I would love her just as much...and I doubt what she wore as a baby would have had anything to do with her sexual preferences.\n\nBut enough is enough. Excuse me while I go buy a stack of bright pink clothes I can't really afford so people will leave me and my daughter alone &gt;:-(\n\n",

            "selftext": "(Foreword: I'm just back from holiday. I'll blame the holiday blues for this one.)\n\nI met a new mama in the baby aisle today, at our big local supermarket. \n\nHer baby was screaming. She was so tired, and so anxious, with the scraped up mum bun and odd socks, staring wide eyed around her.\n\nAnd of course, there was a sanctimonious old lady at her side. I rocked up, three out of my four babies in tow, looking for some of Ella's Kitchen's finest to keep the peace,  just in time to hear the delights of her lecture:\n\n\"If you didn't wanted be tired, you should've shut your legs. Now give that baby a bottle and stop that squawking.\"\n\nI looked at her and saw myself, a terrified first time mum being stared at by what seemed like the whole world. I remembered the fear, and the worry, and just wanting to look as though I deserved to have my gorgeous baby, and could actually look after him. And I remember sanctimonious old lady that had cornered me in the supermarket, and told me I was starving my scrawny preemie with my rubbish, tiny boobs. I wailed for days over that.\n\nI'd like to say I was all peace peace love love, but mamas, I saw red. I grabbed this young mama and I marched her down the aisle, whilst shouting over my shoulder at this grizzled old hag. My two toddlers were even silent, as my 3 year old whispered in hushed tones; Mama said a swear word.\n\nHer babe was 3 weeks old. Her husband had just returned to work and she had braved her first trip out of the house solo. Her poor boobs were so sore, but she was too nervous to feed in public because she felt everyone stared. You know what she wanted, why she braved a trip out? All she wanted was a damned donut and to feel like she could mother her baby out in public.\n\nSo I sat with her at the in-store cafe, and we fed our babies together, in public, and my eldest tagalong plaited her hair (sorry mama, the tangles will take hours to get out) and we chatted. I held her now sleeping babe and I sent my 2 year old with her to get a bag of donuts to bite any further spooky witches lurking in the aisles. We moaned about how awful it was to have sore nipples, and that we were both so tired we could nap there and then, and how much we hated doing night time feeds while our partners lay snoring with their useless nipples and milkless manboobs.\n\nI saw this mama laugh. I told her that her baby was beautiful (he was a gorgeous chunky little thing) and that she was amazing. I loaned her my spare woven wrap I had in the car, gave her a quick demo and gave her the sling meet up details. I gave her the breastfeeding support group details. I gave her my number and told her to phone me the next time some old cow decides to assault her in the shopping aisle.\n\nAnd then I got in my car and ranted all the way home to my three babies about how awful some people are and my two year old concluded that we should have farted on that old lady.\n\nBuild each other up, ladies, we all need our tribe. There are too many old sanctimonious hags out there not to.\n\n#Edit: Heck, this blew up overnight! Thank you for all your lovely comments, but I'd like to think I didn't do anything any other mama would have done. The mama in question text me this morning to say thank you again, and to say her LO loved the sling so far. I'm hoping to see her at our sling meet tomorrow if she's feeling up to it!\n\n#And yes, to the people who asked in message - I didn't get the shopping I went for. But that's okay, because there were more important things to deal with. DH's dinner &lt; mama tribe. We had a picnic in the garden instead.",

I had the super expensive pump with all the trimmings and was going to breastfeed until a year and then exclusively pump for as long as possible.\n\nBut Mother Nature had other plans and at a week old, we had to switch. I was so engorged from not being able to achieve letdown that she couldn't latch. I was in pain and not sleeping, a mix of complicated birth and her having Colic. She lost too much weight and Mommy and Daddy needed some sanity.\n\nSo can I just say Fuck You to the old woman at the doctors office who start loudly explaining to her friend how much healthier it is to breastfeed as soon as I pulled the bottle out? She's reaching all her milestones ahead of time and is perfect. Don't you think I have guilt in not being able to nurse her you evil cow? Mind your own damn business.\n\nBaby Girl had a cold. It was scary because I feared she wasn't getting enough nutrients or breathing ok so I called the after hours line and what do you know? The nurse decided to tell me how much better off she would be if I nursed because she probably wouldn't get sick and went over how much better breast milk is. Baby girl is 7 months old. The girls are dry and I was calling to see if we needed to go to the ER, don't give me this bullshit.\n\nI'm just getting sick of the lectures and comments. These are the two most recent (within the last two weeks).\n\nAnyone else getting this and how do you handle it?",

I've heard many times that I'm \"lucky\" to get to have a mixed baby, and when I just smile and nod, I've gotten a few times, \"No, you don't understand, I loooooooove mixed babies!\" One woman I worked with just went on and on about how when she has kids, she really wants to adopt a mixed baby because she finds them so especially beautiful, which I think is an incredibly weird line of thinking. \n\n\nWith me personally, I just find it annoying, but my husband is especially not crazy about it. It'd be one thing if I seldom heard it, but it's often enough that I'm wondering what the hell people are expecting me to say to that. It's not a compliment of my own child, and \"getting to have a mixed baby\" was not a factor in deciding to spend the rest of my life with my husband. \n\n\nAny other parents of mixed kids out there care to weigh in?

We do not have the money or resources to have another baby. I am struggling with severe anxiety and depression. My decision isn't really even a choice at this point. Having another child is just something we cannot do.\n\nI am getting an abortion this week. I am devastated. I want another child so badly, but we simply cannot afford to do it right now. I feel stupid and guilty for not being more careful with my birth control methods. I wish that we never moved to be closer to his family that wants nothing to do with us anymore. I wish that there was ANY other way for this to work. But it can't. And I have no idea how to proceed. I have never been so torn about something I know I'm making the right decision about. Logically I know we're doing the right thing for all of us, but emotionally I am a wreck. Does anyone have any words of wisdom for me?

Like at least four times a week she posts these articles about how weak women are for caving to an epidural, blah blah blah. She is 6 years older than me, she isn't married, isn't dating anyone and talks about how she wants kids so badly. a mutual friend shared an article about how womens pain tends to be ignored by doctors and I commented about how I got an epidural after 12 hours (labor ended up being 24 hours, pushed for 3) because my son was coming out face up (hurt so badly) and she commented again about how she is going to give birth naturally because she cares about the well-being of her unborn child. I basically told her she was being a turd and that no one has to defend their birth choices to anyone. \n\n\nI'm just really annoyed. My MIL gives me crap for getting an epidural (even though she got one) and this person does to and it's really frustrating. Did I want to give birth the  old fashioned way? I thought I might, but the reality of my labor was much different and I don't think I'm a failure because I ended up getting one half way though. \n\n\nAm I just surrounded by shitty people or is this a common thing y'all deal with?

I'm actually mostly poking fun at myself.\n\nI go to an exercise class for moms on Thursdays, and my son is the second oldest. The other babies are 9 months and 2 months old.\n\nThe mom of the 2-month-old is disappointed to be spending the upcoming summer indoors because her baby will be too young for sunscreen unless she can somehow get a special Australian sunscreen that is chemical-free shipped to our small Canadian city. I took my then 4-month-old to The South over spring break. He wore sunscreen.\n\nThe mother of the 9 month old is having a drink for the first time since she became pregnant with her daughter, having just finished breastfeeding. I drink every weekend in moderation.\n\nWait til they find out that I bedshare, give Tylenol, own an exersaucer and let LO watch cartoons while I poop.  \ud83d\ude05\n\nHas anyone else has this experience?\n\nAnyway. No matter how you do it, happy Mother's Day. I know everyone reading this is doing a great job her way.",

            "selftext": "A post triggered me in a major way, and I just want to put this out there for other new moms going through what I did.\n\nDear Lactation Consultant,\n\nI didn't realize it at the time, but you took my mom power away. My daughter was starving, and you told me she was just adjusting to life. \"Her latch is perfect!\", you said, but she was still struggling. She was turning more yellow by the hour and you told me to 'say no\" to formula because she didn't need it, she just needed to get rid of the extra bilirubin.\n\nBut you see, lactation consultant, after a week of struggling, I pumped. I abused my boobs until they were bruised and still only got a quarter of an ounce of breast milk.\n\nMy daughter was HUNGRY and not getting anything of substance from me. She wasn't sleeping, crying all of the time, and sucking my nipples so much it took them a couple of weeks to heal.\n\nI cried during every feeding and the hours of subsequent 'comfort sucking' as you called it. It hurt SO much. I felt in my heart that she was hungry, but I 'knew' that I would eventually start producing milk if I 'tried hard enough'.\n\nBut, my daughter's pediatrician looked at me and said \"I'm concerned she's falling behind. I'm going to have you start supplementing.\" I had, had enough. This formula thing was happening no matter what anyone said.\n\nYou know what happened? My starving daughter got full for the first time. She snuggled into me completely content and fell asleep -- for the first time. One month later, she had gained and grown by leaps and bounds. \n\nBreast isn't best. Breast is an option.\n\nI continued to pump, but somehow my supply just got worse. Now DD is EFF.\n\nLast night after the umpteenth time feeding my little girl that 'evil' formula you were so against, she smiled at me for the first time. The most beautiful thing I have ever seen in my entire life.\n\nI didn't 'give up' or 'wimp out' or 'get lazy'. I made the best choice for my daughter. She was hungry and I fed her. Yes, I wanted the breastfeeding relationship, but instead I got the bottle-fed relationship. As far as I can tell, there really isn't a difference.\n\nI'm still pissed that your 'baby friendly' hospital would allow a delicate newborn to go hungry because of the phrase 'breast is best'.\n\nSo moms. Fed is truly best. Fed grows babies. Fed gets you beautiful first smiles that you will never forget.\n\nStay strong and keep your mom power. Don't let anyone tell you the best way to feed your child.",

            "selftext": "I post here about my kid's terrible sleep, like, a lot. So just a heads up if you aren't interested in reading a sleep complaint again. \n\nMy child doesn't fucking sleep. This has turned me into an ugly person and I hate who I've become. I'm short-tempered, resentful, and bitter. I'm jealous and spiteful. When other moms talk about the things they get to do, I want to scream. When my parents tell me that I just \"need to get her used to napping on-the-go,\" I feel like my head is going to explode. Everyone seems to think that I created this problem somehow; that I'm a slave to my child's sleep and I've given up my life. I'm just a neurotic first time mom. \n\nEveryone pisses me off. Everything pisses me off. I want to send my kid to live somewhere else for like a week so I don't have to fucking look at her. \n\nI'm starting to hate my kid sometimes, too. I simultaneously feel guilty for letting her cry and want to leave her in her crib and run away. I'm so tired. I'm tired of listening to her, tired of following her around so she doesn't kill herself, tired of being stuck in my stupid fucking goddamned house just so I can give my kid the opportunity to sleep (which she'll completely ignore). \n\nI have tried every amount of juju and voodoo. I've read all the sleep books. We do all of the tricks and routines. We did extinction sleep training and we have NEVER deviated from the training. We follow a schedule and pay attention to sleep cues, adjusting as needed based on what she's \"telling\" us. She's 9 months old so what the fuck will she really communicate anyways, but that's a different matter. \n\nNaps are always less than 40 minutes. Occasionally she'll take a random 1.5 hour nap and I have zero clue what causes them. By 5:00 every evening she's so exhausted she's just a crabby asshole, but if she goes to bed at 5 she's up for the day ready to rock and roll at 4am. We can barely keep her awake until 6:30, at which point she passes out almost immediately. She still wakes up between 5 and 6am usually, even though we NEVER go into her room before 6:30am. She doesn't sleep through the night and never has. \n\nI don't need advice on getting my kid to sleep anymore. I've read it all, at least twice, and tried so many things. Babywearing naps! This schedule! That schedule! Ferber! Weissbluth! Precious Little Sleep! More solids! Less solids! Nursing to sleep! Don't nurse to sleep! \n\nIf you've read this, I'm sorry. I just needed to get this out into the void. Maybe if I project all this negativity away from me my kid will sleep better. \n",

I love my time with her, but mama needs some target (yard sale, Home Depot, I take anything) and adult people in her life since hubby works all day and we're new to the area and know no one. Yesterday, some lady out of the blue says 'Oh, she's brand new, what's she doing *here*?!'\n\nSo, apparently I'm supposed to be a hermit until she's 'old enough'? (When is that, exactly?) I mean, I don't let people touch/get close to her, mostly keep her car seat cover over her (unless I'm checking in like I was yesterday), and I use sanitizer before touching her. But, whatever. Bad mom it is.",

This past two weeks have been crazy for me emotionally but I saw the request for an update and wanted to let everyone know what was going on even though it\u2019s been generally uneventful. I got so many messages and comments with support that meant so much to me.\nSo soon after I wrote that post my mom had arrived to help me get through my anxiety and support me. By the time she was here I was in a hotel and still had not slept. It was going way too long without sleeping and I think the deprivation of sleep was making me crazier. She came and sat with me while I slept. It was the most helpful thing anyone could have done for me. \nMy husband asked to talk so I agreed to meet with him. He apologized and said he realized I was right, his mom had severely crossed a line and that it was hard for him to accept his mom did something so wrong so in his head he was telling himself it was not that bad and that if the baby wasn\u2019t hurt then no harm was done but he wasn\u2019t thinking about the hurt done to me and my feeling of security. He said he changed the locks on the home and would support whatever I wanted to do with his mom. He said he was willing to cut off contact for a while but asked I not press charges.  We left it at that for that time. I told him I\u2019d think about what he said and keep in touch. \nShortly after this whole thing happened I got a lot of texts from his family supporting me and letting me know they were so sorry about what happened and that no matter what my baby and I are family and we have their support. That meant so much to me. People were finally backing me up and it gave me some peace of mind.\nA few days after seeing my husband we met up again. He had a letter from his mom. I thought about just throwing it out but I decided to read it. It was a very long winded apology. It basically said that she is sick about what she did. She said if someone did that to her when her husband was young she\u2019d want them to die. She is terrified about losing me as a DIL and her grandchild but she is going to keep her distance. She asked me to reach out if and when I am ready. I still haven\u2019t reached out to her and I don\u2019t know if I will. I feel like her letter may be genuine but I don\u2019t think I will ever trust her again for obvious reasons. I feel like she sees it as an \u201ceasier to has forgiveness than permission\u201d sort of thing. I\u2019m in a hard place of trying to decide how to assert my authority as a mother without alienating my child from people who love them. I don\u2019t want my forgiveness to seem like weakness and in the end put my child in more situations like this.\nI\u2019ve been getting help with all this in therapy, which I have started twice a week. Right now the general guidance I get from my therapist is don\u2019t make any big moves yet (divorce, moving long distances, cutting people out ect) so I\u2019m taking it day by day. I make sure my husband sees our child every day. We don\u2019t talk about the state of our marriage yet. I told him when I was ready we will talk. He\u2019s respected that and it\u2019s made a huge difference in the hope I have for our future. \n\nSo that is really it. There weren\u2019t really any dramatic blow ups or legal action. There are still a lot of unanswered questions for me but this time has been one filled with self-discovery and support from a lot of unexpected places and for that I\u2019m incredibly grateful. \n\n\nTLDR: Thank you everyone for your support. Taking life day by day. I love my baby. ",

We don't have a car, and my husband in general likes to walk everywhere when he can.That's the relevant background info.\n\nSo, he and I were talking today about how we're going to get to the hospital (I'm due in May) and it turns out that he is assuming that we are going to walk to the hospital when I'm in labor and then walk home once we're discharged from the hospital. \n\nThis is the first time I've been pregnant, and I'm just wondering: how realistic is this idea of his? I'm more than a bit dubious, but I haven't got a good sense of what our other options are. Can I call a cab if I'm in labor and it's not an emergency? Would it be weird to ask his sister (who lives 20 minutes away) to pick us up from the hospital and drive us home? If so, how do we arrange the carseat stuff with her?\n\nSorry if this is the wrong place to ask, and for the anxious questions. I thought it would be better to ask here than on babybumps because all of you have been through childbirth already.",

            "selftext": "I made a throwaway for this because my husband knows my username and I don't feel like being surrounded by anymore drama right now. \n\nSo a little back story. My husband is an only child. His mom has always been very involved. We got along somewhat but she always sort of crossed some lines. She has a key to our house for emergency purposes only because she lives 4 blocks away.\n\nI had our daughter 4 weeks ago. She has been over at least three days every week since I've had her. She's always telling me what I am doing wrong and how she'd do things so differently. Baby is up every two hours at night and she insists she'd sleep through the night if she could stay at grandmas. I told her I'm not comfortable sending a breastfed baby away over night at 4 weeks. This last week she kept pushing the issue no matter how many times I said no. \n\nLast night we put the baby in her crib. We stopped room sharing because the baby was so loud I could get no sleep what so ever so my husband has been getting her when it's time for her to feed. Husband fell asleep early and I dozed off. I woke up four hours later and started to panic because she hadn't made any noise. I was sure she had died of sids. I went into her room and she was gone. I froze and started screaming her name around the house like she would somehow pop out like it was all a joke. My husband woke up in a panic and just screamed \"what's going on!!\" Over and over. I ran to my phone to call 911 and saw a picture message from my MIL of my sleeping baby in her arms with the caption \"sleepover at gamgams\". I was immediately enraged. I screamed so hard I almost vomited. I called her and saw red. I told her I was coming to get the baby and she would never see her again and to never contact our family again. \n\nMy husband decided it was best if he went to get her. When he came back he said his mother decides for let herself in and \"give us a break\" that she was sure we'd hear the text and she thought we would be thanking her for a nights sleep.\n\nI do not give a fuck. I hate her. I cannot forgive her for this. My husband thinks I need to calm down. That we just need to get our key back. His lack of urgency about the situation makes me want to divorce him. We have never had any issues before this but this feels like a deal breaker to me. I already had PPA and now it's through the roof. I don't feel safe in my own home with my family. I hate my MIL. I hate my husband. When I think about what happened I sob uncontrollably. I can't sleep now that I know I can't protect my baby when I sleep. I can't believe I did not wake up. I feel like the biggest piece of shit mother. If any danger really came I would have let my daughter down. \n\nAm I overreacting for wanting a divorce or for never wanting to see my MIL again? My husband and MIL think it's my hormones and I have overreacted. Am I overreacting?? I just needed to talk about it with noninvolved parties. I have no friends or family for hundreds of miles. \n\n\nOh and she also fed her formula while she had her but that's the least of my worries. It still infuriates me because breastfeeding has been really hard for us.\n\n\nUpdate: I just wanted to give everyone a quick update. I didn't respond but I've read every comment and the support I got has meant so much to me. I bawled reading them because I finally felt like someone was on my side. I called my mom late last night and I got a hotel. I refused to tell my husband where I was going but told him the baby and I would be safe. My mom is disgusted about what I've been through. She's getting on a plane today to come help me. This entire experience has pushed me to the point that I need therapy so today my first order of business is getting a therapist set up asap. I decided to go alone for a while and when I'm ready, go with my husband to see if there is a chance to move past this. Right now I still don't want to but I also agree I'm not in the place to make life changing decisions. Either way, I can never move back into that house. I don't know what my plan is past these next few days yet but I'm just going to take it day by day for right now. As for my MIL, I'm going to go to the police today to find out how to get a restraining order. Her and my husband keep saying \"but she was safe! She was never on danger!\" I disagree. My MIL is clearly not mentally capable to care for a child. Who knows what else she would do because she feels she knows best. \n\nThank you all so much. I can't tell you how much the support from some Internet strangers has meant to me.",

            "selftext": "I change my son every morning into a fresh diaper before I take off. It takes me over 25min to get to her family daycare when I leave the door. Most times he goes #2 in the car so by the time we get there, his diaper is dirty again and needs to be changed right after I drop him off. It's just the timing of things, trust me, I wish he'd go at home to prevent any risk of a diaper blow out onto the car seat but I can't control that.\n\n\nThis morning I drop him off and she starts complaining how this can't be happening every day. In her 15 years of experience she has never had a kid who needs his diaper changed first thing at drop off. He is the first one dropped off and she isn't dealing with anyone else. I can understand it can get hectic with many children running around but it's only him. She starts to suggest I wait at home for his #2 before driving over. Um, no, I'm not going to wait for a poop that may or may not happen! Besides, I need to get to this thing called _work_ so I can make money...I can't be late. Then she suggests I change him in the car before bringing him in. Oh my god, did she just say that? First off, I have no room, I drive a sedan, not a minivan or SUV. Trunk has his stroller that takes up 75% of the space, back seat has his convertible car seat in the middle, back seat and floor have various bags: my work bag with laptop, breast pump and bottles, lunch bag, daycare bag (extra outfit, his bottles for the day, bibs, etc) and sometimes my gym bag. There is no flat surface large enough to be able to change him in the car! The only possibility would be to take the stroller out and change him in the trunk where there would be a safe, flat, easily accessible surface to change him. But no, I'm not going to do that not to mention it's Winter and it's cold. I need to be on my way to work, and besides  she is the daycare provider that I pay to take care of my child such as...changing diapers! He's a baby, he poops, he'll be needing diaper changes. Ugh...I'm so upset that she would try to suggest all these things to avoid her needing to change my kid when I pay her to do exactly that! I pay her $350/week for daycare.\n\n\nAmong some other things I did not mention, I think I'm going to try and find another daycare.",

You are Not alone. You are Not a bad mother. Do not EVER feel bad or guilty about not being able to \"exclusively breastfeed\", even though you may feel the pressure to do so based on posters in maternity wards, brochures in prenatal classes, and teachings at breastfeeding classes. Apparently the hospitals are designated \"baby-friendly\" only if they promote exclusive-breastfeeding. I still remember reading a handout upon Flo's discharge from hospital with the line \"Breast Milk Should Be the Exclusive Food For the Baby for the First Six Months\" , I also remember posters on the maternity unit \"Breast is Best\". While agreeing to the benefits of breast milk, there NEED to be an understanding that it is OK to supplement with formula, and that formula is a completely viable option.\n\n\n\nAnd this, from [an article](http://herviewfromhome.com/new-mom-takes-her-own-life-after-silent-battle-with-postpartum-depression-why-all-of-us-must-share-her-friends-plea/) he linked to:\n&gt;To all those mothers out there experiencing some of these same feelings: you are not alone, and you are not a bad mother!  PPD is lying to you.  It is twisting your memories, feelings, and beliefs and reshaping them into an overwhelming falsehood.  You will not be judged, only loved, as you seek help.  To those breast-feeding mothers taking Reglan (metoclopramide) to increase milk supply: stop and do research. Reglan has detrimental side effects such as new or worsening depression, suicidal ideation and suicide.  Supplement with formula if needed.  Your baby will be just as perfect and healthy with or without the breast milk.  Having more breast milk is not worth sacrificing your mental health or possibly your life.\n\nAs someone who went through the guilt and emotional damage of not being able to breastfeed, who has spent hundreds of hours attached to a breast pump, this hit me hard. I was *lucky* that I had the mechanisms to cope. We are not all so fortunate.\n\nMamas, please take care of yourselves.",

She just recently found out it's a girl too. \nNow the topic for discussion lately is \"you guys are doing everything wrong I'm going to show you how it's really done in May\" \nShe didn't really say that but God that's what it feels like. She judges us for formula feeding and passively mentions she could never. Natures way is best. And while I do wish I was breastfeeding it just didn't work out for me (long story) no reason to make me feel inadequate. \nShe also judges us for using a pacifier saying she's going to specifically state in her baby shower invite no pacifiers. Babies shouldn't have that as a comfort. Again, to each their own but she passive aggressively mentions this when she knows our daughter uses a pacifier. \nSame with cosleeping. Our daughter sleeps in the same room as us. She mentions that a baby should sleep in their crib from the start in their own room. \nAnd oh the baby shower. I offered to plan it for her but she said it's her party and she wants it done right. No offense. She's going to also state in her invite that she wants no pink for her baby only purple and grey colors. Which I don't blame her, I'm sick of pink but she says she doesn't care if she's rude about it her baby will never wear pink. \n\nShe's also saying she's \"definitely\" going to go all natural for delivery . No epidural because for thousands of years there was no epidural and a woman should deliver their baby naturally. Uh sweetheart that's everybody's plan. I wanted to do it naturally as well but the pain became unbearable and I definitely don't regret it. The epidural was god sent. She judged me at the hospital when I delivered for getting it. I know every pregnancy is different and she might not need it but I hope she does. I can't wait to see her go through labor pains. \n\nI'm letting her have her moment and I'm excited for her but is it really necessary for her to compare herself to me and try to do things \"better\"? \nI feel it's only going to get worse after she has her baby. I hope she realizes things don't go according to plan. \nI feel so petty but she's making me feel like a bad mom for the decisions I've made for my baby. ",

Typical first time mom. I won't take my fussy kid across the country without my husband because I think the plane ride will be hard on a 5 month old and I would be alone taking care of her for a week? First time mom syndrome. Let her sleep in our bed because she very obviously doesn't feel good? Being manipulated just like a typical first time mom. I wouldn't take my freshly birthed newborn to the state fair because I didn't want her out in 90 degree heat for long periods of time? Ridiculous first time mom behavior.  \n\nEven if I am being ridiculous, I get to make the decisions for my child. I don't care if they're typical of a first time mother. I'm only 5 months in. I'm still learning and refuse to succumb to peer pressure for any situation that involves my baby. I grew her inside my body for 9 months, so you can be damn sure I will make whatever decision I feel like will be best for her outside of my body. \"First time mom\" should not be used in a negative way because it's exactly what I am and that does not make my decisions invalid. \n\nEnd rant. \n\nEdit: You all are awesome!

            "selftext": "I was at Target earlier this afternoon with my baby, just browsing. We were looking at the clearance section in women's clothing, and baby girl is just looking around happily (read: getting ready to poop up her back because she does that every freakin time we go to Target). A lady in her 40s-50s (I'm terrible with ages) was near us, and baby girl keeps smiling at her because she's a little ham and loves to smile at everybody. \n\nLady: \"She's so cute, how old is she?\"\n\nMe: \"She just turned 6 months.\"\n\nLady: \"Awe, that's such a fun age. Where did you deliver? My daughter-in-law is a labor and delivery nurse at [hospital I did not deliver at].\"\n\nMe: \"Oh, I actually delivered at [different hospital].\"\n\nLady: \"Did you have a good labor?\"\n\nMe: (thinking that I'm not sure what that's even supposed to mean) \"It wasn't too bad. I was induced for going way past my due date and ended up with an emergency c-section.\"\n\nLady: (suddenly looking very put out) \"Oh. So you didn't really give birth, then. I'm sorry to hear that, maybe you'll do better next time.\"\n\nAt that point, I was so ready to be done talking to her. I wish I'd had some sort of witty comeback, but I was too floored to say anything other than \"Have a nice day.\" Then I took my (still smiling) baby and walked away. \n\nI just don't understand the idea that c-sections are somehow inferior. Just because I didn't push her out doesn't mean I didn't give birth to my daughter. I endured 13 hours of labor, an hour of pushing during which I threw up bright yellow stomach acid, attempted vacuum extraction TWICE, baby getting stuck, her heart rate skyrocketing to 200 and not coming down, and my blood pressure plummeting to dangerously low levels. My doctor's call to do a c-section probably saved both of our lives.\n\nSo lady at Target, fuck you for implying that I'm some kind of lesser mother for having my stomach sliced open to get my baby out safely. I hope if your poor DIL ever has a baby of her own, she keeps you far away from the delivery room.\n\nOkay, rant over. \n\nOther c-section mamas: You are awesome. You're all fucking killing it at this motherhood thing.\n\nVaginal birth mamas: You're awesome too, and you're all kickass moms. \n\nYou're all great. I love everyone in this sub. Thanks for letting me vent :) \n\n",

They're kinder to the hair than a pony tail/sloppy bun, it's easier to brush through, and they can mask unwashed hair pretty well.\n\n-coffee. Energy + it helps with post partum poop troubles.\n\n-eggs are awesome. You can put them in a ton of dishes, and they're easier to cook than other protein sources. \n\nI'm probably forgetting some.\n\nEdit-Stain removal (specifically baby poop):\n\n-bucket+lukewarm water+oxyclean. Soak overnight, and hose the clothes off before and after in the shower.\n\nMisc:\n\n-join your local baby buy/sell group. They usually sell clothes in batches so you don't have to waste time shopping, plus they're great for decluttering and getting rid of things you would otherwise throw away (though I usually donate my stuff).

I forgot a spoon, so I go to get one, and what do I find when I come back?  My MIL feeding her chips.  \n\nNow...I'm not hating on anyone who decides to feed their baby potato chips.  None of my business.  However, I do not want my child eating junk so early in life.  We made it very clear to MIL that we only want her eating nutritious foods.\n\nMy husbands sister has a son 4 days older than my daughter, and even at 4 months, that child was eating junk food and drinking soda.  I guess since MIL watches her son a lot, she assumes all babies eat this way?  Even though we have made it clear what we do, and do not want her eating.\n\nSo, naturally, I say something to her.  And I was nice about it.  I just politely asked to please not give her junk, it's empty calories, and that does nothing for her.  She gets MAD, and says that's the chips are better than the food I made her since \"oatmeal sits on the shelves for months\"   and she needs to be eating more than apples or she won't get any teeth (still can't figure out the logic in that one).  She goes on to tell me that my SIL feeds her son everything they eat (and they eat very unhealthy), so I need to lighten up because food is food.  All I could say without being completely rude was \" are we really about to have an argument about what my baby eats?  Because I promise I'll win\".  She didn't say anything.\n\nI'm sorry.  SIL can feed her kid junk if she wants, but I shouldn't feel bad about not giving any to mine.\n\nEnd rant.",

He's not in daycare, since I'm on Mat Leave for a year (Canadian style) so there's no added germ exposure. Sometimes we'll bathe him more frequently if he's been exposed to a large amount of people, or relatives who smoke and assume they are covering it up with that awful-smelling lotion (thanks MIL, yuck..), or if he's generally smellier than usual.\n\nWhat's your bath situation like?",

He (I think it was a he) was more or less mocked in the comments for things he liked and the amount of money spent on certain items. \n\nI don't understand why we aren't even allowed to say \"breast is best\" anymore because that's \"shaming\" other parents and their choices, yet parents of two or more children are allowed to shit on choices that first time parents make, especially financially. My husband and I use Honest Brand diapers (they're cute and don't give my kid a butt rash), we only use wooden toys, and choose organic skincare items, etc which seems like a waste of money to some people. Sure. My family is constantly saying things like we will \"grow out of wasting money\" or \"just wait until your next one.\" First of all we aren't having a \"next one\" and if we want to spend our money on golden plated diamond encrusted diapers we will. That doesn't make us naive to the wonders of cheap diapers. People make different choices. People have different budgets. Who the hell cares if someone wants to spend $50 on a changing pad or deems a rubber ass spatula a \"must have?\" They don't know less than you. They're just different. Get off it. ",

If you could go back in time and smack some sense into your pregnant self...what would you return and why? Did someone gift you something completely useless and now it just takes up space? What is a must-not-buy item for you and your home? \n\nI'll start...I sincerely regret the purchase of the whole huge stroller travel system. I bought a Chicco Bravo system, with the stroller, the bucket seat and the snap in bottom. Now the bucket seat I could see buying but on it's own. It was handy while she was a newborn and we could get away with eating at a restaurant and she would nap away. I do not, however, recommend the whole damn thing. The stroller is HUGE...I watched the dude fold it up and sort of jam the floor model into my car sideways, and honestly, I don't know why my pregnant brain let me continue to buy it! It took up the whole trunk space and couldn't be put into the backseat for safety reasons as it could fall onto her carseat. No room for the diaper bag or even a box of Kleenex back there, never mind the idea of groceries. Maybe with a bigger car it might be better but no way was it a good idea for mine. Why pregnant brain, why didn't you stop and think 'hey maybe we should look for something smaller?'\n\nI got a GB QBit stroller that folds down super tiny now but the Bravo is still sitting around. Pretty soon she's going to be growing out of the bucket seat and into a convertible. So much money wasted...arrgh! I should just list it for like 25 bucks on CL to get rid of the damn thing. Ladies shopping for a stroller, think about trunk space and how much crap your baby will already be throwing into your car. Need space for the whole damn house! ",

            "selftext": "I guess I just feel like I'm alone in this world of putting your baby in a dark room alone and thinking it's crazy to be surprised when it won't sleep 12 hours straight by itself?\n\nI know I'm exaggerating, but there so many posts about this.\n\nWe expect babies to sleep and get the hang of being alone without food or water or comfort for sooo many hours. \n\nSo when it doesn't happen we are pissed because we still have the expectations of getting as much stuff done as we did pre-baby?\n\nI just think it's all crazy. Just all the expectations on moms and dads. \n\nThere really needs to be more studies in bed sharing. I mean, that's how humans have evolved.\n\nI think I'm mostly pissed I didn't learn about safe bed sharing for so long and I was so nervous that I was doing something wrong by doing it in the beginning.\n\nMy baby was born underweight and wouldn't take a pacifier.\n\nI timed how long he would nurse for a while in the beginning and it averaged out to be 13.5 hours every 24. That's not counting when he would sleep on me.\n\nThis left zero time for me to sleep. It got better when he hit 4.5 months and tripled his birthweight.\n\nBut what was I supposed to do, not sleep for 4.5 months?\n\nI dozed on the recliner while nursing him and freaked out. That's when j researched safe bed sharing guidelines. I don't understand how I was supposed to safely nurse him and hold him while he slept.\n\nI finally felt a little better after reading that Japan has the lowest rate of SIDS (which used to be called crib/cot death) and they have the highest rate of bed sharing moms that breastfeed and don't smoke.\n\nI spent hours and hours on my phone making sure there wasn't anything I missed about safe bed sharing. I'm one that totally goes by rules so I was uncomfortable with it for a while, but I didn't know what else to do.\n\nI just wish I would have known all this before having my baby (also about how hard it is to breastfeed in the beginning).\n\nI recently had my sons 1st bday party. An older relative was there and I mentioned how my baby just doesn't like to sleep alone and she said, \"well of course not, he's only a baby!\" And I just wanted to say, \"THANK YOU YES!!!\" I mean he's 1, so more like a \"boddler\", but no one has ever understood that this is just how babies are and its okay to comfort them as much as you want.\n\nI just feel like in regards to my babies sleep it's this big secret shameful thing I do.\n\nI don't have the ability to sleep train even if I wanted to (bedtime changes based on temperature of bedroom, can't keep it consistent all night, loud parking lot).\n\nAnyway, for those of you that don't sleep with your babies, great. No one should bed share if they can't do it safely. But it's also important to not get any sleep and drive. Which is what lots of parents end up doing, because they have to.\n\nI just think it's all insane is all.\n\nThanks for reading, this was a weird rant.\n\nI would love to know about other parents that bedshare and what they did or changed to make it safe? I for example had to put my mattress on the floor, buy cardigans to sleep in so I wouldn't need a blanket and could breastfeed, lol. I don't remember what else I changed because it's been so long from me sleeping any other way.\n\nEdit: sorry, the title of my post is meant to mean I don't think it's insane to bedshare, but I don't think it's insane not to. \n\n\nI was exaggerating by saying cold dark room part. I mean I meant to say it was from the example of why a baby wouldn't be able to fall asleep in a situation. It just seems like people have an expectation that they should and this sub is full of babies under 6 months not being able to sleep and being exhausted because of it. But if that's what you do, awesome!\n\nI'm sorry I came off as judgy--if my baby has slept in his crib, he would be sleeping there until this day for sure!",

I'm dying to know.\n\nMy MIL is staying with me, 3 week old LO, and the hubs for the week. She is not impressed by my new fangled parenting. She does the following weird (and disrespectful) things against my wishes (of course DH doesn't say shit to dear old mom).\n\nRefuses to swaddle LO when she watches her. Refuses to put her in the cosleeper to nap. I caught her putting her in the crib, unswaddled, with a fucking blanket up near her face. Unless we insist on our nap time routine, she ignores our ways. Like, way to let my kid startle herself awake a half-hour later and thanks for the SIDS.\n\nMakes nasty comments about the white noise machine sounding bad and being silly. Like, sorry you don't like it, lady. It only puts her to sleep and keeps her asleep.\n\nWhispers when the baby is asleep, even though we all speak in regular voices because the baby is used to noise. She shoots daggers at us for speaking at a normal volume. The womb is almost as loud as a chainsaw, lady. She's fine.\n\nDoesn't wash her hands before or after changing a diaper. Caught her wiping LO back to front. Caught her putting diaper ointment on her when she still had some poop on her and didn't even have a rash. Asked where the baby powder was and why weren't we using it. So yeah, she doesn't change diapers anymore.\n\nMakes nasty, judgmental faces when I pump or BF then have a beer with a friend coming over. I wait until I feel totally normal or an hour plus after I finish my drink to BF or pump again, you know like La Leche League says is JUST FUCKING FINE. And god forbid I give her formula every once in a while! I guess she didn't get the memo that one drink is no big deal and pump-n-dump is a myth.\n\nWill not stick to our routine. I had multiple long appointments for a health issue yesterday. I left LO with my husband and her, and she got a total of 45 minutes sleep THE WHOLE DAY. She was absolutely exhausted and basically distraught by bedtime. I had to let her comfort nurse for about an hour to get her to calm down.\n\nGIVE ME STRENGTH OMFG",

            "selftext": "I'm using a throwaway because I guess I'm a little embarrassed.  I was a heavy drinker before getting pregnant.  My mantra was \"work hard, play hard\" so I was totally responsible/sober during the week and got drunk with my friends every weekend.  After pregnancy/baby, my tolerance is obviously way down and I've found myself drunk on more occasions than I'd prefer.  It usually starts innocently, but then I get a couple drinks in me (and this is especially true when I'm catching up with friends) I end up drinking more than I intend to.  Besides my low tolerance, it's also due to me just having a lot of fun \"like the old days\" and I want to keep going.  Then I find myself hungover and feel guilty.  This happens about twice a month.  My baby is always safe and taken care of, and I don't think I'm an alcoholic or anything, but I want to stop because I don't like the way it makes me feel.  I would be fine with getting drunk on special occasions (at a wedding for example) but I really don't want to come home wasted after brunch with a girlfriend, which is what happened this weekend.  So, my question is, moms who were heavy drinkers before baby, what is your relationship with alcohol now?  When alcohol was previously a go-to source of fun, how do you keep yourself in check, especially when you're surrounded by childless friends who still drink like there's no tomorrow?  I'm thinking that I need something like a \"no more than 2 drinks\" rule, but I don't know how to force myself to follow that.  I'd love to hear your advice. \nedit:spelling\n\nEdit:  Wow I really appreciate all the great suggestions and judgement free responses.  I knew that alcoholism would be mentioned, and while I definitely agree that my pre-baby binge drinking habit wasn\u2019t healthy, I honestly don\u2019t feel I fit that bill in my current situation.  I put a lot of pressure on myself to be this perfect, always responsible mother, and when I don\u2019t live up to that, like having more drinks that I intend to while out with friends, I guilt myself.  I took away a lot of great suggestions to keep that from happening in the future (alternating with water, pacing myself, drinks with lower alcohol levels, trying out the 2-drink max rule, ect).  It was also brought to my attention that one of the biggest issues here might be my friendships. The foundation for a lot of my friendships was built on binge drinking, and so many of these people are simply drinking buddies, and if I want to continue to be friends with them, we should try to do more non-drinking activities together.  I\u2019m living a different lifestyle now, and true friends will respect that.  Ultimately I\u2019m just trying to find the appropriate balance between being the responsible mother and still allowing myself to have fun and drink occasionally.  Thanks for your help, everyone!  ",

Mowed grass/dirt area. No nearby streets, seriously, nice safe area. A lady jumps up like she's gonna go get her. I interject like \"oh she's fine, thanks\". They all seemed SOOOO concerned that this kid was walking in grass...\ud83d\ude28\n\nAnother time when we were at the park, I was letting her get out some energy by walking instead of sitting in the stroller. Toddler picks up a rock. A pretty big rock, not one you could choke on. Nearby guy is all like \"ma'am!!! She has a rock!!!\" *Ummm yup, that would be a rock. That's correct.*\n\nHanging out at my friend's. Toddler walking in the backyard. \"Is she *allowed* to just walk around?\" *Yeah, or else I wouldn't let her?* \"But what if she puts dirt in her mouth?\" I laughed out loud at that one. Omg DIRT!??!!\n\nGot concerned looks when she fell at the playground once too. She didn't even cry, just jumped back up and kept running! Lol\n\n\nThere are some things I'm not chill about. I make sure she eats healthy, I'm big on car seat safety, stuff like that. But I let my kid explore and sometimes she falls down and sometimes she gets dirty. What's the deal with people? Can anyone else relate?",

Is it the fact that my \"white\" features have toned down my husband's sharper Asian features? My baby is suddenly more \"exotic\" because \"his eyes are squinty\"?

I've just started saying no and making up stories about how I acquired this infant. \"I found him in a box.\" \"I stole him from someone in the parking lot.\" \"He just started following me around.\"  I am open to more suggestions for this absurd question. \n\n5. \"Some people might think he has down's syndrome because he looks just different.\" I shit you not. Words said to my face. It's bad enough that my husband gets mistaken for \"a Mexican\" by ignorants. But now my baby looks like he has downs syndrome because his eyes are slanty...

Tired of waking up to piles of barf. Tired of the smell. My one declawed cat has decided being outside is the only thing that makes him happy and yowls incessantly if he is inside, so, he is now an outdoor cat. \n\nI contacted a local shelter that rehomes adult cats, but they are full. The local no-kill shelter only takes \"found\" cats and won't take surrendered ones. I would love to take them back to the Humane Society where we got them but I don't want them to be euthanized just because we had a change of heart. We did make a commitment to them, after all. And no one wants to adopt an adult cat. So . . . \n\nAnyone else going through this?\n\nEdit:\n\nIt isn't as if the outdoor cat isn't cared for. He meows to be let in, and we let him in (at any hour) he eats, maybe sleeps, then asks to go back out . . . I am taking him to the vet this week to make sure his shots are updated. I still brush him. So, calm down. ",

I understand everyone has different opinions and they are entitled to them, but it bothers me when people say that you absolutely should not bed share. \n\nIt is definitely possible to bedshare safely. How do I know this? From researching about for *months* after my doctor told me I should try it. When the doctor initially said this, I laughed at them and said I would never risk his life like that. \n\nI was not sleeping at night, and I mean that literally. I would take a nap when SO was home and that was it. Baby is super high needs and very clingy. The crib was never an option for us. I tried everything I could and it just wasn't happening. I was absolutely terrified of sleeping with him, even though I breastfeed, don't smoke, am a light sleeper and dad doesn't sleep in bed with me. I spent so much time reading about SIDS, to the point where I was having anxiety attacks every single night. \n\nI eventually gave in. No blankets or pillows near baby, not to hot and no medication. He's 6 months old, healthy, strong, crawling and sitting on his own. I still get *so* scared every night, but I talk myself down and get into bed with babe, so that I can get a few hours of sleep before I have to wake up with my older child. \n\nAnd then last night I reply to this thread, and get quite a few comments saying that I should never sleep with him, something can go horribly wrong, think of the baby, etc. I'm sure these people are just unaware of the number of families that actually bedshare, but it really bothered me that people have no problem saying things like that to moms that they don't know. Different people have different situations and circumstances. Yes, bedsharing is not recommended, but - some of us don't have a choice and all we can do is do it as safely as possible.\n\nI already barely sleep at all (as I'm sure you can tell by my incoherent ramble) and last night I slept even less. Please don't assume that you know more about someone's situation, or that there is a be all and end all answer for everything. It should be up to the families and their doctors to decide. \n\nThank you to anyone who read this mess. \n\n/rant ",

I say this with love because I was there myself not too long ago!\n\nSo, after all the /r/BabyBumps posts ranting about shower guests going off-registry, now that you're a mom, do you go off-registry yourself?
