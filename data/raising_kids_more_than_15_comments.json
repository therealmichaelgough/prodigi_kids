            "selftext": "I'm hoping for some advice from someone who has maybe gone through something similar. My son has been refusing to participate in pretty much everything. He's turning 5 in a month, we put him in soccer this summer and every game was a struggle. He would make up excuses not to play, usually said he was too tired. Now we put him in swimming, he loved the lessons he took in the spring in the small pool but now his lessons are in the big pool that is colder and deeper, he can't touch the bottom. I can understand him being maybe a bit scared so we brought him as a family (my husband and younger daughter and I) and he had a great time. We brought him to try out a jujitsu class and he loved it so we signed him up and now he's gone to two lessons and they have both been disastrous. He refused to participate. Just sat on the mat. We've tried talking to him, being very encouraging and understanding that something new can be a bit off putting at first. I just don't know what the right thing to do is. Pull him out of these after school activities, keep him in and continue to fight these battles all the time, or...?",

He sleeps through the night and is doing great during the day, except he hardly ever naps... like almost never on his own. He will fall asleep when moving i.e. car seat/baby carrier, but when he stops moving he often wakes up. He will get to the point of being overtired and crying himself to sleep on an almost daily basis.  I understand that if he sleeps well at night he wont sleep as much during the day, but he needs at least one good nap a day, otherwise he gets cranky...but he wont go down without crying for awhile, and I dont want him to become reliant on falling asleep in my arms.  and due to him sleeping through the night he eats and is hungry every 1.5 to 2 hours during the day...If it weren't for the support I have at home, I'd never have a spare minute...\nPacifiers only help if hes super tired...he generally doesnt care for them that much.  He hates being swaddled up tight and just struggles against it.  He does great with the swaddle up sack at night, but still fights it during the day.  My only other option is to get blackout curtains for his room...but itd be nice not to mess up the day/night cycle he has going...any suggestions?",

(wasn't happy with the toys handed out to her)  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo in a moment of (brilliance?  okay probably way over stepping here ..  above average parenting?)   I cut myself off being saying \"don't be bossy\"  and instead I told her if she's going to be in charge to make sure everyone is having fun.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd love to think anytime a parent is telling their kids not to be bossy it's because the kid \"in charge\" of the game is making it unfun for others.      Its not her being in charge i have a problem with.  its her not realizing her siblings are not having fun.        so in the moment i thought of that rewording.      like hey if you are running this restaurant game, make sure everyone is having fun.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd she did.  she quickly figured out my youngest daughter wanted a specific play pot and certain toy vegetables, and soon everyone was playing happily and i think she got a better message / lesson than just \"don't be bossy\"",

We waited at the bus stop because he was excited about the bus but when it came he couldn\u2019t do it.  Huge meltdown.  Wanted me to ride with him.  I had to take him off the bus.  Then go wait in the drop off line to take him into his class.  So much crying.  Another meltdown in his classroom.  I had to leave the classroom and go to the office to make sure they changed his status to drop off and pick up rather than bus.  Walked out and cried for an hour.  At daycare I could check the camera to see he was ok then go on with my day but this is different I worry about his safety because the teacher has so many kids and nobody knows how he is and he can be a runner.  It\u2019s a lot for me, I\u2019m a nervous wreck.\n\nSo to see all the pictures of happy kids getting on busses this morning made me feel like shit.",

He's already hit 3 other boys in his class and no matter how much I talk to him about about what he should do in these situations it doesn't seem to be clicking with him.\n\nWe don't practice corporal punishment in our house and his mother and I have taken positive parenting classes. We are honestly terrified that he's going to get kicked out of school.\n\nIf anyone has any advice on how to handle this I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks for taking the time to read.",

Shes 4 and I let her ride her bike up and down end to end but not around. I walk outside every 10 minutes to check on her and usually shes playing with a specific child at their house at the time. Shes already proven to me over 2 months that shes not going to go past the boundaries Ive set or in the parking lot. Ive actually asked other mothers if Im wrong for allowing her to do this and all have said no..Im wondering if theyre being kind because they only let their kids go out if theyre out there too- then again these parents  have a child where 1 wanders off and gets in trouble constantly for it, 1 is autistic and the others my daughter plays with at their house with their parents outside. I trust her and my parents are OK with it-but I want to know what other people think about it.",

            "selftext": "I recently returned from a trip to Europe to see family with my wife and daughter. My daughter is 9 years old and suffers from a mild anxiety disorder where she freaks out over tiny things and lets her fear nearly paralyze her ability to rationalize. Riding her bike down a steep hill at full speed? No problem... Riding horses, driving go karts, easy peasy... spider in the room? Complete and total melt down.  Its not uncommon but is often misdiagnosed as a type of ADHD. We have a little exercise we use when she's having one of these \"attacks\", we say a quote from from the story Dune by Frank Herbert. Some of you may recognize it, \"I must not fear, fear is the mind killer. I will face my fear and let it pass through me. When it is gone there will be nothing, only I will remain.\" We do this so she doesn't become completely paralyzed by fear over something she has total control over. I like to think having this ability could save her life someday by giving her the ability to recognize what is happening and use her mind to figure out how to get out of a potentially life threatening situation.\n\nSo, my daughter had a minor episode when she realized she was gonna be sitting next to a stranger, a young woman, on the plane but still just across the aisle from her mother. No bid deal right? Not for her, she starts crying and everyone that was already boarded watches what happens.  My wife convinces the person next to her to switch seats easily and everything is resolved quickly. I'm sitting just two seats in front of her. I turn around in my seat and reassuring get her attention, and say \"what do we say honey?\" She looks me in the eye and almost immediately I can see a bit of relief in her eyes. \"Fear is the mind killer.\" That's my girl, I'm thinking to myself proudly as I turn to face forward in my seat... and then this fat cow sitting across the aisle from me opens her mouth. \"Her fear is completely natural and justified. She should be scared of strangers.\"\n\nUgh, ok this woman obviously isn't getting what just happened. Politely, I  try to say thank you but she continues. \"In fact 80% of child abuse happens from someone the child knows...\" She turns to look at her and I look back and see my daughter look back at her uncomfortably and then back at me, a bit confused.\n\nShe turns and looks at me and continues, \"you shouldn't be teaching her not to be afraid, it's the proper reaction...\" I cut her off and said a with a firm voice but relatively low as not to cause a scene, \"Mind your god damn business lady.\" She looked like I told her I was gonna assault her or something. \"You obviously don't understand the context of what's happening here. I'm not trying to teach her not to be scared, I'm trying to teach her not to let it shut down her ability to think... if she can do that on her own she would see that there's nothing to he scared of and she can figure out what to do next.\" I got a little more firm in my composition for this last bit and said, \"Don't ever try to tell someone in public how to raise their kids. It's rude, and if I wanted your opinion I would have asked for it.\" I turned to face forward, clearly signaling this conversation was over. I put on my headphones and started my downloaded copy of Starlords Zune.... there's nothing quite like sitting next to someone uncomfortably for 2 hours listening to disco.\n\n\nTL/DR: Person on plane tried to tell me how to raise my kid so I told them to mind their own damn business.",

He also told me that he knows his dad often makes comments that make him uncomfortable \u201cwhy is your hair so long? You trying to be a little girl?\u201d Stuff like that. (The reason I allow him to make his own choice of visitation) \n\nAnyways I spoke to his father about it and I got this text back.... what do you guys think? Would therapy be a good choice? I just don\u2019t want him thinking he\u2019s broken because he\u2019s not, he\u2019s still my same caring sweet kid. HELP! \n\nText: http://imgur.com/t9C7ewz",

I know at that age he's unable to say I'm stressed or having anxiety about something and therefore eating at night, and hoping it is not anything worse than just anxiety maybe.

            "selftext": " \n\nHey guys!\n\nHow to play the piano for kids by PianoCourse101 is based on the Bastien Piano Basic Series for children. The Bastien Piano Basic Series consists of four levels. There are the \"Primer Level\", \"Level 1\", \"Level 2\" and \"Level 3\". I will eventually be uploading all of the courses on youtube. The first few lessons of the \"Primer Level\" are free and available on youtube while the rest of the lessons will be available on my website, which will be announced pretty soon. Lesson 1, Lesson 2 and Lesson 3 are paid courses. I believe that PianoCourse101 offers piano lessons that is not only well structured by engaging for children. Utilising a white board with rhythm exercises, explaining terms in a visually presentable manner is one unique method in making learning fun for kids.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC\\_pzmnmzz\\_4RT0lPFFnRWyQ?sub\\_confirmation=1](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_pzmnmzz_4RT0lPFFnRWyQ?sub_confirmation=1)",

            "selftext": "I hear watch out for those terrible two's the closer my son gets to that age. But he hit 18 months and it seems like he throws tantrums at least once every 2 or 3 days. Some days, it's because he's tired and doesnt want to sleep. Other days, like today, he didn't want to eat, drink, or want to be put down on the floor (everyone gets those crabby moods sometimes). \n\nMy son is on a pretty good schedule but lives in 2 separate households with different parenting styles. My mom and I let him do his thing as long as he isnt doing anything dangerous or breaking stuff. He plays with his toys, watches TV, goes outside, and goes on shopping trips. \n\nDad is very relaxed, and lazy with him (which is fine). Dad let's him do the same as my mom. I think he listens to him more so than with us but that happens with every child. \n\nGrandma (dads mom) spoils him a little. I only know because when he cries she picks him up and treats him like a baby, make sure hes okay, even if he only wants to use her to get out of the crib. (There is probably more from what I've heard but I dont know for sure so I'll leave it at that.)\n\nWhat do you do when a child throws a tantrum?\nShould you let them cry it out?\nHow do you go about correcting the behavior?\nDoes it get better when they start speaking more?\nI feel like it's become a frequent thing with him and I just want to go about it the right way.",

Today though in the afternoon she fell asleep on the couch watching TV and pissed herself. I have tried washing the cushion but the smell of pee can still be sensed. When I told my brother what happened when he came to pick her up he threatened to spank her but never offered to have my couch cleaned.",

            "selftext": "I have volunteered to help a friend by watching her 5-year-old son one afternoon per week. He's a great kid, but he's from a lower-income, single-parent family with two siblings and doesn't get much one-on-one attention at home which causes him to act out. He loves roughhousing and climbing on things. He also loves playing with action figures, but all he does with them is \"fight\" which basically just means smash them to bits against each other (all of his toys are broken and/or missing pieces). He's a bit developmentally delayed and definitely has an extremely short attention span for anything that is not immediately engaging. He's not super confident and often gets picked on by both his older and younger brothers. I think his lack of confidence also causes him to \"give up\" on a task as soon as it becomes difficult.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast time I watched him, I googled some games to play with young kids and tried \"Hot and Cold\" and \"Simon Says\" (with his brothers). Neither one really worked well. He stopped listening to Simon after about 2 directions. He liked BEING Simon but didn't understand the whole idea of not saying \"Simon Says\" in order to get other people out of the game. I think he just liked telling people what to do! Which I indulged him in for a while but he kept reusing the same 3 directions and the game got very old very quickly lol. For the \"Hot and Cold\" game he just couldn't grasp what \"warmer\" and \"colder\" mean and kept wanting me to hide the toy in the same place so he could find it easily. When he hid the toy, he would just point at where it was without giving the \"hotter/colder\" clues.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd love to spend our time together doing activities that will help him learn and grow, so I'm looking for some ideas. I'll have him for 4-5 hours so I'm hoping we could do one active and one creative/intellectual activity each week (yes, yes, I know about the \"best laid plans of mice and men\" but I still want to try). Since I don't have THAT much time with him, I want activities that give a lot of \"bang for my buck\" developmentally speaking. I have a car so we don't have to stay in the house and and I'm willing to purchase a few toys/board games/art supplies that might help. Any ideas? Thanks!",

We chalked it up to just missing until last week when I decided to do spring cleaning while the kids were in school.\n\nI flipped my sons mattress up and I found some of his sisters missing clothes. Of course when he came home I questioned him but he pretended he didnt know where they came from.\n\nOn Saturday after my daughter went to her friends I had called my son down to the living room. I explained to him that I knew it was him who took the clothes which he tried to deny but I explained that he wasnt in trouble and i would rather him be open with me. He still refused to admit he did it so I asked if he would like his own clothing. After about 2 minutes in awkward silence and him being bright red in the face and tears coming down he slightly nodded his head yes.\n\nThat afternoon we went to the store and I let him choose a few outfits and undergarments. I told him that he can choose if he wants to wear any of it around us and assured him again it was okay.\n\nShould I talk to his older sister about this so she knows in case he does want to wear around the house. Also any advice on allowing it in public?",

If not would you start &amp; what would you say to them that would help ? \n\nEvery morning I pick my daughter ( 3 ) up in front of the mirror and repeat several mantras for her to repeat \n\nFor Example: \n\nMe: Whose a Smart &amp; Beautiful Princess?\nHer: I am \nMe: Louder My smart &amp; Beautiful Princess \nHer: I\u2019m a smart &amp; Beautiful Princess Daddy \n\nOr \n\nMe: Your so smart and always loved bc you are so amazing &amp; Beyond special \nMe: You can be anything you want bc you are unstoppable \nMe: Mommy and Daddy Love you so much , We are so happy to spend time with you. \nHer: *Cheering on to every word lol*\n\nI only started 2-3 months ago but I noticed a drastic change in her moods ( less temper tantrums , better sleep patterns , confidence and increase in happiness ) \n\nWhat other Encouraging/Positive things can I include to our morning routine? \n\nThanks in advance.",

She either poops in her pants or just doesn\u2019t wipe good enough, but it\u2019s constant and been going on since she was 5 pretty much. HELP!!!! \n\nShe leaves messes on toilets every where she goes. I have to look at my toilet seat every time I use it to make sure there isn\u2019t poop on it.\n\nShe acts like she likes it or something and doesn\u2019t care that she stinks or anything. She will sit in her poop all day and all night if we don\u2019t make sure she is clean. She calls them accidents but I\u2019ve started to not allow that because 4 times in a week is not an accident. \nWe have tried everything, from making her wash her underwear and pants in the bath, Counseling. Bringing a change of clothes. Baby wipes. Checking her underwear every time she goes to the bathroom, watching her shower to make sure she is cleaning properly. \nHer dad will not allow me to put her in pull ups since she is 9 and he feels that embarrassing her will make it worse .... but I am at my wits end and am about to start spanking her every time.

We have a 4 year old a 3 year old and a 2 year old and a 6 month old (Boy) I know they are super close in age, I've heard it all. The last 2 were not planned to arrive for a while and apparently birth control isn't as full proof as you'd think. \n\nSo my girls day in and day out are just awful to their Mom and it breaks me to leave for work every day knowing the kind of day she is in for. They don't listen at all, They Hit each other constantly and are nasty to each other (even our two year old has started really laying into her sisters) But anytime they are told no or don't get what they want they full on collapse on the floor and throw a fit. We have tried walking away and ignoring them, we have tried putting them in their room (not in trouble) but just so they understood that they need to stay in there until they calm down and gather themselves. We have tried to be really patient but be firm with the kids in what is acceptable and what is not. We have tried using a sticker chart as motivation and letting them pick a toy to post next to the chart as a visual aid to help them understand what they are working for. Nothing works. I know they are girls and girls tend to be more dramatic (I am the only boy of 5 siblings) but I feel like it's a little much, I am legitimately worried about sending my 5 year old to school if she is just going to be a cry baby and a horrible child at school. \n\nAny suggestions? I feel like I am out of ideas, I feel like I know how to work excellent with teenagers because I worked with troubled youth for 5 years, but little kids that don't understand... I am clueless.",

            "selftext": "A Suggestion For Better Female Role Models\nAs pre-dotage older guy I propose a better set of female roll models than current pop culture would suggest. I write this, because women with young girls ensconced, are pretty busy as it is, and have little excess time to mine the culture for hidden artifacts.\nIn the day and age of me too and pussy hats, pop culture is racing to appeal to the next generation of women. Block busters like super hero Wonder Woman, tough gals like Atomic Blonde and gal pal heist movies like Oceans 8 are all the rage. To be clear I enjoyed these works. They take us through the transformation of women from shrinking violets to progenitors of sanctioned mayhem, hitherto the province of Superman, James Bond and the Pink Panther. Successfully bringing a feminine touch to godhood, violence with extreme prejudice, and taking stuff in manipulative and clever ways, all in the face of malevolent adversity.  \nPerhaps representing these classic and relatively simplistic male architypes misses the point. I would suggest a more realistic and nuanced exploration of female competency as demonstrated in the science fiction series The Expanse. These books and video series (about to start it 4th season (I am a booster not a shill)), has 5 main female characters, all strong, all independent, all commensurately competent in their professional capacities, all different, each flawed \u2013 as is the human condition. \nA master politician plucking the strings of governance at the highest level, a Martian marine, chief engineer/first officer of a warship, a starship captain/XO, a rich mover and shaker, and a political theologian. This is what a post-feminist world really looks like. Powerful imperfect women skillfully executing their moments in history, independent of any sexual competency overlay. Yet they still get to be women without making any compromises or twisting their ankles fleeing an inverted ice cream cone; sorry old Frank Zappa refence (now you can count my tree rings).\nPost feminism is where you can shoot someone, put on a nice outfit, get grease under your nails, plot a coup, fuck up a souffle, have time to bump uglies with your spouse and still save the world. All while rendering the issue of how many X\u2019s you have irrelevant. Post feminism is the absence of feminism, because it has accomplished it mission and is no longer needed or relevant. Going to be awhile before we get there, but substantial progress is being made on the forefront. This show gives us a glimpse.\nThe world could seriously use a Chrisjen Avasarala right now. Please note while she has been treated well in the transformation from page to screen (as has the entire series) and is played with formidable gravitas by Shohreh Aghdashloo, in the books she swears like Marine drill instructor. Gotta say I miss that characterization; some serious word crafting went into her profound profanity. The story can get complex and books may have to wait for a teen reader, but the show is fine for all but the most tender (someone does get punctured by a projectile, but the gross FX are kept to a minimum). The first 3 years are on line and cable, leading up to season 4. Take a preview, see what you think. \nMagic lassos, the ability to take damage a pro fighter would have trouble sustaining, and elegantly lying to steal shit may not be providing the best role models. Competent execution of duty to humanity might be better. Oh, and you don\u2019t get to be a real STEP person unless you embrace a little science fiction \u2013 it is not all just space opera. Now where did I put my towel?\n",

A growing body of research has found that risky outdoor play is a key part of children\u2019s health, promoting social interactions, creativity, problem-solving, and resilience. \n\nSome communities are even experimenting with \u201cadventure playgrounds,\u201d a format with origins in World War II Denmark, where bomb sites became impromptu playgrounds.

As a mother, I understand we all worry for our children's safety and health and thought it would be a good gift.\n\nHowever, I would like to know if it is as useful a gift as I think it is? It has an iPhone/Android app that is similar to Google Maps which shows the child's location in real time. Would you guys buy one of these? If so, is $99 plus a $7.99/month in-app subscription reasonable?",

            "selftext": "Hi. I have a friend who\u2019s in her late 30s and has a 5 year old an an 11 year old. She\u2019s been changing the country they\u2019re living in each year. And not after school is over for the year, but during the schoolyear. Just when it looked like she\u2019s finally found some stability, she has given up her apartment contract again and moved out with the intention of moving to Spain next month. \n\nShe has taken her oldest daughter out of school again - a school she really liked and only started in this year.\n\nI\u2019m seriously concerned about the mental wellbeing of the 11 year old. I\u2019m not a parent myself but don\u2019t kids need stability?\n\nThe mom is justifying her actions by saying she\u2019s \u201cworldschooling\u201d her children, but I don\u2019t buy it. It just looks like plain old pathological instability, not some pre-planned \u201cworldschooling\u201d project. Because those changes have never been ple-planned. She gets an idea to move and does it two months later. So far her kids have lived in four different countries over the course of the last 8 years. \n\nAm I paranoid or is there something going on? Should I contact someone?\n",

Please be respectful and considerate of each other.  Everyone's family is different and what works for one child/family might not be the right decision for another child/family.\n\n",

With that being said I was thinking for Santa instead of saying he is real and you get nothing if you are bad (which I feel is just bad parenting, instead of take responsibility of raising your child you pawn it off to something else) I feel I should just explain the concept of Christmas of being nice and giving etc and that Santa is just a face but he isn\u2019t a real man, he was based of a real man and marketing by coke but he isn\u2019t real. I feel the morality of doing good for the sake of humanity is a better way to raise a child rather than the reward system. You be good and you get good things. What ya think?",

            "selftext": "My son for the past few months has said after visiting his Dad that his dad wants him to go to Auckland Grammar and board there. He has not spoken to me directly about it ever. Tonight when I went to drop his sister to his dad\u2019s he came downstairs and said Mum I need to tell you something and I\u2019m like ok what and he said Dad\u2019s got the application form and told me not to tell you yet. Well I couldn\u2019t handle hearing that again so said sorry please ask your father to come out and talk to me. To cut a long story short his father yelled at me that I didn\u2019t care about my sons education and as neither of us live in zone our son would have to board there. It would cost $16,000 a year so $8000 each. His father is an alcoholic who hardly does anything with him in the shared care days he has him. I\u2019m a very active parent and we can talk about anything and spend lots of time playing. I have very little money, my ex will not pay child support as he says he is not working. He is self employed, owns 3 properties, big boat, jet skis - has fancy holidays and currently renovating his huge house. I live in a little house which is filled with pets and is relaxed and fun for the kids. I\u2019m rambling on here and this may not be the right reddit forum for this, but my sons education is important to me but I don\u2019t want him boarding just 40 mins from his actual homes for $16,000 a year  just to get into Auckland Grammar. I would see him every second weekend as I understand they are not allowed to come home during the week to stay?? - it\u2019s a very regimented daily schedule. He has a home and his own room and space - his sister goes to Mt Albert Grammar and catches a train there and that\u2019s where I wanted my son to go to. As my ex no longer lives in Mt Albert it is not a given my son will get a place at mt albert Grammar even though his sister goes there so my ex said that he would have to apply to be boarded there also. My ex is a functioning alcoholic who is always angry and has been a bully to me since we divorced 6 years ago. He has a partner who also wants to send my son to Auckland Grammar and board him and together they made this decision with no communication with me. He said he was going to tell me another day ....I\u2019m typing this on my phone at 3am so please forgive any typos. I\u2019m unable to sleep. He would be 13 at the time he would have to board. They grow up so fast I don\u2019t want him gone 5 days a week. When he\u2019s sick I couldn\u2019t be there for him etc etc. does anyone here in the reddit world have experience with how boarding at schools works - pros and cons. I cannot afford $8000 a year either. If I need to post this in a different forum let me know. Thanks in advance for any thoughts or advice.",

            "selftext": "I believe this is the most appropriate subreddit for this? We're having a few house guests staying the week. They have a child. To put things into perspective, that child is a constant screamer, and he screams constantly for no apparent reason whatsoever. He's seven. His parents hardly pay any attention to him, and have spoiled him a fair bit (with video game consoles, tablets, phones, a couple tons of toys...) He keeps whining. Not constant-kid-whining, this guy takes it to a whole new level. I know kids do these things, but he does it constantly, no matter what. Even our people from upstairs can't stand him. My parents can't stand him (A couple of years before I'm legally an adult), my brother can't stand him, and given the hardly-giving-any-attention attitude his parents have towards him, they can't really stand him either. It's bad, sad, and infuriating, all of this. Ironically, his father is a fine, sociable dude, and his mother is on the phone all the time (and when she's not, she's okay as well).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know it's not the kids fault, but holy eff does he drive us insane and drain our energy. And no, trying to talk to him about it isn't effective, he just won't listen. He sometimes has this indifferent, jerk attitude. This isn't some average trouble-maker. If I had a child like that, I'd be ashamed and depressed. Of course I know to be patient (*oh* we've all been patient, but limits do exist).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh, he also hits people when he's angry at them. You know, fists and slaps, his face all red, and I know playful when I see it, I've been around kids myself. This isn't playful. He means those hits. So how can I deal with him? How can we retain our peace, and what advice can I give the rest (except his parents, I obviously don't know what that'll cause) to help us all deal with him? Thank you so much... Reddit is my last resort. Google sucked. This is Hell.",

Brushing his teeth, going to bed, when he wants a snack every 30 minutes he just will not stop crying. I'm desperately trying not to even raise my voice around him since my father was a big believer in slapping the crap out of me to keep me from crying as a child and I don't believe it helped.  I've tried distracting him giving him attention and recently just trying to ignore the tantrums but he will just scream himself sick and I haven't had the heart to leave him for more than 30 minutes as he shows no signs of letting up and just keeps coughing vomiting and screaming. What can I do to ease this? I can't just give in to his every want should I ignore the crying for longer? Idk what to do... ",

            "selftext": "My 2.5 year old daughter has gone to the same daycare since she was 4 months old. Trusting others to basically raise my child is paramount and in my search for daycares, I found myself overwhelmed. My husband and I are both teachers and I have high expectations of myself and others that work with children. For the most part, we have been very satisfied with our daycare. With the exception of some very minor things that annoyed me, the teachers she has had in each room she has been in have seemed to be great at their job and we have loved all of them (as did she). However, she has moved to a new room this year and I am incredibly unhappy with her new teacher. She has horrible people skills and I feel really uncomfortable with her caring for my child all day. My daughter is at an age where she is soaking up so much information , observing everything she sees and modeling what she has learned. The teacher seems constantly annoyed with the kids and is really rude to them (and to me). I have walked in and heard her yelling at them on several occasions, telling them to \u201cget out of my way!\u201d Or \u201cdon\u2019t bother me!\u201d About a week ago, I came to pick up my daughter a little early and she was eating Cheetos. Her afternoon snack was listed as \u201cFresh fruit.\u201d I asked that if she wasn\u2019t going to have fresh fruit, for them to let me know or at least write on her sheet that she had Cheetos. I also requested that they don\u2019t give her Cheetos since they are empty calories and I know she probably doesn\u2019t eat much of what I want her to eat there on her own. The woman was passive aggressive and sent me a nasty email saying \u201cI\u2019m sorry for your misconceptions and jumping to conclusions based on your previous experiences and a bag a Cheetos.\u201d \ud83d\ude44 I resisted the urge to respond and didn\u2019t give her the satisfaction of a reply. Yesterday, my daughter came home and yelled at me to \u201cstop talking, you have a stinky butt.\u201d I was a little horrified because my husband and I have never and would never use that phrase. I assumed she learned that from a child at daycare and had a talk with her about how those are unkind words. She told me that her teacher told her that. I assured her that wasn\u2019t the case but she insisted. Today, when I picked her up from daycare, I told the teacher what Stella had said yesterday and I told her \u201cI don\u2019t think your teacher would say that.\u201d The woman told me that she uses the word butt because she uses real body parts. I told her, I do to (I am a firm believer in teaching the correct names for body parts...labia, penis, etc.)...but that I use the word \u201cbottom\u201d at home. I explained that I teach middle school all day long and while I understand kids will pick things up, I would like to keep my child acting like a 2.5 year old. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s cute to have my daughter yelling that I have a stinky butt. She told me, \u201cbottom is confusing to them. It sounds like the bottom of a table.\u201d She said she uses the word butt and that she couldn\u2019t change the name of it or stop using it. I was shocked to hear her response, especially since I had been polite about it. I just said \u201cwow, really?\u201d And then went directly to the director of the daycare. The director was empathetic, agreed the woman could be a bit abrasive, and said she would have a talk with her. Hours later I am absolutely furious. I pay $1300 a month to send her to a daycare and the woman basically told me, the child\u2019s mother, that I was wrong and she was going to do whatever she wanted despite my request. I\u2019m currently about 5 weeks pregnant, feeling extremely hormonal, and I just can\u2019t figure out if I am getting worked up about something small or how to problem solve. I really wish the woman could be fired. I hate to leave a daycare where my daughter feels comfortable but she isn\u2019t able to move up to the next class until March. And I am dreading taking her there and furious with this woman. As a teacher who talks with parents all the time, I find the way she deals with parents to be completely unprofessional. Parents...am I overreacting? Would this irritate you? How would you expect this situation to be resolved? Thanks for reading...:)",

            "selftext": "By the time a student enters high school, 99% of assignments must be typed. And as students advance to higher grades, their typing assignments become longer and more numerous. This is a great cause of stress for students who are suddenly in a situation where the tools for their learning performance suddenly prove to be sub par. The hunt-and-peck method is irritatingly slow, typos eat up your study time, and you even start to feel that fingers become numb through excessive pecking on the keyboard.\n\n**Training our children to touch type**\n\nTeaching children to touch type the right way has many advantages for their school performance. Touch typing, just like riding your bike and tying your shoelaces, is an explicitly learnt and eventually automatic skill. You can try different typing software such as [Typesy Typing Tutor](https://www.typesy.com/individuals/) , [Typeracer](https://play.typeracer.com/) , and [Typingclub](https://www.typingclub.com/).\n\nOnce you\u2019ve learnt how to do it your brain no longer wastes cognitive energy to perform it. When you\u2019re touch typing the process is automatic, unconscious. You touch type without thinking where a key lies, your finger traces it without you having to hunt for it. This saves you time by eliminating the looking up and down at your keyboard, but also touch typing doesn\u2019t mess up your focus. You\u2019re touch typing your thoughts automatically so you\u2019re able to focus on the thoughts, their accuracy and quality (rather than being consumed with worry and flustered because you keep hitting the \u201cW\u201d instead of the \u201cQ\u201d).\n\nThat\u2019s one of the most important benefits that trained touch typists enjoy, in fact. By freeing up their brain, they are gaining an advantage because their cognitive energy can be focused on more important, high-order thinking tasks that ultimately improve academic performance. ",

            "selftext": "I'm not a parent but I don't know where else to put it. I'm 17 yo and a big brother for 2 sisters of 10 and 14 and my little brother of 4. Although we do have have  few fights with the bigger sister, we get along great. She comes to me for homework, advice etc. And we can just talk about whatever it's great. My little brother feels like my son, I play with him, I listen to his endless ramblings and when he doesn't behave and needs punishment he listens to whatever punishment I give him. I don't want to make it seem like I do most of the raising, my parents are great and I've come at the age where I'm able to see the surface of how much effort into us. They're amazing.\n\nBut we do have troubles with the 10yo. She demands so much attention, gets and acts jealous when she doesn't get it. Taunts her little brother (I guess that's normal so I'll leave that aside) and doesn't listen to whatever we say, whether it's me or my parents. This is really showing with her grades which is why I'm worried and thus posting this. Her grades are edging and obviously needs help. But she is lazy, lies to us constantly that she doesn't have assignments even though she does, refuses to work and always throws a fit when we tell her she needs to. When we do get to work together on her homework (if we leave her alone she won't do anything or barely anything) she doesn't listen to what we tell she should do. When I'm helping her with her math homework she doesn't listen to what I'm saying. I say she should A and she throws a fit and says she should Z. After going back and forth a bit I let her do it her we so she can understand why it's wrong. She doesn't find the answer and still insists it should be Z. She is unbelievable stubborn and I don't know what I should do. She is incredibly tiring throughout the day by trying to get attention, picking fights with the others, bad behaviour as if she's a teen rebelling, and drains every drop of energy when making her homework. Her grades are bad and I honestly fear her going into HS because as it stands she won't survive it there. Mind we give her loads of compliments whenever she does get good grades.\n\nTL;DR: little sister is incredibly stubborn and doesn't listen to whatever I or my parents say. Any advice on how I as a brother can handle it, or maybe how my parents should?",

Ex \"holy moly, not crap\".\n\nI didn't really have parents or an example of good parenting going up. I was nothing more than a punching bag and servant to my family. I don't want to be like the obviously. I try to talk to my daughter but she just yells at me. I'm so worried I've ruined her somehow already. \n\nAnyone have any help?",

We are at the stage now that we a) need to register for elementary school: private or public, b) are thinking of a 3rd kid, c) understand that our time in this apartment is limited d) the list goes on...\n\nOne of the biggest things we have found we are missing here is a real sense of community. We have tried parents groups, language groups, religious groups and still haven\u2019t found a community that we were hoping to find. We have a handful of really great friends here, who are long timers of SF and have mirrored the same sentiment. \n\nAnd now with my questions: if you had the opportunity to live in another state, town, district, would you move? We have a few factors to keep in mind (good schools, access to international airports, weather, etc). Are there places better and more friendly/welcoming and community focused than the Bay Area? Where would you move/ where have you moved to? And why that location? \n\n\n\n\n",

            "selftext": "Hi,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(tl;dr option at bottom)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\------------\n\nNote about me:\n\n I am on the ASD, although when I was younger, the spectrum didn't really exist as far as I understood. I was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome.  I also suffer fro the typical side stuff, AD(-H)D, some anxiety, depression probably unrelated to my autism. I was raised without medications, social workers, or aides. I did not have an IEP, don't even think they were a thing. I was held back a year after Kindergarten due to not grasping anything I learned. I also started a year later due to my birthday, this put me 2 years older than the other kids in my classes going forward. I lived with a single parent, who worked a double shift, mostly parented myself and somehow made it out with a great career and a cherished life, after expected ups and downs. I consider myself lucky to have done so with my issues with social interactions and scattered brain.\n\n\\------------\n\nOnto my post:\n\n  \nThis might be long winded, and I apologize. This is my first time posting on this sub reddit and I am grateful for any help and insight on ways to help me understand and get past these numerous issues.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am a father of four children. Three of the children are biologically mine, one is a step son. The step son is 8, he has ASD, but around the age of 5, he adapted with the help of his IEP at school, and while he has some ticks and doesn't get along with my son, who also has ASD, he is for the most part \"an average kid\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have a 7 year old and 6 year old from my prior marriage. The fourth child is a girl, she is just under a year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI split with my ex when my boys were younger, roughly ages 3 and 4. For a year and a half I was far away, but I still had them for a decent chunk per year. After that time, I moved to a city away from them. This post is about my 6 year old boy, who was struggling in school before I got here. A year after I got here, I got him and his brother to live with me full time. They see their mother ever other weekend.\n\nMy 6 year old son, from this point on will be AP on this post, has been diagnosed with ASD. Shares a lot of my traits, but also stuff I do not have. He has extreme anxiety, greater than anything I have ever experienced. He has extreme attention issues. He was diagnosed with disruptive disorder, etc, etc. He does terrible in school.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe year overlap with me here, while he lived with his mother (First Grade), was worse than the year prior when I was away (Kindergarten). The worst things he did in these years was run away from the school (left school grounds and went into town) and nearly got suspended by the principal. He screams at his teachers, refuses to do work. Fights with other kids, verbally, and fell behind in all subjects, especially reading.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe summer he moved in with me, he started second grade (this year) and his reading level was still at a Kindergarten level. Part of the reasons he moved in with me is because, I felt powerless before, but also, I am a strict parent. My psychologist told me that part of this is because of my own ASD, and how people with ASD who have programmed themselves against certain behaviors, find it more abhorrent when they see others who have ASD who act out. Part of it is also not being able to understand how something that is now clear for you, is not clear to them. I was a bit skeptical about this being the reason, but I see it between my son, and my step son, who both have ASD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs stated, AP now goes to a school near me, starting second grade this year. Unlike his mother's house, we do extreme punishments here and in part, we feel we have to, because the way he justifies consequences. Extreme punishments are losing access to everything he considers fun. We are at the worst of it now, with him sitting for many hours, either doing school work, reading a book, or nothing at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs a quick note about his living situation. He shares a room with his younger brother (age 5). He has chores and an allowance per week. He lives a very structured life, with routines. He has a set bedtime. He eats 3 meals a day in a family setting. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt school this year, he started off with the same ole acts with his prior school. Yelling at his teachers, etc. We got on this promptly with taking things away from him for a week straight. He went back to school, apologized to all his teachers he yelled at. We haven't seen this behavior return. We thought, maybe we are getting somewhere. We know with his mom, the punishments for this kind of behavior were lite. The way he thinks is, OK, if I do this thing to avoid work, like yelling at my teacher, I might lose my Nintendo DS, or whatever, but I will have my other things. We found, any fun activities negates the entire punishment - which is why we must resort to taking everything away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven though this worked for some things, like the yelling. Other things propped up. He started touching other students, sometimes very strange (I won't go into details, but things that could be considered sexual), pushing kids in lines, lying for stupid stuff that isn't worth lying about, and so forth. He just recently got caught stealing food from a girl at lunch, when she wasn't looking. Kids in his class call him a bully. Fact about him, he weights like 43 pounds for a 6 year old. He would fall over if you blew on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor some of these things, we have punished him, but for some of these, punishments aren't working. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOutside of school behavior, other things about him include sometimes lack of apathy, although he does show it at times so its there, somewhere in him. He has a hidden anger/temper issue, where he justifies a lot of his actions because \"he was very angry\". He is the poster child for the saying \"Doesn't think before doing\". He can be morbid - saying some weird stuff that a little boy his age probably shouldn't be saying, but, i am not a doctor. He is an amazing actor, he can cry on demand, and stop on demand. If he knows you are weak to such things, he will remember that and is smart enough to know how to manipulate certain people who he can get to feel bad for him. Likewise, if he knows it won't work on you, he won't do that stuff. The list goes on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor those who might be wondering, have you tried anything else? We have. Of course, we talk to him and try to understand why he does these things from his own words. He is mostly, dead silent. He will sit there and stare at you, and when we ask him \"Well, do you have an answer?\" he says \"I am thinking.\" This will go on forever until you just give up waiting. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have given him chances on many of his behavioral issues when he does then. Often we do a 3 strike rule, and he without fail, will strike out regardless of the impending punishment.  When we get a report from school on his behavior it is a 50/50 chance he will be super honest, or he will lie, there does not seem to be a rhyme or reason for either. He appears to know\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have sent him last year to a special program in town that deals with autism and behavior issues, but this did not help.  He has seem social workers, psychiatrists, and psychologists, he has seen all the aides and specialist the schools have to offer. We have used everything we can that we have access to here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want to say, yes, he is doing better here. His reading comp has gone up and he is starting to catch up. He is excelling at math, but some of these behaviors, the pushing, the stealing, and so forth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am hoping there is someone out there reading this that has had this experience and can give me some insights on this. I can also answer any questions I may have missed here to help fill in any gaps left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\----\n\nTLDR\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy 6 year old son who is on the ASD is getting better in some areas, academically, but in social areas, declining. He is pushing other kids at school, stealing, lying, and can't seem to answer as to why he is doing these things. At a loss what to do. Have tried all the specialist options in my city and nothing has worked. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

            "selftext": "If you've not yet experienced the dreaded chickenpox, stay cautious (also remember that chickenpox can occur more than once!)  \n\n\nI hope some of you may be interested in reading about some home remedies, outside of the famous Oatmeal bath...  \n\n\n[https://healthnotepad.com/chickenpox-home-remedies-and-solutions/](https://healthnotepad.com/chickenpox-home-remedies-and-solutions/)   \n\n\n### Calamine lotion:\n\nIt is likely that calamine lotion will become your best friend during chickenpox. This is because it is proven to help to soothe and reduce itching. This is because it contains zinc oxide which will help to soothe the skin.\n\nThis is available in both a lotion and a cream; however, the lotion might be more natural to apply, especially if the spots are hurting them. To use this effectively, you should use a clean finger or a cotton pad, and dab the lotion onto their skin. Please note though that this is not suitable for use on spots around their eyes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n### Honey:\n\nAlthough this might sound rather odd, honey is an excellent remedy for chicken pox. This is because it has both moisturising and antibacterial properties that are great at helping to heal the blisters and soothe any soreness or itching that your child is suffering with.\n\nTo use, just apply a thin layer of honey over all of the affected areas, and leave on for fifteen minutes, or a maximum of thirty minutes, before rinsing off with lukewarm water. Do not rub.\n\nDo remember that this might not be the most appropriate remedy for children under the age of one, as they should not have honey. If you choose to, ensure that they are supervised at all times, to ensure that they do not ingest any.",

I want to be as supportive as I can, but I have no idea where to start. He's only 10, and already all he wants to do is fit in. I feel like 'just being there' isn't enough. Everyday I force him to go to school, telling him that 'maybe today will be better' when in reality it only gets worse. From my time in school I remember that there's always this 'one child' that doesn't get along with everyone else, it's heartbreaking to think that he is that person. I've tried speaking to his teachers, and even the parents of the other children, nothing seems to be helping. I don't want him to 'fit in' or anything just to be happy with who he is, and to not get beaten up everyday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny advice is appreciated. ",

She is normally a very level headed, strong young woman. She has never been prone to overly emotional outbursts. These crying episodes are slightly worrying to me. I know they are hormonal; but they are so out of character for her that I am at a loss.\n\nPlease reassure me with your stories of adolescence, yours or your children\u2019s.\n\nI should mention my concern is because I have a couple of mental illnesses, bipolar II, depression, ADHD.

I cant wait for her to be like that and be more interactive. \n\nI went to my doctor and she put me on a anti depressant. Its been a month. It could be working, not sure.

As long as it\u2019s not illegal or dangerous... if an adult tells you to do something (teacher, boss, grandparent) JUST DO IT. Kids are babied nowadays and get away with murder. My son walked into work early one morning and just barely clocked in when they told him to go clean up pee. He did his job and didn\u2019t back talk. I\u2019m not saying my kids listen every time someone tells them to do something, but they respect adults and do as they\u2019re asked. Don\u2019t raise your kids letting them think they are the boss. They need to learn respect, not just to their elders or a boss but to people their own age. ",

He gets really obsessed with random topics (right now he is really interested in coin collecting. Previous interests have been: carrier pigeons, exotic animals, population control methods including but not limited to genocide, chemistry in general, physics, diseases) He refuses to do anything his peers are interested in. He won't play Fortnite (says it's too violent) or Minecraft, or any video games. He won't read fiction (but he will read textbooks, manuals, dictionaries and encyclopedias.) He does like music, but mostly pop music like Ariana Grande and Taylor Swift. I don't care what he likes, I think he's cool, but according to my nephew(8) my son is going to get picked on for liking \"girl music.\" \n\nHe has this annoying habit of assuming everyone either knows everything he knows and/or wants to talk about his interests. They never do, but he doesn't pick up social cues.  He used to love going out to the park and playing with other kids, but he's been rejected so many times that he doesn't want to go anywhere lately and I think he's developing social anxiety. He is Autistic, and he has verbal tics. \n\nI've been toying with the idea lately of hiring a babysitter/mother's helper to come over and play with him, just so that he can have positive interactions with someone who isn't me. I really don't know what to do, but it breaks my heart to see him so lonely. ",

            "selftext": "This is a throwaway account as I hope for privacy... \n\nI am a mom to a 12 year old boy.  For some background, his father \\(my husband\\) died in a car accident when I was 4 months pregnant. He was raised by me alone, with the help of my parents until I met someone when he was 6 and remarried.  I now have two other boys, 4 and 1 with my second husband and am currently expecting twins.\n\nOver a year ago, we were told by family friends that their daughter \\(8\\) confessed to them that she and my then 10 yo had been touching inappropriately. This led to us finding out this was happening with other kids \\(my sons step cousins\\) and led to us basically being kicked out of our community. We moved to a different state for my son to see a highly regarded child/family psychologist \\(fearing the worst, that he was a predator and had been molested by an adult\\).  After almost a year of therapy, the psychologist told us that he thought everything was worked through, an adult had NOT been involved, he was not a predator, and all behaviors fell into the 'normal range of experimentation' and he no longer needed to see the psychologist. We talked a lot with him about boundaries, acceptable vs unacceptable behavior, and did an exhaustive sex ed curriculum with him.  We were relieved because we thought that we handled it. We later chose to move back to our home state \\(not near where all of the other kids live \\- 5 hour drive away\\).  \n\n2018 begins, he is in a great new school, doing ok grade\\-wise, wonderful church, has friends, plays sports, etc. I thought everything was great. Then last week I get a call from the school principal that he has been drawing pornographic graffiti on the bathroom walls since January. It has gotten progressively more disturbing \\(highly accurate description\\) since January and he was suspended for the remainder of the week along with being required to help the janitor after school for a week when he returned.  We were completely ok with this consequence. For punishment at home, he was no longer allowed to leave the house unsupervised and I removed all of the books from his bedroom. \\(He has no access to the internet, or devices because pornography was revealed as being a problem in his therapy last year. He can browse amazon on our family computer while supervised, or watch the youtube videos he likes on our big tv in the living room while we are there.\\) Media is highly monitored \\(tv, movies, etc\\) for the same reasons. When we talked through what had happened at school he was calm and could communicate with us.  He isn't violent or angry and doesn't shout at us or anything like that. \n\nThat night, we woke up and found him in a mentally altered state covered in vomit and urine. His eyes wouldn't dialate, he wouldn't follow any directions and struggled with my husband who was trying to keep him from hurting himself further. We called the ambulance and he was transported to the hospital and treated for 'toxic exposure' \\(read: overdose\\). Later he admitted to taking a handful of Ibuprofen \\(we found the bottle in his room, fortunately not empty, otherwise he would probably be dead.\\) It was one of the scariest things I have ever experienced as a parent.  The craziest thing is there was no warning of this at all. I had been in his room that night at bedtime and talked with him, and he seemed fine. \n\nWe don't know what to do with him. We are afraid that the psychologist was wrong and there is a lot more going on with him that we know about.  We have our suspicions about a family member that had access to him when he was preschool age.  We fear for the safety of the little kids in our home.  We moved heaven and earth to get him the help he needed last year but we just can not move again \\(financially the last year\\+ has been very draining\\) and I am going to have twins in a couple of months. It all seems like too much right now.  He met with the school mental health person \\(not licensed and almost $300/hour\\). This is not a feasible cost for us to maintain for the long term, and we make too much money to qualify for their low income discounts.\n\nI am sending him to live with his grandparents \\(my inlaws from my first marriage\\) for the summer, which takes the pressure off for now. They have offered to take him for the school year too, but they haven't had to deal with him yet and I don't know if that offer will stand after this summer. I never thought I would have to send my child away, for any reason. I feel like a failure as a parent.",

Her mind doesn't seem ready, but ..this is happening.  \n\nShe woke up crying this morning.  The reason was frivolous, but I can tell she is deeply depressed and heartbroken.  \n\nI've arranged for her to see a therapist.  I told the doc, \"It's not about me, whatever she needs to cope and I just don't know enough.\" \n\nI'm afraid of going over board with attention while not being certain how when to push her into action, like making sure she doesn't isolate but also giving her time to heal.  \n\nI just don't know!  I'm so heartbroken to see my baby girl like this.  \n\nDoes anyone have any good resources to read on the internet?  I cannot afford to buy books.  I have a good friend who might buy me one if it comes to it, tho.  Important stuff.  \n\nI know this is reddit, but will procede with discernment.  I just need some ideas that resonate with sense and I can take it from there.  \n\nNote: The entire family is somewhat depressed as we are financially oppressed and constantly face futility.

It's their name\n\n- While there's a certain level of respect that you should get by default of being someone's parent you still need to work to keep it (i.e. your actions are what earn/keep respect, not your title)\n\n- Children would still know who their parents are, especially if you tell them and the respect would still be there. I mean, look at the workplace, in the jobs I've worked you were not required to call anyone sir/madam, but you still knew who was boss even though everyone addressed everyone by first name or nickname\n\n- Using your first name, lets your kid see you as human\n\n- Respect isn't exclusively shown by what name people call you (although, in a lot of cases it can be). Tone of voice and actions matter too. So a child could hate/disrespect you and still call you mom/dad\n\n- Using first names could make you closer. I think it would break down the 'us and them' dynamic between parent and child, not completely but may go some way to doing that\n\nWhere do you stand on this?",

After much begging she asked me to record a YouTube clip of her doing a \"challenge\".. This was published today and outside of the 9 family views no one has watched it.\n\nShe keeps asking me every ten minutes how many people have watched her video and it kills me each time to reply with the same number. She's now asked if she is a nice person as no one is watching her video. \n\nCan you do me a favour on father's day and give this a watch? It's only 34 seconds and would make her day!! \n\nThanks!! \n\nhttps://youtu.be/78LXOS3SCmc\n\nTldr; my daughter made a clip on YouTube, now thinks no one likes her because no one watched it. ",

Do parents think they are accurate? How much do you think you pay each month for the food, doctors copays, toys, and clothing? What are some expenses that aren't covered that I should know about? Also, I imagine a second kid is less than the first in some ways, but maybe not.\nFor us personally some of the costs they include in the calculator are covered regardless of whether we have a kid. For example, we would buy a house regardless of child status, have two cars regardless, and health insurance that we pay for costs the same if you just have your spouse on it or up to 5 kids. Still, all you hear about is how much kids cost, so I'm curious as to what I'm missing. When you subtract out housing, transportation, and healthcare, the cost is only like $300/month which seems quiet low.\nAlso if this has been covered elsewhere I apologize, I didn't see it.",

            "selftext": "I feel so guilty for feeling so aggravated. This has been going on for months and months. Tonight was especially stressful.  I was exhausted from the anxiety of arguing with my spouse earlier in the day as well as from running errands the rest of the day with my two young children. It was dinner time and my patience was spent. Spouse worked late and I was solo during dinner and bath time with the kids, already feeling low energy and high anxiety. While I was in the midst of cooking dinner I asked my naked, just-out-of-bath 6 year-old to run upstairs to room and grab underwear and pajamas. 6 year-old resisted adamantly and I flew into a full-blown rage. I don't hit my children and I try really hard not to yell, but I was screaming and posturing myself over child in I'm-the-boss-so-don't-effing-mess-with-me-mode, gritting my teeth with obvious rage in my voice and on my face, commanding child to go upstairs (NOW!) and get dressed for dinner. Child resisted, telling me how scared he felt. I felt myself boiling. Why was I so angry? I'm so sick of walking up there with him. I'm mad he got his sibling out of the tub to go upstairs with him. I'm in the middle of cooking dinner after jugggling everything else all day with no break. We have been through this routine so many times and I've validated this kid's feelings over and over and over and then talked about thinking vs feeling brain and the concept of feeling fears and doing it anyway. I've empathized with him, shared my own fears and how I've been scared and had to push through fears with practice. I've walked up there to check things out for him. I've told him I would never send him into another room if I thought it was unsafe. I've tried to patiently encourage him countless times. I've asked countless times what I can do to help him feel safe, what can I do to help him face his fear of what he says is \"that a creature will get me.\" I've taken him to a play therapist. I've asked him to describe and draw the creature he's imagining. He says he knows it's not real, but his imagination is strong. I get that. I relate to feeling that way as a kid, but my parents never tried anything to help me. Nothing I or my spouse have done to try to help our son has helped sustainably. It is so damn frustrating. I'm so sick of dealing with it because it is not realistic for me to go with him into another room in EVERY SINGLE scenario. It's draining. Sometimes I wonder if he's doing this for attention. Well, tonight in my rage I grabbed him and with his arms and legs flailing and him screaming and crying and me screaming at the tops of my lungs (for which I'm really embarrassed and ashamed) I forcefully carried him upstairs against his will and planted him in his room with the lights on and screamed at him as I scanned every nook and cranny of the room, \"Look! No creatures here! Nothing here! Nothing here or here! There's NOTHING in here that can hurt you!\" Through sobs he grabbed his underwear and pajamas and put them on and I felt like the world's biggest asshole. My three year-old who had followed us upstairs instantly came up to me with a hug and was like, \"Its ok. I'm sorry you're so mad. I still love you.\" That made me feel like even more of an asshole; my kids are more emotionally intelligent than I. I calmed down and apologized but I recognize that that was probably traumatic for my kids. I hate that I did that. I wish I could've been better at giving up control and just relaxing. Who gives a damn if dinner is a few min later because I have to help my son get his PJs? We ate later anyway because I freaked out. I reeeeeally wish I would've reacted differently, and I also reeeeeeeally want to not have to shadow my son every damn time I need him to go get dressed or go to another room. If you have some constructive ideas that might help him and/or me be more patient with him, I ask if you'd be willing to share them here. Thanks. ",

            "selftext": "Hello!\n\nI'm a 15 year old kid who wrote an essay about corporal punishment because I'm so fed up with stories about abuse and punishment and this and that and blah blah blah. I hope that you all read this and learn something from it. Sometimes, valuable input can be gained from the most unusual places. I hope my essay will make a difference for some parents. Please don't plagiarize! Thank you so much and have a wonderful year!\n\nI also don't mean to offend anyone as these are my thoughts and opinions. This is by no means formal.\n\nBig thank you to u/deepcleansingguffaw for informing me about posting!\n\n----------\n\nNew Year, New Disciplinary Methods\n\r\nAs we may know about our world, it may sound usual for parents to punish their children for doing \u201cbad\u201d things. The word bad being used loosely as it is defined by who and what shapes our moral conscience that leads us to punish our children. This type of corporal punishment is known throughout the world as something that teaches children consequences of good and bad doings. It\u2019s quite simple, actually, if you look at it from a psychological standpoint. Doing \u201cgood\u201d makes the parents award the child and doing \u201cbad\u201d causes parents to hit the child, therefore training and conditioning the mind of said child into thinking this. It might be ingrained in our culture but it doesn\u2019t mean it has to stay that way.\n\r\nResearch has shown a significant decrease in child responsiveness to the parent with additional psychological and mental problems, along with behavioral and logical disabilities when corporal punishment is used (Psychological Bulletin 2002, Vol. 128, No. 4, 539 \u2013 579). The \u201cfear\u201d tactic makes children afraid to anger their parents which cause the child to shy away from them.\n\r\nThe parents, on the other hand, may think that what they\u2019re doing is best for their child. Or they may pull the \u201cthis-was-how-I-grew-up\u201d card on you when asked about their disciplinary measures. If this is the case, then the parent must be educated with facts leading to what the ultimate solution is: stopping corporal punishment. Yes, this may have worked for them and yes, this may have worked for those before them but times are changing. New methods are currently being put to practice which have yielded positive results as compared to previous ones.\r\nOne of the reasons for this argument is that they might feel that their child is becoming too \u201cattached to their gadgets\u201d. One question I have for people like this is: why? Why do you feel that technological advancement is causing young minds to expire? These advancements have allowed us to reach new levels of information we haven\u2019t reached before. Do not blame the technology, blame yourself. Imagine if everything bad that has happened to your children was caused by technology. Don\u2019t you think that by doing that, governments would have stopped using it by now? That they have banned it from reaching their citizens?\n\r\nAnother thing to consider is anger management. Since corporal punishment has been commonly used in history as a mask for abuse purposes, it has quite a dark past. Parents might have had parents with anger management issues, leading to them thinking that it\u2019s okay for them to do it as well, effectively passing this trait on to the next generation and to the next, until it throws itself into a never ending cycle of physical and psychological pain for those involved. One solution for this is for the parent to stop making excuses for their actions or by sugar-coating it in a way that sounds totally reasonable.\n\r\nOne other solution to this (and yes, this deserves another paragraph) is by simply trying to understand your child. A country cannot function if it\u2019s leaders do not understand their citizens and vice versa, the same way that a family cannot function if one party does not try to understand the other. Corporal punishment is a barrier between the two because the parent lashes out at the child which in turn causes the child to misunderstand the parent, and this becomes another cycle in it\u2019s own right.\n\r\nAll I\u2019m saying is, we need to find another way to discipline our children without the need to hit them. It would serve our world and more importantly: the next generation better by teaching them that violence isn\u2019t the way to go. If you have read this far, then you must be truly invested in this. I would like to thank you for reading this short essay on corporal punishment. This is by no means formal and just a way of releasing emotions and thoughts into a string of words.\n\r\nThank you and have a good day.\r\n\n",

Some backstory:\n\nMy wife and I have been married 11 years, we have 5 children (all between us, no former lovers). A son (9), twin daughters (6), then 2 more single daughters (4 and 2).\n\nWe are pretty friendly and very loving towards one another. But lately my wife and I have just had enough. Instead of being understanding and considerate we are immediately grumpy and annoyed.\n\nTo be fair, its an insane roller coaster having 5 kids and throwing twins in the mix exacerbates anything.\n\nAnd I am conscious of it, but damn... Its like getting kicked in the shin in the same spot time after time after time...\n\nMy wife and I need a change. We need a course of action. Any suggestions?\n\nTo further avoid confusion this problem is between my children and us. Not between my wife and I. Sorry for my incoherence.\n\nThe kids just wont listen. Wont \"remember\" to do daily chores. Tattle and instigate.",

Nudism isnt a sexual thing in our house. \n\nI would never be nude around anyone with out their permission, especially children. But I would not want to hide being a nudist from my kid's friend's family, in case one of my other kids were to be seen nude or my wife or myself were to be accidentally seen. \n\n II think transparency in this is very important and I believe this would also help from having their kid come home and tell them we are nudists and they think were doing something sketchy and illegal. If you would like more info on nudism before answering check out r/nudism.\n\nWould you still allow your child to be friends with my kids? \nEdit: Should i even bring it up? Or is it something you would like to know?\n\n\nThanks!\n\nEDIT: cleared up stuff that confused my questions and a word",

The larger issue is that he keeps getting diaper rash flare-ups that I am convinced would be reduced without diapers.  \n\nHe HATES the potty, will protest loudly after more than 5 seconds.  We have a really good understanding on most issues, so I don't want to pull authority on him.  I know that he responds best to mimicry, trying to be a \"big boy\"- he is constantly copying me with typical guy stuff (I am the dad) like renovations, car repairs, etc.  So I let him watch me pee, and have even peed into his potty.  I am now convinced that he thinks that it's what only grownups do, he needs examples from peers closer to his age.\n\nNo siblings or peers nearby, so I'm hoping to find a youtube video, but all I can find are targeted to the parent in \"how to\" format.  I can't seem to find a single video that portrays it in story format, in a fun, easy to understand and relate to.  \n\nSuggestions please?  Even another subreddit to ask this question in?",

            "selftext": "This is a serious question from one w/out kids.  If there is a better subreddit for this (except legal, this is not a legal ???) that non-parents are allowed to post in, please do direct me in order that I can get some guidance.\n\nMy SO and I are a middle-aged, long-term couple that until recently had a very private back yard.  We live in a legal cannabis state (WA).  So we frequently toke up with our big old bongs and joints out in the backyard *which is the only place the law allows*.  I love nothing better than to take a joint out with me to my large garden and putter around. AND, my SO is fond of nude sunbathing from time to time.\n\nWith the construction of this treehouse, which is situated right up against my garden, with a window that will give these kids a great birds eye view of our entire back yard - well, you can see where this is going.  If we continue to live our lives as we have been, these kids are going to get an education on dabbing oils, taking monster rips from huge bongs, and exactly how big a dick an Asian man can have (HUGE).\n\nOnto my question: after much internet research, it appears that treehouses overlooking other private property are pretty common. I read dozens of articles about conflicts between treehouse building people and the neighbors who feel invaded by the prying eyes of kids. The glaring omission from the parents is this:\n\nI could not find ONE article that hinted that parents EVER think about the possible negative consequences of giving kids a bird's eye view of your neighbors.  I am pretty blow away at the tunnel vision view that everything that goes on in people's private back yards is hunky dory for kids. Do you not remember how exciting it was to be snooping on the activities of adults? \n\nA related question: I SURE these kids have smart phones. What recourse do we have against kids taking photos of us in the back yard and posting them to the internet?\n\nInput is appreciated, but I'll be honest at the outset: ANY suggestion that we should curtail activities that we've engaged in for years in private because my neighbors constructed an elevated portal to our lives won't be taken seriously.\n\nShould we DO anything?  I am leaning towards: \"well, these kids are gonna get an education in sex and drugs if nothing else.\"\n\nSo what would YOU do if you built a treehouse for your kids only to discover it ended up teaching them about dab rigs and huge bong rips?",

It is a vacation that puts you in Florida or LA but no where near the beach, where all entertainment is scripted and carefully marketed with an eye towards building lifetime customers and selling accessories. It is a vacation nearly guaranteed to cost double your budget, with easy access to credit-funded up sells at every turn. \n\nI will take my kids to National Parks, the beach, a new city, state or country. I'll take them canoeing, biking, skiing, hiking, or otherwise adventuring. I will even take them to an amusement park for a day.

            "selftext": "We have a 3.9 year old and a baby, and I've been torn on the whole screen time thing. Due to our general parenting philosophy and personalities, we are trying to create as few rules as possible in our house. Every time I try to imagine a scheme for controlling usage of screens, it quickly starts to seem absurd or too finely-grained and gets in the way of spontaneous learning and sharing/teaching. For example, if I limit him to 1 hour per day, but I want to show him something great I found, does that cut into his hour? What if I need to do more than one hour of work or reading on my computer; isn't that hypocritical? Can't we just demonstrate and encourage balance and good old contextual, independent thinking by the way we structure the rest of our lives?\n\nRecently, I read a couple of opinion articles that support the direction I'm leaning.\n\n[Why I don\u2019t limit screen-time for my kids - Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/parenting/wp/2015/05/18/why-i-dont-limit-screen-time-for-my-kids/)\n\n[Don't Limit Your Teen's Screen Time - NYT](http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2015/07/16/is-internet-addiction-a-health-threat-for-teenagers/dont-limit-your-teens-screen-time)\n\nThe articles are more about older kids, but already I've just been not worrying about it as much. Our screen usage is still permission-based where I enter a code on the iPad or allow him to turn on the TV, but the 3.9yo can binge a little and watch video after video after video about wooden train sets and Legos. He also voluntarily spends hours of self-directed time playing with his actual wooden trains and Legos. Sometimes things in the videos inspire him to do things with the real ones. I found a great early math/number-sense game (DragonBox Numbers) and a few other good iPad games, using [commonsense.org](https://www.commonsensemedia.org/), so the quality of his options is pretty high. He still watches a lot of dumb (to an adult) song/animation videos, too, but that is a side effect of deciding to back off somewhat in this department. Sometimes Mama and Daddy complain that the video he is watching is annoying and boring and we find something better. Sometimes I just tell him to take a break and put the iPad back on the charger and he forgets it exists for another several hours.\n\nWe read plenty of books, we get outside, we visit cousins and family often, we do art, we buy groceries, we eat dinner together without devices, he helps me cook, we have a bedtime routine, we talk about feelings, we have gentle but firm discipline, we hug a lot, all that stuff. And the 3.9yo surprises me frequently with his conscientiousness and empathy. I think if I mostly get out of the way, set a good example, and provide the kids with opportunities, they'll turn into fine people. Is there anything inherently wrong with unlimited screen time, or is it just associated with other negative things at this point?\n\n---\n\nHi, by the way. I've been subscribed for years and checked back sporadically and enjoyed some good articles but don't think I've ever posted here.",

I got the mouth wash the same flavor as the last one she was using. The inly difference is that barbie is on this one. So she throws this huge tantrum and refuse to use either one. The toothpaste because she doesn't like mint and the mouth wash because she doesn't like the barbie on the package. I told her she didn't have an opinion and to brush her teeth. She refused once again. I don't want to have this battle every morning  and every night. How can i get this little girl to willingly brush her teeth?",

            "selftext": "My husband (38M) and I (37F) live in a two bedroom condo that we own (paid off).  We have lived in condos/apartments of various sizes together for over 10 years.  The one we live in now is about 1200 sq. feet.  When we first got together, I really wasn't interested in kids, but we both have had a change of heart recently after being together for 13 years.  Lots of my friends (who live in different cities) have kids, but for the most part I know very little about children.  I'll poll my friends for their thoughts as well, but just wanted to reach out to a wider audience to see if anyone has tried the condo life with kids for any period of time.\n\nI would like to stay in the condo as long as possible (I guess I'm weird?) but the hubs really wants to move into a small house in the suburbs.  I'm not particularly against it, but I know a house would be a lot more work and likely will cost more, even taking into account the HOA fees we pay now.  Factors in favor of staying at the condo include 1) very affordable 2) amenities such as a front desk, dedicated receiving person for packages, pool, hot tub, gym and 3) only one or two neighbors on our floor.  On the other hand, our condo building is in an industrial neighborhood with no family friendly businesses within walking distance, so except for hanging out at the pool, we would have to take the car to go to parks or to be able to play outside.  Most of the people in our building are either retired or young and single/childless.  So as far as family-friendly community, there is none in the building that I know of.\n\nSo my question is, how long can you live with a kid in a 2 bedroom condo?  Is it impractical to drive every day to a park?  What if you're picking up the kid from the day care/sitter at the end of the day on weekdays and will have them in the car anyway? How important is it to have other families in the community where you live? \n\nThank you!\n\n*edit* Thank you everyone for the amazing responses! I definitely can see the pluses and minuses of staying in the condo versus moving to a little house in a more family friendly neighborhood. It is most likely we'll stick around for the first year or two and see how we feel after that.",

My husband and I both have siblings and divorced grandparents, so the Christmas ends up being several different celebrations with an excess of gifts. The current norm in our family is that everyone gives a gift to everyone else. \n\nSince we are hosting at our house this year, I would feel perfectly comfortable suggesting a different mode of gift-giving, for example a \"Secret Santa\" type exchange of one gift for each adult, but I know everyone will still want to give a gift to my daughter.\n\nI am looking to reduce the focus on gifts not just because we don't need much, but also because I want to be careful what expectations and values we are setting in our daughter.\n\nInterested to hear from others who have pondered such changes in family traditions, and what you suggest. Thanks!",

            "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI'm 27M and for a long time have considered having kids but not getting married or even being in a long term relationship.\n\nI know this might sound really stupid, but what are your thoughts on intentionally raising a child in a single family home? I think I'd be a really great dad who genuinely cares and will not stop until he's done a good job. I will in a couple of years have a stable job that pays $300k+ so I'm not worried about providing financially or hiring help when needed. Does this only take you so far?\n\nWhat would you say is the biggest difference between 2 parent homes and 1 parent homes?\n\nI would really appreciate it if you all provided serious answers. I'm at a point in life where I need to start figuring this out. If I get an overwhelming number of people telling me that intentionally raising a child in a single parent home is stupid, then obviously I may need to reconsider.\n\nThank you in advance for your constructive criticism.\n\nEdit:Thank you all for your responses so far.  I appreciate the diversity of responses/questions/anecdotes. You all bring up different aspects to this situation that I have not given enough consideration to.  Thank you, and I'm looking forward to hearing more! \n\nEdit2: Thanks for all the feedback on this thread. And thank you for all the PMs with stories, concerns, and support. I didn't make this clear earlier, but this is something I'm considered doing 4-5 years from now when hopefully I'll be able to make a very informed decision.  I wanted to particularly thank /u/MrsWhovian for introducing me to the idea of co-parenting.  If I don't end up meeting someone that I feel like I would want to have kids with, I'd probably go the co-parenting route over doing it solo.  ",

The problem is my son use to be really clean and took tons of time on his personal appearance and hygiene. I've recently started to notice a foul smell coming from his room, his blankets and sheets, his clothes, ....him! I make him shower every day with the exception of some Saturdays. I do his laundry so I know his clothes are clean. The only thing I can think of is he's not washing himself like he should or using enough deodorant. I have tried to talk to him and he gets really embarrassed and completely shuts me out. Any ways I can get him to start taking better care of himself? Tips on how to address the issue without embarrassing him further? Help me please. ",

Both my sister and her fianc\u00e9 work long hours and very busy people. \nThe 4 year old started school this year and has been getting in trouble. Everyday he comes home with conduct marks, only has gotten a star probably no more than 20 times this entire school year so far. He has stolen class mates sweaters and brought them home saying they are his.\nMy nephew has developed a bad habit of saying no and cursing very badly at people, of course I assume he overheard it from his parents. He breaks everything.  He almost set the house on fire, he got paper and put it in a candle then put it in a car board box and just stared at it. Luckily my sister smelled it and got it out of the house just in time but he didn't get in trouble.\nHe draws all over their walls. He pretty much does most of his defiant actions when no one is looking and once he gets caught he doesn't get punished.\nMy 4 year old nephew can be extremely bad at times but instead of getting disciplined he gets away with doing bad things. My mom says it's because my sister is a young mom, and I see how she is always on her phone and isn't very good at keeping an eye on her children. \nMy sister hardly ever disciplines him. The fianc\u00e9 tries to discipline him but since it isn't his kid my sister gets very defensive about anything he does.\n\nI think things would possibly be different if my sister actually watched her kids and was more involved with them. But I'm not a parent and she has two kids. I really have no idea what it's like being in her shoes. \nWhat do you guys think?",

            "selftext": "My Husband is a Christian, though he doesn't go to church or say grace or pray... To be frank, he is a Christian in name only it seems most of the time. I am an Atheist. We don't have children yet, but will be trying in the next year or so. He wants to send our kid to a Christian Private school, I would feel better sending them to a regular private school. Here are our views below.\n\n&gt; Husband went to a Christian private school in grade school and some of middle school. He says those were his favorite times in school. He then went to public school and hated it, ended up being there for an extra year. He doesn't want our kid to go to public school.\n\nMe\n&gt;I had a poor experience in a Catholic Sunday school where I was no longer able to attend for asking to many questions. I do understand there is a difference between Catholic and Christians, but  in either case, religion is a bit of a tough one for me to swallow. I also went to public school and graduated a year early, as did my sister. I do agree with him on sending them to a private school though.\n\nMy big concern with sending our kid to a Chrisitian private school is solely because of the religious aspect to it. I don't want our kid to be picked on for asking questions, or that their mother doesn't believe what they are teaching, as far as it being about God actually existing. I always respect those who believe but I had also believed I would want my kid to make the decision later on in life, when they are old enough to make the choice him or herself. \n\nI don't know if I am over reacting to this or what. What are your opinions on this? Are there any atheist or agnostic parents who sent their kids to a Christian private school? What was the outcome?",

            "selftext": "I'm 29 and have a new born son who's almost 3 months old. My SO is about 4 years older than me. I'm a first time dad. \n\nMy SO was the one who was more anxious about having a baby. Me, I knew I'd want kids some day and could've waited longer, but we decided on a time that was a sort of compromise that we can both live with. Everything went well and she got pregnant on the first try, and we have a healthy son.\n\nI'm kind of struggling with the whole being a dad thing. Don't get me wrong, the kid is beautiful and cute, and I am a pretty involved dad - changing diapers, bottle feeding, playing, putting him to bed, etc. But, I feel like being a dad is a chore and is not as fulfilling as it seems it is for my SO.\n\nI'm working + studying 5 days a week, and when I get home I feel like there's never going to be another minute I'll have to myself. He obviously needs constant care, and even though my SO is doing a great job and really, I can't complain - here I am complaining.\n\nI feel like I don't have any time for friends, barely enough time to keep up with school + work, and zero time for myself. Every moment I have at home is mostly spent taking care of the baby or doing chores related to either baby stuff (cleaning bottles, boiling water, etc.) or basic cleaning/tidying. \n\nAt moment I kind of feel like my life is over, but I try not to think about it like that and just take each day at a time. \n\nI just wanted to vent and maybe ask how other dads are coping. I also feel guilty at times or anxious that maybe I'm not cut out to being a dad? I've heard it's normal but I don't really know, it seems like other dads I've heard of or seen are much more into it, and they talk about their children with fulfilment that I'm just not getting. \n\nAny thoughts or advice would be appreciated.

His parents, grandmother, cousin, sister, 5 year old neice and 10 year old son live there. The nurse before discharge told us it is RSV season and to limit visitors. I feel like taking our newborn over there is exposing her to too many people, particularly small school age children that carry a lot of germs. He thinks I'm being unreasonable because my best friend is coming to visit tomorrow and in his words \"oh its OK for your family to see her, but when it's mine it's different\". My question is am I being unreasonable? Are his feelings justified?\nEdit: typos\nEdit 2: thanks for your insight, reassurance, and anecdotes. I was sticking to my guns about her not going over there but feeling guilty. After hearing other parent's experiences I know I'm doing the right thing for my little lady.  ",

I\u2019m a parent of a 2 going on 3 year old, and heaven help me this is a good cross between a vent and a plea for help/guidance/solidarity because I\u2019m not alone/suggestions. I have a fantastic, polite, sociable child. Has been for the better part of the past 2 to 2.5 years. We did a lot of attachment parenting and such. Seemed to work. And, somewhere around July of this year, it all went to shit. We chalked it up to the fact that we\u2019d just taken her on a 14 hour road trip to visit family for 2 weeks, and then 14 hours back. And then we got a dog, and chalked it up to adjusting to essentially having a sibling in the house. And then she started homeschool preschool and things got sort of better\u2026I imagine because she was challenged during the day. And then they went to shit again. We have been very schedule, routine, consistency driven her entire life. She knows the expectations of the house and usually does well to listen to them. But, as of late, it feels like nothing but defiance. And part of me says, she 2\u2026 does she really know how to be defiant at this age? But, I don\u2019t know how else to explain it. Simple things. Stupid things. Like saying she\u2019s hungry for lunch and lunch time, and giving her the choice between 2 foods and she picks option A, and as we\u2019re paring it she opts for option B. When we say no, and tell her she can have option B tomorrow but today it\u2019s A because that\u2019s what she picked, she melts down. If she doesn\u2019t melt down and accepts option A, she takes 1 bite and then gets up and decides she\u2019s done. \u2026I wish this was a rare occurrence. We finally stopped fighting her on food, if she got down and walked away then so be it, but there were no second chances to eat and she went without anything else until the next meal. \u2026no change in her refusal to eat. She knows she\u2019s not allowed to throw sand at the dog, or to chase the dog around the house, or to clap in the dogs face\u2026and yet\u2026she does it. We take the dog out to go potty and play fetch with the dog, and she decides she wants to play. And finds a stick. And throws it at the dogs face. I admit that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s intentional and her aim just sucks. But\u2026we\u2019ve told her that she doesn\u2019t get to throw sticks for the dog, only balls and only when someone lets her so we can make sure she\u2019s pointed in the right direction\u2026and yet\u2026she fucking does it. We\u2019ve tried taking away tv time, ipod time, sending her to her room, making her sit in time out on a stool in the hall with nothing around her. She probably needs more things that are her centric to do, time that is just hers to run and play\u2026 but that\u2019s sometimes easier said than done. In the summer it\u2019s not bad because there are school play grounds. But, once school has started the playgrounds she enjoys and challenge her are off limits. The city ones leave much to be desired. She responds well to \u201ctime in\u2019s,\u201d which is realizing the negative behavior is just a request for attention and time devoted to her. And, will try to keep an eye out for a stretch of about 20 minutes where our daughter hasn\u2019t been being mischievous and awful in order to give her a time in (so as to not directly reward negative behavior), but those 20 minute stretches are becoming hard to come by. I don\u2019t want to just take her to the playground, or into the city to the museum or zoo or some awesome playground a half hour away, all to reward the crap behavior. We made the mistake/genius doing of spanking her with a wooden spoon when she would shove the chair into the dog. That has since stopped\u2026and she seems to fear being spanked with a wooden spoon. But, neither of us want to resort to continuous hitting/spanking/whatever to get her to listen. We were both spanked in our day, and I\u2019m not against it. But, I think that it has its time and place, and for every little thing isn\u2019t it. Likewise, with the absolute frustration and anger we sometimes feel with her when she\u2019s acting this way, I would hate in a moment of those emotions to bring it past a spanking to a beating because heaven knows that is not how either of us were parented or want to parent. I that part of this is just the 2\u2019s and 3\u2019s that everyone warned us about. She\u2019s still polite to strangers, and pretty great when we\u2019re out of the house. But at home she is in fully \u201ctest my limits,\u201d mode. We obviously don\u2019t attempt to cave, but when she doesn\u2019t get the message it feels like we\u2019re caving. Supposedly it gets better around 4 to 5, but do I really want to wait it out for the next year or 2 all to find out we\u2019ve been doing it wrong and now instead of having a toddler testing the limits I have a spoiled brat of a child? It feels like we\u2019re losing control in our house. Not that we give in, but that at every. Single. Turn. She seems to be having a meltdown about something, anything, nothing. If we are home, she will try to change her mind and go against what we say just to see what happens. To get a reaction. To test her limits. Because she hasn\u2019t been diagnosed with something yet. I don\u2019t know. I have zero idea why. And whenever we ask her why, she can\u2019t seem to answer. I gather why is a big concept for such a little person, and to tell us that she\u2019s testing her limits or to get our attention is something I certainly don\u2019t expect her to know. I am stay at home mom, so it\u2019s not like she doesn\u2019t have a parent around. Friends she\u2019s lacking in. Maybe she\u2019s starting to realize that. Our little oasis (I use that term so super loosely) in western Pennsylvania is pretty sheltered. We came from western Massachusetts where there was a different free community play group going on each day during the winter. There were ways she could go play with peers in a safe environment. That\u2019s not offered here. Not only are there just no indoor play places where we\u2019re at, but there are no community centers, no play groups, no anything targeted towards kids unless it\u2019s a structured music class, structured dance class, structured something. Even our local Y is lacking. We tried putting her in preschool there while I worked there. I quit because I didn\u2019t feel safe with our daughter in that program (that I was working in and saw). I know she\u2019s to the age she NEEDS peer interaction. But, it seems so silly to put her into daycare when I am a stay at home mom. Maybe we need a break from one another during the week. Maybe she needs peers. Maybe it\u2019s the age. Maybe we\u2019ve just done something royally wrong. I don\u2019t know. I have zero idea. But, I do know I need something to change. We both need something to change. Is this just a normal part of the terrible 2\u2019s and the threenager stage? It\u2019s our first kid and we only moved here a year ago so we don\u2019t have much for friends with kids we can ask. Is there a better way to handle it? We spend so much time fighting with her, and yelling, and sending her to her room\u2026 this isn\u2019t how a family should be. We were both raised in slightly dysfunctional families, we want something better for our own. She seems to do relatively okay when she is with just 1 parent, but when we\u2019re both around her\u2026 the dynamics change so much. If she\u2019s already had a bad day with me, when my husband gets home and she has 2 of us, the day goes from bad to explosive. I don\u2019t know how to regain some semblance of enjoyable family time\u2026for any of us. I, who have spent YEARS working with kids, and YEARS dreaming of being a mom will end my days ready to throw in the towel and be done. More than once I\u2019ve cried herself to sleep and told my husband that I just can\u2019t do this anymore. It\u2019s probably venting, but I shouldn\u2019t have to end my day ready to give up. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m not experienced with kids and didn\u2019t have a basic idea of what it means to have kids. Granted if you don\u2019t have your own, it\u2019s a different story to be able to leave them at the end of the night instead of having them with you 24/7\u2026 but it wasn\u2019t like I\u2019d never seen \u201cother side,\u201d to having kids instead of just a seemingly happy family.\n\n\nThank you\n\n\ntl;dr Positive parenting doesnt seem to work any more. Our 2.5 yr old daughter is a princess while out of the house but a demon at home. She won't listen, melts down at everything, and is turning into a brat. We don't know what to do any more.

            "selftext": "I've been thinking about this for a while, and when I saw the \"Daughter lives in LALA land\" post, it triggered me to finally write this.\n\nWhen I fill up the dishwasher, I don't do it because \"it needs doing\".  I do it because I want to minimize my work later.  I know that if I leave it, noone else will do it, the food will become hardened, and so increase my work when I finally have to do it.\n\nBut when you ask the kids to do the dishwasher, what is their motivation?  Pretty much only to not be told off, which isn't all that much of a motivator.\n\nI saw a video of a father complaining that the chores for the kids included, say, wiping down the table.  But again the only motivation for the kids is to just not be told off.\n\nSo I've been thinking about how to change this.\n\nFor example, the children have to put their dishes in the dish washer, but if they don't then they have to wash the dishes by hand before they eat.\n\nSo that you're not telling them off at all, but just letting them deal with natural consequences.\n\nI think that for things like hoovering, you can try to \"tie\" it in with some other activity.\nFor example, the carpet has to be clean before they watch TV.  So you don't ever tell them off for not hoovering, but simply not allow them to watch TV if they don't hoover.  It would mean needing to hoover yourself though if they decide that they just don't want to watch TV...  (But personally I'd consider that a win).\n\nWhat are you thoughts?  Can you think of other examples along these lines?\n\nOne thing that I saw one parent do was to blame the clock.  \"Oh, I'd love to read you more stories, but look at the clock - it's your bedtime, sorry.\" etc. \n\n",

She's a gifted child (in the gifted program at school, whiz at math, scored the highest score in the county for the state writing assessment, etc) but she literally has no attention to detail.  She just doesn't think through her actions.  For example, I'll ask her to put the clothes in the dryer and wake up the next morning to find she never bothered to turn the dryer on.  I'll teach her how to load up the dishwasher just to find my instructions completely forgotten the next time she does it.  This just happened, my son is sick, so I asked her to fill the humidifier and put it in my room so it would start humidifying the room for when he goes to sleep...I go in a few minutes later and notice the humidifier isn't on...so I tell her to turn it on.  Then she leaves the door open, so the humidifier is humidifying the whole house.  Other examples are like, she'll have a field trip, but not even think about finding out what time they are leaving, and I end up calling around asking other parents.  Or she'll get invited to a birthday party in a week, and she'll completely forget to ask me until the night of, after we should have RSVP'ed, etc.\n\nI love her to death, but I find myself shaking my head wondering if I was ever so thoughtless when it came to the stuff I did.  I'm just wondering if this kind of thoughtless meandering through life is normal for a 13 year old.  It's almost like if I don't give literal step by step instructions on EXACTLY what to do in a given situation, she just has no idea.  To be clear, I trust my daughter, and she's always on point when it really counts...Maybe I'm expecting too much for a 13 year old?  Maybe it's just a personality difference, because I have always shown a lot of attention to detail (maybe to a fault).  Does anyone else have really smart kids that you notice being really spacey?  Any tricks to help her keep her thoughts on what she's doing?  Am I worrying about it too much?  Because the thought has crossed my mind lately that I really don't know how she's gonna survive if I'm not here telling her exactly what to do/how to do it.",

Often I see what I perceive to be very unfair discipline between the children him and I have together and her children from another marriage.  Her children seem to get off the hook rather often while my children take the brunt of the punishments. This past punishment was for my middle son, who is 9. He forgot a spelling assignment at school. Their idea of a punishment was to take the entire family out to dinner and not allow him to partake in the meal. Instead he had to watch his brother and sister, as well as, his step siblings enjoy the meal. He was fed one peanut butter and jelly sandwich with milk before they went to the restaurant. Then to add insult to injury, they proceeded to go and get ice cream, of which again, he had to watch everyone enjoy. His older brother, at this point, was feeling so sorry for him that he said he was full and didn't want any ice cream. He was told that he needed to get ice cream anyways because his brother needed to learn a lesson. As my middle guys mother, my heart is ripped in two and I am furious. Do you think I am out of line in thinking that this rests on the line of cruelty and abuse? I think the situation could have been handled a hell of a lot differently and probably would have been more effective. Instead my son once again had to feel ostracized and humiliated by people who are entrusted to help him become a contributing member of society.",

Is my kid going to emulate me?  Not a quality I admire.\n\n* Can't admit when I'm wrong.  Will my kid think I'm infallible, or a jerk?\n\n* I get quickly frustrated and angry when others contradict me / fail to capitulate to my arguments.  I tend to yell when I get to a certain point.  Yelling to kids is bad, right?  I don't want my kid to have anger issues.\n\n* I constantly put others down.  It's the way I grew up I guess.  I can't help it, and most of the time I don't even realize I'm doing it.  I just think I'm joking around having a good time, then out of nowhere someone starts crying, and I'm like, wtf?  My wife is a saint for staying with me.  I don't know how she does it.  I try to keep it in check, but it subconsciously bubbles up and I don't even notice it.  I don't want my kid to grow up to think less of others.\n\n* I procrastinate a lot and fail to take things seriously.  I don't want to set a terrible example for my kid.\n\nI probably sound pretty messed up.  I grew up in an, err.. aggressive, environment.  My dad would hit my mom, my mom would hit my older sister, she would hit my older brother, he would hit me, I would hit my younger sister, and having no one further down the chain, she would kick the dog.  I don't plan on spanking at all, but my wife is not so sure yet.\n\nIs there hope for me?\n",

I watch a 7 year old little girl and a 5 year old little boy. Their father is out on deployment and their mother is just a stay at home mom. However, she is always gone. (I think she may be out with a different man every week, but that is none of my concern.) My concern is these children. They swear, kick and hit my son and I, pull their pants off and just sit on the couch naked. And the other day I caught the little girl taking a drink of Vodka. (Not kidding.) As much as I'd like to quit, I can't. Too many have sitters have came and gone because of this and I don't  want to let them down. They pay is good and I really do want to help these kids. I'm not too sure on how to get their mother to see it. She always just brushes it off and laughs when I try to tell her how they behave. Any ideas?",

However, i was talking to a girlfriend of mine and she says she doesnt let her kids watch the show. Her argument is that it's too violent, and that it's a teenager/young adult show. Now she happens to be more conservative and a practicing christian woman. Is her argument based off her religious views or is adventure time not a good show for kids? ",

You can include as much or as little detail as you want - I don't need identifying details like your last name or the name of the daycare. There are 15 initial questions\n\nExample Questions: How many hours per day does your child spend in daycare?\n\nDo you think your baby enjoys his/her experiences in the child care setting? (What convinced you?)\n\nWhat would you like the program to do for your child?\n\nPlease help me, the only people I know with children in this age range do not use child care facilities!\n\nEdit: I have sent out the interviews! Everyone in this thread is my favorite! May the paths you walk be forever free of Legos!\n\nEdit again:\n\nI wish I could give you all gold, but I'm a college student so the best I can give you is something free.

He's been with me for a couple of months, but words goes round at school and a lot of kids treat him differently for his background (mother's a junkie). \n\n\nHe's weird when it comes to feelings. He says people are on a scale of 3 to him. People he loves, as in 'I love him with all of my heart', neutral, as in he doesn't care about the person at all, does not have any opinion on them and 'I hate this person with all of me' and he goes out of his way to express his hatred towards those kids, because they treat him a certain way. I'm trying to get him to loosen up on things, but it's hard. He's set on how he feels towards people. It's either extremely hot or cold. \n\nHe says he doesn't want anyone he hates at his party, but he says he knows the other kids will feel left out and pick on him more if he doesn't invite them and the kids that do come will be weird about the others not being there.\n\nI told him it's fine if he makes a small gathering and just invites a few friends, maybe explains why he couldn't invite everyone. I can say I initiated it or something. Maybe not mention he's having a party at all. It really seems to be frustrating him because I can tell he wants to do something but he doesn't know what. \n\nEDIT: He's 7.",

She's frequently said that it's fair that way.\n\nShe's very independent and asocial (except with family), so anything along the lines of 'being nice makes other kids happy' falls flat.\n\nParents, whether or not your kids had Asperger's or any social problems, how did you handle this?",

            "selftext": "I posted this earlier in /r/parenting:\n\nTL;DR - my daughter's ninth birthday is in three weeks. At a playdate today, she got into a fight with a friend (that's mostly the friend's fault) and now she doesn't want the friend at her party. When my wife told her she couldn't just exclude her that way, she said she's not gonna have the party at all if she has to invite that one friend.\n\nLong version:\n\nMy wife and I have one nine-year-old daughter - let's call her C. C's birthday is in 3 weeks, and she's having a party that's going to have about 40 kids (20 from her 20-student class, 10 cousins/family friends, 10 friends from activities outside of school). She gave out invitations to the kids outside her class a few days ago, and this Monday she's going to hand the rest out at school.\n\nYesterday, C was at a friend's house on a playdate - let's call the friend P. C and P watched Frozen for the umpteenth time and had a difference of opinion on a plot point. They talked back and forth about it and both were getting annoyed the other wouldn't admit they were right. After so many minutes of this, P started repeating what C was saying in a mocking tone. C said something like 'Stop it - I don't talk that way' to P and P told her not to be upset about it.\n\nAt this point, I should mention that P has a tendency to overreact and get offended at random things at school (think 'annoying childhood friend' from Advice Animals).\n\nMy daughter told P that she's the one who always gets upset at things so she (P) shouldn't be telling her (C) not to get upset at what she (P) said. P told her to apologize for saying that or to leave (all C did was state a well known fact). C sarcastically said 'I'm sorry for pointing out the obvious' then P told her to get out, so C called my wife to pick her up (P's parents didn't know this happening until my wife arrived at their door).\n\nC decided she doesn't want P at her birthday party, which is a problem, because everyone else in her class is being invited, which would mean P would be the only one without an invitation. My wife listened to C's side of the story but told her she can't leave just one kid out, so C had a tantrum and said if P is coming to the party she's not gonna have it and that it's all my wife's fault (for saying she couldn't invite everyone but P).\n\nObviously, it's really cruel to invite everyone but one child, but on the other hand I understand that my daughter doesn't want P at her party.\n\nIt's worth noting that C and P used to be pretty good friends but that C has always found P's habit of overreacting annoying.\n\nAny advice on what to do would be appreciated.\n\nEdit: I should mention C has Asperger's and a sensory processing disorder and is generally terrible with people (nervous/uncomfortable around anyone she doesn't know well and rigidly intolerant of anything/anyone she doesn't like). The whole point of inviting everyone to her birthday party was so that she could have fun with people she didn't necessarily know as well as others in an environment she's comfortable with where the day is all about her.\n\nMore than anything, I want her to still want the party because this is the perfect chance for her to have a chance to have fun around other people.\n\nEdit 2: Thank you everyone for your responses. We've gotten C to agree that P can come if she apologizes to her - otherwise, she's not invited to the party.",

For instance, last night she woke up at 3:00 am and became hysterical until I finally got her back to sleep around 6:15 am. My husband and I both tried desperately to get her to calm down and go to sleep. She would get scared of something and start screaming, crying and being unreasonable. My husband works everyday for two weeks, then gets a weekend off and then works for two weeks, etc. He has to wake up at 5:30am every morning. This is wearing him down and we are at our wits end. He gets really angry which I think makes it worse and harder to put her to sleep. I can handle it a bit more but this has to stop.\nShe can wake up anywhere from 3-9 times a night. She has a routine, we give her milk, we read to her, brush her teeth, let her look at her book(s), put her to bed and I sing for her until she falls asleep (since it relaxes her.)\n\nPlease, any suggestions would be great.",

            "selftext": "at my daughters schools from 8th -10th grade, in PE she attends the swim unit and boys and girls have \nit together? Why is this allowed? Wouldn't this make girls feel uncomfortable \nand give immature boys an opportunity to harass and humiliate girls? And cause \ndistractions and goofing off among everyday? Not to mention young boys will be shirtless around young girls and I think that is inappropriate especially in a school setting \n\nMy daughter keeps saying she does not care but she is young and may not understand how wrong this is \nthis just seems wrong especially at school. Giving a boys a chance to leer at girls like this \n\n\nthis class also pretty much just gives students to look at all the other students in bathing suits. What is this a party or something? How is this appropriate for school? Why is the school providing an avenue for voyeurism? \n\ncan people really say honestly that young boys and girls will concentrate on swimming while they are around each other in bathing suits and not goof off? That boys (who aren't known for sensitivity) won't use this opportunity to harass or tease girls? \n\n\nSchool management should arrange different time table for boys and girls for swimming. Boys and girls can attend same class at the same time to know each other. They also can work in the same group in debate competition, in quiz games. Those things will be enough for boys and girls to know each other. There is no need to arrange swimming in the same pool at the same time. \n\n\nI am shocked that SCHOOL of all places allow this. This is not like a public pool that is voluntary to go to. This is part of school curriculum and they are providing this avenue to look at bathing suit clad students to kids. This is not a public pool that is voluntary to go, this is a school of all places \n\n\nthis seems like a very bold thing for a school to do \n\n\nwhose idea were these classes? These classes only seem to benefit males and it gives them an opportunity in school to leer at their female classmates in bathing suits. Why create a class just for boys to look at girls basically?

            "selftext": "For me, my oldest is almost 4 and doesn't get to watch many movies so he pays *full* attention when the opportunity presents itself.  I love the chance to talk about what he's seen and he doesn't hesitate to ask the tough questions (like \"Why is the wolf faster than the sheep, because they both have 4 legs?\").  Consequently, I have to pay pretty close attention to what I let him watch.\n\nI have a very different opinion than the MPAA about what constitutes questionable content. \n\nStuff where I differ from the MPAA:\n\n* Language - We constantly talk about when words are appropriate.  At least I'll know where he heard it.  \"Poop\" isn't a bad word, but there are places where you shouldn't use it.  \"Ugly\" isn't a bad word, but if you use it to hurt someone's feelings, it's wrong.\n* Death - We've had a few serious talks about death and loss (I highly recommend Charlotte's Web as a conversation starter).  It's a tough topic, but I consider it important.\n* Nudity - Don't care.\n* Drugs/Sex - Haven't had to deal with these yet.\n* Violence - The MPAA will flag a movie for violence against people, but not violence against animated toys or snowmen.  Honestly, I'm more concerned with intent and consequence than whether the target can bleed.  \n* Cruelty/Suffering - My most common problem is when a movie makes makes these things seem funny or positive.  There are a surprising number of movies where we are supposed to laugh at witty teasing or the suffering of a \"bad guy\".   It's okay if a movie has cruelty or sadness, but it shouldn't make the audience happy.  It's okay to cheer when the defiant Supervillain is getting his butt kicked, but I don't want to cheer about how sad he is after his defeat.\n* Your Views - So many movies are lessons these days.  If that movie happens to align completely with my parenting views, that's cool.  It's a risk though, because otherwise I don't want to have to spend time unteaching the views that don't match mine.\n* Blatant Marketing - I won't veto a show for this, but over-marketing to my kid might backfire.\n* Darkness - This one is odd.  There are some concepts that I don't want my kid to grasp.  Kids (and adults) experience such a small portion of the world.  Everything else is extrapolation.  Recently watched Frozen, (**SPOILER AHEAD!**) and I decided that I didn't want my 3 year old to consider a world where someone that apparently loves him might betray and try to kill him.  Yes, I understand that such darkness exists in the real world, but I'd rather raise a kid that is ignorant of it for a while. (**/END SPOILER**)\n* Frenetic cut scenes - For young kids, I don't want a show that has a split screen and cuts scenes every 0.5 seconds.  I'm of the opinion that attention span is at least partially a learned skill/habit.  Plus, that crap gets annoying.\n\nObviously everyone has a different parenting style and different kids.  \nWhat do you look for?",

My parents weren't the best people in the world (http://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1zqt4s/so_ive_decided_to_not_talk_to_my_parents_anymore/[1] ) so I'm trying to go my own way as far as parenting goes. When I think of something I should remember as a parent I jot it down on this list. I would like some help with it from other more experienced parents. \n\nThings to Remember When dealing with kid\n\n1.\tLove and respect them. \n2.\tNever make it personal, the point of criticizing is to break bad habits, not make them feel bad\n3.\tNever for any reason insult them the way you were insulted (if you have to talk about eating habits do so, lock the fridge if you have to, but never call them fatass or anything like that)\n4.\tViolence is lazy and stupid; this family is smart and hard working. We talk about problems. No violence period. \n5.\tRaise voice if you must but no screaming \n6.\tNever confront kid when angry\n7.\tAs with all things in life, listen to reason\n8.\tShow more affection and don\u2019t worry about making the kid \u201csoft\u201d. A world full of smart sensitive people who don\u2019t use violence is a good thing\n9.\tTeach them science but make it interesting and fun. Think Bill Nye not university lecture.\n10.\tDon\u2019t get mad if they aren\u2019t into science. It\u2019s not everyone\u2019s cup of tea\n11.\tDon\u2019t take it personally when the kid gets mad at you. As a parent you will be forced to do some things neither of you like.\n12.\tDon\u2019t be a tyrant or say things like \u201cdo it or I\u2019ll beat the shit out of you\u201d or \u201cmy way or the highway\u201d. The kid might not be able to survive on their own but they are a person with an opinion and rights that should be protected\n13.\tAlways try to make them understand reasonably when you do something before you just do it\n14.\tSometimes you will just have to move forward even when the kid doesn\u2019t like it. You can only reason so much with a child\n15.\tThey have limited experience, sometimes they just can\u2019t see things the way you do\n16.\tThe kid does not owe you anything. As they will probably tell you, they never asked to be born. \n17.\tSpend time with them. Take them to after school stuff. See their plays and projects. They will take it personally if you don\u2019t. You know this cause you took it personally\n18.\tThink of what your dad would do and don\u2019t do that. \n19.\tYou can be your kid\u2019s friend but you both have to know that you are the leader. \n20.\tTeach by example. Don\u2019t preach to the kid about being hard working, self-educated and skeptical; just show him through your own action.\n21.\tTeach kid to use technology responsibly. Once again lead by example.\n22.\tIf you have to scream at, swear at and threaten your kid than you are the one who is fucking up, not them\n23.\tLet the kid have some close friends over but don\u2019t let your house become the hang out spot\n24.\tBeing mad at a baby crying is like being mad at rain or cold. You can be pissed as you want but it doesn\u2019t change anything\n25.\tYou\u2019ve cleaned up a dog\u2019s shit and puke, you\u2019ve cleaned up your own shit and puke, you can clean up your kid\u2019s shit and puke. \n",

How does one keep their kids from behaving badly? How much control does one even have one their behavior at all? Is it possible for a parent to \"roll a one\" and get stuck with a bad kid out of sheer bad luck? \n\nI ask because I had \"developmental problems\" when I was a kid. I was diagnosed with ADD and later depression. I accelerated in school work and reading but emotionally I was far behind the rest of my peers. Part of this may have been the fact that my parents were \"scream at the top of your lungs and if that doesn't work beat them\" kind of people but I still wonder. What if my kid falls in with a bad crowd or just has mental problems they inherited from me?  ",

He had a nasty concussion at the beginning of school and started out slow and behind, and had trouble catching up.  But now with a new grading period starting, it still seems impossible to get him to make sure all his homework is turned in.  That is all I am asking.  And I have taken away the TV, the Xbox, the smartphone, etc.  Any distraction he could have, I have removed, and it is still like pulling teeth.\n\nMiddle kid has never been great in school.  Plenty smart, but doesn't care and has little motivation and even less attention span.  Most punishment, etc. simply doesn't work.  He claims to have turned things in, and they aren't. Constant battle every night to get things done.  Will take 2 hours to complete 20 minutes of homework.  Diagnosed as slight ADD, tried medication and it didn't work.  Did decently well this last grading period but still a struggle to get him to turn stuff in.\n\nYoungest is just a 2nd grader.  Does really well.  But it is a struggle to get him to read at night or do homework.  I think he has learned this from his brothers.\n\nOur next move will be to not allow them to do anything on the weekend, nor go anywhere, nor have anyone over if we don't see that all homework is turned in each Friday.  That is what this has come to.\n\nWe are both college educated (wife is a teacher) and have always stressed that the kids' job is school.  We help with homework, etc.  But we are running out of ideas.  Any thoughts?",

Everybody's nice to each other as they meet weekly to hear an inspirational message relevant to their lives. They network and reach out to make new friends, and donate whatever they have available for the betterment of their community and world. Sounds great, right?\n\nBut what if you don't believe the specifics of a religion?\n\nWhat if you love fellowship but don't believe in a messiah? What if you appreciate the power of singing but don't believe in an afterlife?\n\nI grew up in the church and I wouldn't change it for anything. The problem is, individual results may vary. What worked for me led some people to be very closed-minded as they got older. \n\nSome base their life according the core message of the church, even when it calls for them to refrain from answering important questions for themselves, and they miss out on the true beauty and mystery of nature that conflict with their religion's teachings. \n\nOthers grew to hate the church and its teachings and closed their minds to the wonderful powers of a strong community that promotes positive social change and mental strength, and they're all the poorer for it.\n\nWhat's a father to do? My son looks to me for guidance and I'm not sure how to continue. You don't have to believe that scripture was god-breathed to understand the truth in this: \"So because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I will spit you out of My mouth.\"\n\nIt's not fair of me to take my son to church and entrust his early education to the church, only to remind him afterwards each time that he shouldn't believe everything he hears there, despite what they tell him they know for a certainty and despite my willingness to continue our weekly visits.\n\nHow do I teach my son to balance an open mind with critical thinking skills? The church offers fellowship that I'm unsure I can find anywhere else, but I'm not sure it's worth the subscription cost.\n\nAny other parents dealing or dealt with something similar?",

Monday- Dress your best, Tuesday - dress as your favorite celebrity, Wednesday - each class has a color (Beige for his), Thursday - dress from your favorite country, and friday, wear all black, one of the school colors.\n\nWhen my wife asked him about tuesday, he said \"Britney spears, I need to borrow one of your sports bras.\"\n\nShe was speechless, but he continued to explain that beige was not a good color on him, and that it makes him look bad.  He said he was going to wear Pink, one of the other class' colors.  He is very much into pink, and started a contest with a few boys in their class who could wear the most pink. He is winning.\n\nWe have always been very open about color, and letting him wear what he wants, so we don't care. He is also very confident in his wardrobe, and wears his clothes with pride, which has spared him a lot of the teasing that most of us would have gotten in school.  \n\nIt has gotten to the point that I would think he was gay if I didn't see how much he likes girls.  But this begs the question, \"Are most boys losing their masculinity, or is it just mine?\"  I know a few of the other kids in his class, and their seems to be less \"boy\" about them than what I remember growing up.  \n\nWith other things I can see it is still there, he loves fishing, hunting, playing with nerf guns, and play fighting with his friends.  But has fashion lost the taboo among 10 year olds these days?  ",

            "selftext": "My 5 year old daughter is at the stage where she is trying to sort out whether tooth fairies are real etc. Until now, I haven't really given her a straight answer.\n\nLast night the subject came up, and I decided to treat her as an adult, and be completely open.\n\nI told her that parents pretend to be the tooth fairy, because loosing your teeth can be quite scary, and having a tooth fairy helps kids not to get scared. I told her that even adults make up things in order to cope with being scared, like God because they are scared of death.\n\nShe thought about it for a bit, and said in a scared voice:\n\nHer: \"[Friend's name] told me something..\"\n\nMe: \"It's okay, tell me.\"\n\nHer: \"I don't want to, it's scary. I might get nightmares about it again\" (She's been having a nightmares for the past few days).\n\nMe: \"It's okay, just tell me and we'll laugh about it and talk about something else\".\n\nHer: (after a long pause) \"She said that shooting stars were wishes that put people into graves, and take people out a graves\".\n\n.. She'd been having nightmares about zombies!\n\nMe: \"No darling. Shooting stars are just rocks and stones that fall down and burn up in the atmosphere. I can show you some videos of it if you want. There's no magic. It's just rocks burning. \" Then I went into a story of being younger and camping in the park and watching shooting stars.\n\nWe laughed and talked about something.\n\nOverall I'm very glad that I had the conversation. For adults, believing in magic and fairies might sound romantic and nice, but sometimes the message gets garbled and kids end up being terrified.\n\nI asked her directly if she'd like me to pretend that the tooth fairy etc was real, or whether to just tell her the truth. She told me that she wanted the truth, but she still wanted the tooth fairy money too! And could I next time give her paper money, and not coins..\n\nWe also agreed that she shouldn't tell her friends though about the tooth fairy, because those friends might get scared about their teeth falling out. She said it would be our secret.\n",

My, then, preteen came home bent over in excruciating pain, barely able to walk.\n\nIt turned out that she had a complex tumor on her ovaries. She had laparoscopic surgery to remove it, and of course, to get the pathology report. The tumor was benign.\n\nSo, to see my kid hurting in a similar fashion caused a great deal of concern. It turned out to be something minor.\n\nBut the most important discovery was her iron level. She has gone from low iron levels to anemic. We are quite aware of this. The battle to remind her to take her iron pills has been never-ending.\n\nA result of iron deficiency is a disorder called pica. My daughter has dealt with this for many years. She basically craves non-food items that have the missing mineral in her life, such as paper or chalk. She is also a compulsive ice eater, which is her coping mechanism because of the iron deficiency.\n\nHer iron levels were drastically low, lowest they have ever been. She was on a dangerous path, on her way to blood transfusions and possible organ failure, if not corrected.\n\nThe kid has always come across as lazy at home. When she's out, she is miraculously a favorite at the party. But at home, she's drained and sleeps a lot. She's a vampire once a month, too.\n\nWell, natural consequences win out, again. The attending physician scared the life back in her.\n\nI look forward to see if consistent iron consumption will curve her pica. So far, I can tell that she is taking her iron pills because she has noticeable energy and she is less edgy, and more optimistic. Hallelujah! It's going to be nice to get to know the new girl in my old teen's body.",

            "selftext": "Every 1000 new subscriptions, I used to have a meta thread to talk about the reason for /r/RaisingKids, and give the community a chance to talk about our culture, future or anything else.  We recently broke 5000 subscribers, and I am using that milestone as an excuse to  make changes that I've been thinking about for a long time.  One example being, that this will be the last 'milestone' post for a while because I can now just pin this post to the top, where it will also serve as an introduction to new members of the community.\n\nIf you have an opinion (good or bad) about the recent and upcoming changes or the direction of the community in general, please make a comment below and we can talk about it.\n\nThe Past\n-----------------------\nI created /r/RaisingKids because I often saw posts in /r/Parenting complaining about the proliferation of 'quick' content (primarily pictures of kids).  From the beginning /r/RaisingKids has focused on more in depth articles and content as well as a belief that following rediquette makes for more interesting and pleasant discussions.\n\n\nThe Present / Recent Changes\n-------------------------------\n\n**Wiki**\n\nI've put some work into the wiki.  Please take a look at /r/RaisingKids/wiki, and let me know what you think.  If your account is at least a year old, and has earned 100 karma in /r/RaisingKids you automatically have access to edit the wiki, but if you don't yet qualify and want to edit it, just shoot me a PM and I can give you permission.\n\n**Downvote Arrows &amp; Hover Text**\n\nI've changed the downvote arrows to be faded and a bit smaller, as a subtle reminder to upvote more than you downvote.  I also updated the hover text on upvotes and downvotes to hopefully sound less preachy and be a bit more concise.\n\n**Moderation**\n\nIf you've been around reddit long enough, you'd probably agree that some kind of moderation is necessary to keep a community high quality.  I do not want to have heavy handed censorship.  This would put me in the position of having to make hard decisions about what is not allowed.  I prefer to remove the obvious stuff via moderation, and downvote things that are not good enough for /r/raisingKids.  *Moderation to remove the worst of it, community voting to help with the borderline stuff.*\n\n**Original Content vs. Spam**\n\nQuality Original Content is welcome on a limited basis.  If you contribute to reddit in other ways, you are welcome to submit your own content occasionally.  If you are borderline, the moderators will make a judgement based on the quality of the submission.  For example, I do not like blogs that take 5 paragraphs of navel gazing to get to the point, so submissions like that are more likely to get marked as spam.  A well researched, well written, useful blog post is less likely to get marked as spam.\n\nThe Future\n------------------\n**Weekly Events**\n\nI wanted to have the weekly events handled by a bot, so that they are consistent and on schedule.  I have recently figured out how to use the python Reddit API wrapper (PRAW), so this should be happening soon.  See the wiki for more details.\n\n**User Flair**\n\nWe have a well defined template for user flair (that requires a message to the mods), but interest has been abysmal, so it is obviously time to try something different.  Maybe just open it up to let everyone edit as they wish?  I think it would be cool to have something like [the original Geek Code](http://www.geekcode.com/geek.html) that we define on our wiki.  If anyone wants to help with that, let me know.\n\n**Link Flair** \n\nAnyone want this?  What categories would we have?  Blog.  Scientific Research. I'm not sure if it would be useful.\n\n**CSS** \n\nI plan on using the /r/mindashq theme (or /r/boxed or /r/edurne) to update the CSS (eventually - could be a while).",

She can tolerate most hard cheeses and some other things such as cottage cheese &amp; sour cream once lactase drops have been added. The kids refuse to eat gluten free pasta. The wife isn't mad about rice. The kids can be fussy about new things, especially my youngest: the thing which bothers her the most is lots of visible ingredients mixed together. With the exception of a few tried and tested recipes (spaghetti with ragu, spaghetti carbonara, chicken fried rice) she likes everything to be fairly separate &amp; easily identifiable. If it's not kosher from her point of view, she'll simply refuse to eat.\n\nI love to cook, especially to experiment, but this is really making things difficult. I love for everyone to be able to sit together and eat the same thing. I do all the cooking. Making different dishes for everyone is a PITA and highly unsatisfying - when I do it often I end up not bothering to eat at all myself.\n\nThere is an argument for just giving the kids what they'll eat - especially if they're eating fresh veg etc and getting all the nutrition they need. On the other hand I have the romantic notion that cooking should be part of the culture which enriches kids. In countries with 'real indigenous cuisine' I suspect that kids grow up learning to appreciate lots of fantastic complex dishes. In UK and North America kids grow up learning to eat chicken nuggets. Ugh. I even have 'string cheese' in my fridge now, though it offends my every fibre! (okay yes I'm a bit of a food snob)\n\nHow the hell do I keep everyone happy, get mealtimes back to being enjoyable, and get my cooking mojo back? I'm not looking for Good Housekeeping recipes. What am I looking for then? A different perspective perhaps?\n\nedit: grammar",

It seems like there is room for a good, and or bad, lesson here... but she is three.  How much will it really matter in the long run?

            "selftext": "Somewhat related to the other post about car seats... how do you handle it when you're giving a ride to someone with their kid, or their kid alone... and the child needs a car seat but one is not provided?\n\n\nI was told by a mother of twin infants to not bother buckling the bucket seats for her babies, because they were basically wedged in the back seat of my small car, with my son in the middle seat and her babies on each side seat.  Since she had the car seats, I insisted that we install them because I wouldn't feel comfortable driving, knowing that her babies seats weren't even buckled.  She humored me but I could tell she was annoyed... and then she talked the whole way there about how she thought car seats were a scam and unnecessary.  \n\nI've been asked to give a 1-yr-old a ride before and \"don't bother with a car seat, because you're only going a few blocks\".  I refused.  And since there wasn't a car seat to use, they ended up calling another friend and I watched the little kid just get buckled right into the back seat with a regular seat belt.\n\nMore recently, and this has been coming up a lot and is harder for me to deal with... giving rides to kids who should at least be a booster seat (but are small enough to still fit in my son's 5-point-harness) and they're used to riding with only a seat belt.  I put them in my car, and see that they don't FIT the seat belt.  I don't care if they're 8 or 9 years old... they don't fit my vehicle's seatbelt.  \n\nIf I know this is a possibility that I'll be giving a ride to someone's kid, I've been taking a booster with me, just in case.  But often this happens because it's not the plan.  If my son isn't with me, I've had other kids sit in his seat before, obviously, if it's empty.  But usually he's with me.  He's big for his age.  I've had an 8-yr-old in my car a couple weeks ago, who was smaller than him physically, but riding in just a seat belt (around his waist, since he was too short to be without a booster).  I was actually debating which kid to put in the car seat and decided that my kid's bones were less developed with him being younger, and it's the other kid's parents who clearly let him go without a booster even in their own cars... but I'd feel awful if I was in an accident and somebody's kid was hurt in my car with me driving.  I've never been in an accident and have been driving for 17 years, but I still wear my seatbelt every time I get in the car.",

            "selftext": "I don't know if this is the correct subreddit.  If not, please\ntell me where to repost.  We have an 18yo son, just graduated from HS.\nHe is going far away to college in August.  He has a girlfriend that is\n17, and will be a senior in HS this year.  She is a sweet girl.  \nThey don't really spend much time hanging out at her house.  She comes over, and they\n\"hang out\" in his room - with the door closed.  This has made us very uncomfortable.\nWe really don't know her parents, or to what extent they are aware of the level of the relationship.\nWe have had \"civilized discussions\" about this with him, but have not laid down any hard rules\nabout what is admissible in the house.  This has become a source of friction.  \nSo today, I was taking out all the garbage upstairs, and indirectly, found a used condom\nin his bathroom garbage can.  FREAKING OUT!!  I don't know if we should confront him about this, or\njust play dumb.  I am not a prude, and was a teenage boy myself at one point, and at that age, if a cute girl \nwas willing to have sex w/me, I would not have passed on the offer.  I am glad that they are using a condom, but\nI have a real problem with them \"doing it\" in my house, when I have no clue as to what this girl's parents know about\nthem. I now have visions of her father coming over here one night, and beating the shit out of me.  \nShe also bought him a really expensive birthday present recently ($200 telescope).  I know if we confront him,\nWe will just end up alienating ourselves before he goes to college, and they will probably find somewhere else\nto do it anyways.  On the flip-side, I am worried that he is going away now, and this girl will be spending\nher Senior year \"waiting\" for him, and he will feel stressed-out in college with them being apart.  They both are still \nyoung, and have a whole life ahead.  I can't see this ending well.  HELP!\n",

            "selftext": "My husband is pro-dual working parents and daycare while I love being home with my 16-month old. I just found out I am pregnant with (planned) baby #2 so reality has set in and we are trying to figure out what the best lifestyle will be for our family moving forward. I have been looking for work for work but we can theoretically afford for me to stay home. Regardless, I probably need to do side projects to stay professionally appealing. I do all the cleaning, shopping, yard work other than mowing, etc. and cook most of our meals from scratch using whole foods. We also spend a few days a week with friends, museums, parks, play dates, etc.\n\nI was in my mid-thirties when I had my son and had spent years before then working as an executive on the account side of the marketing world. I got to see how lots of other folks on the client and account side managed the work-life balance. I have also watched friends and family. I grew up with a single mom who had to work long hours putting herself through school when I was a young child and hated it.\n\nFrom what I have seen, raising young infants/children with two parents in demanding jobs is incredibly stressful. Even if you have a housekeeper once a week, you still have to do all the shopping, cooking, laundry, and daily tidying. Plus you have to conform to the daycare schedule, pack/unpack for daycare and deal with frequent sick days. In my line of work you are expected to respond to email constantly and work intense hours on projects. My husband works on startups which are incredibly demanding. I see it being a nightmare. When would I have time to spend with my babies? My son was a high needs baby who I feel has thrived with me being with him 24/7. I can't imagine having another baby and not being home with him/her considering we can afford it and I want to do it.\n\nMy husband grew up in a joint family in India where he was raised my grandparents, aunts and uncles in addition to his parents. His sisters in the US both work full-time and his few friends with kids do too. As an immigrant I think he is more drawn to the mainstream American lifestyle and hasn't seen the harsh reality of what that life is really like. When I mention things like how his niece cried every day for years when being dropped off at daycare he shrugs and thinks that is part of what the American experience is and points to how academically and socially successful she is in high school. \n\nMy husband feels that we'll both be more \"productive\" if we worked full time outside the home. For instance, I have a hard time making calls to contractors/insurance agents during the day and struggle to find time to work on professional development projects in addition to job search stuff. Eventually we'll both need to be prepared to earn good incomes as we live in the pricey Bay Area and want a good education for our children and retirement savings. We'll either have to move from our nice but affordable neighborhood or do private schools towards the end of elementary school because we value education a lot and the schools / older peer groups leave a lot to be desired. He also thinks I spend too much time cooking and socializing, both things I do at times when the baby is awake and I couldn't do anything \"productive\" anyways.\n\nMy solution is to try to have more of a schedule. We already have a loose routine but it's really easy to get behind and put my son to bed later than we could, cutting into time to work on my projects, for instance. If we are 30 - 60 minutes behind the earliest possible bedtime the boy is very fussy and exhausting to deal with. We aren't schedule people but I figure it is worth a try.\n\nWhile I know some parents love working I know many more would love to be home if they could. What have you experienced?\n\nEDIT Fixed some errors",

            "selftext": "So Sydney (4) is very head strong. She has a very hard time listening. I've tried everything I can think of. Tonight, for example, we went to my Aunt and Uncle's Vow Renewal and 25th Wedding Anniversary Party. I tried getting her to take a nap today, she flat out refused for 3 hours, which at that point, it was time to go. We get to the party, and she immediately starts running around, not listening. I got her fed, and surprisingly she sat long enough to do that.\n\nI ended up having to take her in the bathroom twice for talks. When we went outside to get some fresh air, she wouldn't stay out of an opened gate. Later on, she sat down to eat some cake, I ended up having to go on a coloring book run, so I could keep Charmony (almost 2) seated for a while. That held Sydneys interest for about 5 minutes, MAYBE 10, but that's a stretch. She was doing fine with karaoke later. We were saying our goodbyes, and she ran off..again. My mom ended up getting her, and the whole time she was carrying her to the door, she was screaming \"Let me go!!\" repeatedly.\n\nThey took balloons home from the party, they were tied to the diaper bag. Sydney wouldn't stop kicking them to the front seat, so I let them go....World War 3 started. I pulled into a parking lot and told her to get out of my car, that she was walking the rest of the way home (with my mom, I was going to drive about half a block away to the gas station, they were just going to meet me there, so she wasn't walking all the way home). The restaurant was still open, so I ended up getting out of the car with her, because she refused to get out, I made her sit on the curb while I talked to her.\n\nI wouldn't let her get back in the car until she stopped crying and screaming. I just don't know what to do anymore. Any advice is welcome!!",

            "selftext": "Warning: Long background story to start because it is important to the parenting part!\n\nI have two children with my ex-wife - a nearly-5 daughter and a coming-up-on-3 son. The ex and I separated and then divorced not long after my son was born. I met someone special, and remarried. The ex was not nice in the divorce. I had been the working part-time, mostly stay at home dad while she made $150k+ per year at her job. From the moment I left, she started squeezing me financially (I was still taking care of the kids during the day) and she filed for divorce first. She made it a contested divorce despite all my pleas to do things peacefully, mostly because she had all of our money and knew I couldn't afford to truly fight it out. Given the income disparity, I could have legally forced her to pay some of my legal fees, but going that route would have left us both financially wrecked.\n\nSo, I racked up a ton of credit card debt paying for a lawyer, and then  more debt putting some of my living expenses on credit cards as I was working part time and still the primary care-taker for the kids. Long story short, I ended up in a huge financial hole I am only just beginning to be able to *start* to crawl my way out of.\n\nSo I ended up in this place where I was/am stressed because of finances, I'm tired because I am always either working or taking care of the kids, and I realize that for all the sacrifices I've made for my kids the cost has been me just not being there mentally when I'm with them physically. I mean sure I have good days, but too often I retreat into my man-cave (office) and distract myself while leaving them to extended periods of 'self directed play'. I go out there when there's a problem, and make sure nobody hurts themselves but I'm not really *there*. It sucks. I know I need to do a better job, but I struggle a lot with it. Some days my temper with them is really short and I end up yelling which isn't remotely productive and makes everyone unhappy (including me). And this is all exacerbated by my daughter's seeming inability to listen.\n\nShe can hear - trust me I had that checked out. She just either zones out a lot of what I say, or chooses to ignore it. Simple tasks take multiple requests. I might ask her to put her socks and shoes on so we aren't late for school while I get her brother dressed. She says 'okay' and I come back a few minutes later and she's sitting there reading a book. This kind of thing happens all the time. She'll grab her brother in play, I tell her to let him go and she'll hold on and hold on and it takes me 3, 4, 5 requests of increasing volume and 'intensity' to get her to actually let him go. Meanwhile if someone else asks her to do a simple task it gets done almost immediately.\n\nBut she bounces between this state and an overly needy one. Wants me to carry her around the house, help her pull her pants down for potty time, feed her her food as though she isn't capable of doing it herself. I'm trying to foster a sense of independence for her but refusal results in some pretty epic tantrums at the drop of a hat. I've tried talking with her about it, but it doesn't seem to change anything.\n\nWhat kills me is I want to be doing more stuff with her. I love taking them out to the park, and walking through the woods. I want to teach her to play tennis (or any other sport if she has a preference). But these long stretches where she won't listen, or throws tantrums over small things makes it really difficult. Combine that kind of behavior with my fatigue/stress level and it's a bad mixture.\n\nHere's how I am currently dealing with these kinds of episodes:\n- Ignoring requests etc results in either time out or her being sent to her room\n- Inappropriate tantrums are often resolved if I threaten to put her in timeout or her room, but not always. I typically give her some alone time in her room if she gets too worked up so she can calm down and realize I won't engage that behavior\n\nAnyways, I don't know if this actually makes sense or is cohesive, but I'd really love some advice. I want to be a better father. I don't have these same problems with my son. Sure he misbehaves sometimes, but he is overall far better behaved than she is. Parents of Reddit I beseech you: help! :)",

            "selftext": "A statement made by the victim's mother:\n\u201cHuman compassion is not taught by a teacher, a coach or a parent, it is a God-given gift instilled in all of us. You displayed not only a lack of this compassion but a lack of any moral code.\u201d\n\nLet me just say at the start - I have no intention of baiting or whatever. I have complete sympathy for the victim for not only the callousness of how she was initially abused, but also the lack of bystanders (people she knew as friends?!) stepping in to stop it, and how she seems to have been ostrasized by her own community since. \n\nI just think a mentality of 'these things you should already inherently know, no one else should need to teach you' is a big part of the problem. And there is no better time to address it than now. There is no better statement to rebut that mentality than that of the VICTIM'S OWN MOTHER, (for goodness sakes!)\n\nThis attitude does not bear up, for whatever reason you have to believe it whether it be religion or whatever. It's a cop out.\n\nBefore the existance of schooling how were children taught? They were mentored. Apprenticed. They were placed under the supervision of an adult and learned the cues of supposedly appropriate behaviour from that adult.\n\nParents of toddlers should be able to attest to this because of the way toddlers tend mimic their mum and dad's affectations.\n\nThere is an old saying - it takes a community to raise a child. It's not because the child has ADHD. It's because the child learns from the examples the adult around him/her set. Their codes of behaviour. How those individuals with poor behaviour are demonised. Etcetera.\n\nSo what happens now that we have public school systems?\n\nChildren, at the age of 5 or so - an age when they are typically still competing to gain attention (and in some cases still haven't mastered the art of using the toilet) instead of being at an age where they have learned to pay attention to others are chucked in together as if in a zoo.\n\nI'm not dismissing the role of teachers - I have a lot of respect for teachers.\n\nWhat I am pointing out is when you replace a child having to learn their cues from adults with a system that puts a mess of children still at an age where they want attention from others altogether to learn FROM EACH OTHER, you will have an environment where they are not learning how to grow up. You have them in an environment where they are instead competing to get the most attention against other little monsters with the same goal.\n\nAre we really so surprised our children are growing up:\n- to be trolls? People who post truly hateful comments just so to get attention?\n- to be people who use the term 'rape' as a supposedly funny (or at least everyday) term to use to express gaming domination?\n- to be people who go about crying 'SOCIALIST!' for any policy that might be for the common good rather than a personal windfall for themselves?\n- to be people who think any behaviour is excusable when defending or advancing the interests of themselves or their own?\n\nThe worst part of it all is it becomes a self-sustaining system of poor behaviour. If a few get ahead by stepping on others and are not held accountable, the others will soon learn they have to do the same thing just to survive and not be left behind.\n\nCivil behaviour. Morality. These things are not inherent in our make-up. They are things that are LEARNED.\n\nIf teachers, coaches and parents aren't teaching them ... then where are the kids learning their standards of behaviour?\n\nAnswer: from each other.\n\nBe very afraid.",

He has been spoiled by family, and his great eating habits went out the window. When he was younger, he loved everything. Unless it had a really strong taste, like sauerkraut, lemons and pickles. Now he will only eat things that are deep fried, or battered. Things must not touch, or be cooked together. So soup and many other foods he will refuse. \n\nHe's stopped eating almost altogether. His usual favorites, he won't go near them. We just ate pizza for dinner last night. His favorite, but he wouldn't even look at it. Anyone else experiencing this?\n\nI know most kids get picky around this age, but this seems like way more than should be normal. I'm worried because he recently developed the touching rule, and also recently stopped eating his favorite foods. He's so picky, he wont eat certain brands. All chicken must be tyson chicken, and all potatoes must be either mcdonalds or crowns which are little tater tots. \n\nI've talked to his doctor, and the doc says its normal. He's healthy, but I'm going nuts. I just made cheese and crackers, another favorite, but he wont eat it because the cheese is the wrong brand. His grandmother started this trend.\n\n[edit] We've tried the \"if you don't eat, you don't get to play video games\" and eat until you're full, and a whole long list. Nothing seems to work, they only make it worse.\n\nWe've just started this food bingo thing. We all got to pick a bunch of things we wanted on the card, and we all have to try them. Things he hates, things he loves, went on the card. When he fills the card (eats all the food from it) then we will all decide something he can get in exchange for trying new things. He seems super excited about it, he loves charts and things. I'm thinking we can get him to try quite a few things before the newness of it wears off. ",

My wife and I are about to be college graduates, and planned to have another baby shortly after graduation. Well we timed things right, but being that there are no twins in our family histories, we didn't expect to see two in the ultrasound. One baby we could have handled with virtually no extra cost, two.. We will need to buy a new car.\n\nAnyways, I'm excited to see our two newbies, but I'd love to hear any and all tips you folks might give us.

They were never territorial before, but now utter, \"That's mine!\" or \"You can't have that!\" constantly. They also started getting more physical and have been hurting each other (not seriously, but making each other cry). Having twin birthdays and Christmases made December a month of constant presents so that may have contributed to the growing sense of ownership, but the bickering started around age four and a half and hasn't let up. I'm just looking for some insight on whether this is a phase and if it is common for most turning-five-year-old people. Nothing else has really changed; we haven't moved, my husband and I get along well, no friends or family have died or gotten sick. I haven't been around five-year-olds since my sister was that age thirty years ago! They still show kindness to each other and actively call their brother their best friend, but the bickering is worsening and I want to get them back to a good space.",

We need help for when we are out and about.\n\nAt home I have been consistently using redirection and communication and after a month of patient practice he now will play in \"his\" cabinet and with his toys rather than constantly trying to take spices out or get into the garbage. Of course, he still tries to push limits, but it isn't constant. \n\nI would love to hear your tips about how to let him walk and be down in public without wandering away and with holding my hand when necessary. He will hold hands when he needs help, like navigating stairs, but if you try to hold his hands at other times he turns to non-violent resistance and sits down. If I try putting him down at a restaurant say, he insists on wandering. All he wants these days is to be down exploring. Luckily he doesn't show signs of bolting.\n\nI know that a lot of this boils down to time and development, but I'd love to start working on this. I am a believer in socializing kids to know how to behave in public (at appropriate venues) but need to be safe. I want to help him be independent and walk but need to be able to hold his hand.\n\nThanks for your help!!\n\nEDIT It is working!! I have been practicing walking with my son and he is much better about holding hands. I was really surprised about how quickly he gets over sitting when he realizes I am still going to hold his hand. When we are holding hands, I indulge his interest in things we pass if it is safe and not too much of a nuisance to others (yes: window display of stuffed animals, no: escalator) and I have time. When he resists too much, usually because he is very interested in something or tired, I just pick him up. He'll sometimes throw a fit but I explain my rationale for what is happening in simple terms and he usually settles quickly. The process is very sensible, I just lacked confidence in following through. Thank you, Reddit. I get a kick out of walking through the mall holding hands with my baby who isn't even a year old yet. He just loves it too.",

They have what I'd call a very progressive parenting style that I'm having difficulty adapting to, discipline-wise. They don't punish (i.e. time-out), raise their voice or consistently enforce rules/restraints. \n\nI don't see anything particularly wrong with that approach but I feel like it's the reason I don't like being around my nephew lately. He has little respect for the three of us, throws tantrums when he doesn't get his way and generally regards us only as a vessel for delivering the things he wants. I know this is probably typical of his age and I'm not angry at him. I'm frustrated by his parents' unwillingness to establish any authority. \n\nHe's been very pampered (still sleeps with them at night), which I think is why he is *rarely* willing to play by himself. Rather he is in constant need of attention and interaction which affords little time for us to be by ourselves. What we're left with is a child that difficult to manage and whom we cannot take a break from. \n\nLook, I know nothing about kids, but I'm willing to learn. It's been made clear that their approach is not up for discussion, so my question is what can I do to fit in and tolerate my nephew better?\n\nEDIT: He just turned four.",

Recently the children in my class have come up with the idea that it is okay to take their shoes off and run around in the classroom. It all started with one child, who would kick her shoes off when she didn't like something or get her way. Then she started doing it just because she felt like it, then her best friend in the class started doing it, and now half the class thinks it is okay. I have talked to the mother of the child that started it and mom said, \"when she takes her shoes off we just make her put them in the laundry room.\" She offered to be more stern and start telling her daughter to put her shoes back on, so hopefully that will help. Unfortunately, I still don't know what to try with her when I am in the classroom. I have tried the rewarding system (giving stickers, picking out the book for story time, and being able to pick a special toy out of the toy box), but it doesn't work. Can any of you please help me and give me some advice on what to do? Do you have any strategies like work for you and your children with situations like this?\n\n-Thanks :)",

Truth be told I'm afraid I often have work to do in the evenings, and so don't really have the energy to be fully present (answering \"why\" questions x100 is tiring after a long day!!).\n\nAny ideas, suggestions, books to read, links to check would be very much appreciated.

The 4 year old had a rough time of the terrible twos, but her little brother is driving me crazy. He has been up since 6:30 and has been throwing tantrums pretty much nonstop since then. And he's been doing thing for the last couple months. If he isn't asleep he's most likely screaming bloody murder or destroying things. \n\nI remember how bad his sister was, but this is ridiculous, he'll be happy for maybe five or ten minutes. Silent/not screaming for at most 20, then another tantrum. So much screaming. And he won't stop for at least a half hour. How does he even keep that up? Screaming for so long, it's gotta be tiring; but he keeps going. I'm so tired of him and his freak outs. It's affecting everything, we can't go anywhere or do anything because he's just flipping out all the god damned time. His sister keeps trying to calm him down, tell him the fun things we could do.... Currently he's spending a lot of time in timeout. But that won't stop the screaming or app him from hurting himself or destroying the house.\n\nI just don't know how to get him to stop. Ive taken to bribing him with anything, new toys, sweets, anything just to get silence for even a few minutes. Those aren't working anymore. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice? I'm losing my mind.",

            "selftext": "I have a six year old niece who I babysit for frequently, since I'm currently unemployed. I live with my grandparents, and they help me out with my niece as well. My problem is, that no matter what, my niece refuses to clean herself after going number 2 in the bathroom. She has no problem any other time, but just wont if she poops. She'll sit there and call one of my grandparents to clean up for her, and yet they'll do it. Every single time. I've told her, as well as her mom, that she's old enough to clean herself, but she still won't do it.\nMy grandparents spoil her, so that might be part of the cause.\nI was just wondering, is this a normal thing for a six year old? And how do I deal with it? Do I take away some of her more 'adult' privileges (playing on the ipod/computer) if she's just going to keep acting like a baby? Am I wrong for doing that? I'm not sure if this is a problem for her at home, but she sure does it a lot here.\nI and her mother have talked to my grandparents about this problem, but they'll still hand her anything she wants, even if I tell them why she can't have it (for misbehaving, begging, stuff like that). \nWhat can I do?

My wife is a stay at home mom raising her and our 1.5 year old son.\nThe problem: Daughter gets very mad and frustrated about anything she doesn't like or agree with. This morning, for instance, she wanted a bowl of strawberries for breakfast. We knew that would only hurt her stomach that early in the morning and offered her either a pancake or a bowl of cereal. She starts screaming that she wants strawberries and says she hates the other two options. We told her no. So she calls me and my wife nasty names, poopy head, diarrhea peepee ect. We still won't give in so she runs up and hits me in the nuts (not intentionally in the nuts but intentionally hit me). I told her to go to her room, to which she continued to call me names. I go to pick her up and she starts hitting and kicking me even more. When I finally get her to her room and put her on her bed, she springs off of it and wrestles me to get back out of her room. If I am successful in getting her to stay in her room, she kicks the walls, pushs/pulls on the door knob to make loud noises, throws everything off of her bed and empties all toys on the floor. All while screaming that she hates me and my wife.\nWe've tried time outs, spanking, taking things she cares about and nothing seems to work. It's like she's in this destructive trance and can't get out of it. When she finally calms down (could be 15 minutes, could be the next day) she is sobbing and completely worn out.\nI feel so bad and sorry for her because I just want to help her but I don't know what to do. I'm tearing up as I write this because it frustrates me so badly. Can anyone give some advice?",

            "selftext": "Parents of Reddit,\n\nI need some advice. I currently am the step-father to a wonderful 6 year old little boy. I started dating his mother, who is now my wife of almost a year, when he was 18 months old. I've always strived to be the best father figure for him, and my wife and I are always spending a lot of time with him. We read a lot, play games (whether it be board games, learning games on our tablet / PC), ride bikes, and me and him go to Tae Kwon Do together as our special bonding time. He seems to really enjoy it.\n\nBut, for as long as I can remember, he seems to have a little trouble entertaining himself when I'm trying to do some work (I work in Healthcare IT, so I'm always working at random times), or when my wife is trying to do her online school classes. I understand him being 6 years old and having that curious mind, but he just cannot play by himself for even the shortest amount of time. He doesn't play with any of his toys, he doesn't read any of his books, he doesn't do anything in his room, nor does he seem interested in being in there. He just wants to hover over us and watch us or be around us. And, when he gets too underfoot, we send him to his room to play with his things, he'll just sit there in his room and do nothing. Or, he'll find excuses to call Mommy in there for whatever reason. He'll even start crying really loud if Mommy does not come right away.\n\nWe even recently re-did his room. Re-painted, added strips to the wall, bought him an awesome new bunk bed, with a desk under it so he can color, draw, paint, play with legos, etc. But, that did not seem to help.\n\nThis behavior has gotten worse over the past few months, but it just seems he cannot entertain himself at all. Even for an hour while Mommy and I do some work.\n\nSo, this is either not normal behavior, or I'm just over analyzing the situation.\n\nI don't want him to sit around watching TV all the time either. But, it also seems that if it doesn't involve a sort of electronics, then there's nothing to do. Right now, during the summer, he has one hour of electronics time a day.\n\nSo, parents of reddit, what can I do?\n\n**TL;DR Overly Attached 6 y/o. Don't know what to do. Help please.**",

            "selftext": "Our two year old son generally goes to bed okay around 8pm (give or take) and goes right to sleep, but every night for the last few weeks to a month if not more he wakes up between 11pm and 1am calling for me -- \"Daddy, Daddy.. Dada. Dada... Daddy?  Daddy...\" and so forth.  At first I'd jump up and go in there, pat him on the back, but most nights after going in there time and time again I'd just put him in our bed or lay next to his bed while he slept.  It's like he wouldn't sleep unless i was there.\n\nAfter a few nights of this my wife would go in there, but he'd just say \"I want daddy, not you\".  I'm honored and all, but this has gone on for way too long.\n\nSo last night I figured I'd try the ol' ferber and at his usual 11:30pm when he started calling for me I went in, patted him on the back, and left.  He just kept calling my name, but I gave him about 10 minutes and went back in.   Still calling my name after midnight so I gave him 15 minutes and so forth.  By 1:30am and going in there every 10-15 minutes or more he was crying crazily so I ended up just sleeping with him on the couch since it was obvious neither of us were getting any sleep.  Also we have a 5 year old who this also woke-up, so double whammy.\n\nSo any suggestions?  Our son actually has eye surgery on Thursday to hopefully correct his strabismus so I know we'll have some rough nights after that, so maybe it's not worth working on this until next week.  But I'm at my whits end on what to do next. \n",

            "selftext": "We just spent time with family and I am feeling a little apprehensive about what we can expect in the next few years. My son is 5.5 months and the behavior of his 21 month old cousin has me worried. I'd love to get perspective from parents who practice positive parenting / gentle discipline.\n\nMy 21 month old cousin basically spends his time at other folks' houses being tailed by a parent while he leaves a path of destruction...dirty hand prints on windows and white trim ledges, broken doggy door, broken door stopper, etc. He isn't really entertained by toys but likes to explore and see how things work. He is very keen to push limits and pretty much ignores verbal communication about his behavior. The parents don't say \"no\" but they do say things like \"we don't play with x.\"\n\nI expect at home that we will create a safe, toddler proof environment. At the same time, I'll want to take my son out in public. My mom has a wall of windows between the living room and inviting, child-friendly backyard that they get professionally washed. Going into parenting, I expected that with work I could guide my son to not smear the windows in every visit, for instance. \n\nFrom the outside it looks like the 21 month old exhibits the worst behavior when he is over-tired. It also seems like he needs safe, fun activities to play with at my mom's - when I suggested going in on something to keep the kids entertained the parents looked at me hopelessly and said it wouldn't work because the kid likes to explore. I'm thinking something like a sand box and/or water, ride ons, legos, race tracks, play structures, etc. My parents already have a sandy area for their dog to dig in but the parents wouldn't let the boy play there because they didn't want him to clean him up.\n\nIs my mom just going to have to live with smeared windows and broken things throughout the house, or is it reasonable to expect that gentle discipline / positive parenting will be useful in helping my son not behave like a feral animal when we are out in public?  I've seen this behavior in lots of boys under three and it terrifies me...\n\nOn a side note I am doing signs with my son and the 21 month old knows some signs.\n\nEDIT other than the windows, my mon's house is pretty baby proof. She is a clutter free neat freak. She puts a gate up in front of the tv and a shelf she has with crystal. The broken [door stopper](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zeKyrwHqsWw/TkBi-QxdspI/AAAAAAAAAb4/ZO7VsDp5dWM/s1600/ugly+doorstop.jpg) and [pet door](http://retractablescreensrus.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/Pet-Panel.jpg) (plastic stretched out on sides so no longer keeps hot/cold air out) are structural elements of the home.

            "selftext": "My six year old son will only eat processed chicken tenders/nuggets, peanut butter sandwiches, pop tarts, and various types of fruits. He absolutely refuses to eat try anything else. Now, before you jump on me with, \"He only eats that because that's what you give him,\" let me give you a little backstory:\n\nI'm in the military, and I've spent half of his life either out of state or overseas. I was gone during his transition from baby foods to solid, and I didn't have much influence on his diet during those important years of his development. I don't blame my wife, she was doing the best she could raising him alone. When I say he refuses, I mean he clams up, starts crying, and will actually vomit up anything you coerce him to try.\n\nWe've taken him to see three different pediatricians concerning this issue, and all three gave different advice. One said, \"Physically force him to eat it. He'll figure out if he likes it or not.\" Disregarding the psychological damage I might inflict on my son by doing that, he'll automatically psyche himself up to think it's going to taste bad, and he'll immediately spit it out or throw it up if he's made to try it against his will. Another pediatrician suggested, \"Spank him if he doesn't try it. I've got six kids, it's worked on every single one of them--trust me.\" I for one do not condone spanking my son unless it seriously warrants it--trying to get him to try a new food isn't one of those times. Again, I don't want to make dinner time a traumatic affair.\n\nOn that note, I tried making dinner time a fun affair. I cut his food into fun shapes, I've had him help us make dinner on multiple occasions, I've tried to bribe him with toys and rewards. No dice. I've even lied to him and told him pizza would give him Ninja Turtle super strength. He gagged and vomited it all over the carpet, then freaked out.\n\nI was, and still am, under the impression that unless he's mentally ready and willing to try something new, he'll develop some unfortunate Pavlovian conditioning to fear whatever it is we're making him try. He recoils whenever he sees a box of pizza... But how do I make him WANT to try something new?\n\nWhich brings me to what I felt was a last resort, which was blessed off by the last pediatrician he saw: Preparing the same meals for him that my wife and I are eating, and if he doesn't eat it, then he just won't eat.  Worked on me as a child, and the concept of, \"No human will starve themselves to death with food sitting in front of them,\" seems sound. We tried this, and my son refused to eat a thing, holding out for three solid days before breaking down and trying something new. I ensured he was hydrated and taking vitamins, but the emotional toll it took on my wife and her mother was too much to bear. I don't blame them, seeing a 4 or 5 year old acting lethargic and depressed, with sunken in eyes because he hasn't eaten in two or three days makes you want to cry. It feels like child abuse, even though the kid is inflicting it upon himself. The food he broke down for and ate was oatmeal, and he'll eat it now occasionally, but I don't want to put him through the self-imposed fast every time I want him to try a new food item because I'm afraid it'll stunt his growth, or cause my wife to have a breakdown.\n\nHe's shorter than kids his age and he has amblyopia. I'm uncertain as to whether those are genetic issues or if it's his unhealthy diet. The rest of my family brushes it off as if we don't know what we're doing. I hear, \"You're not trying hard enough, have you attempted _____?\" I've tried everything I can think of, every trick I can find floating around on parenting websites, but nothing seems to work. Is there anyone on this subreddit that has experienced anything like this? I'm willing to try anything new to get him to expand his diet.",

            "selftext": "This is a throwaway account.\n\nBasic set up : wife works full-time, I work part-time.  We live on my wife's family's property with her mom.  Two sons, 8 year old, A, finishing second grade, 6 year old, B, wrapping up half-day kindergarten.  A is a very bright child.  He taught himself to read at 3, and he's consistently tested years ahead of himself in all areas.  We keep him with his age group because we live in a farming area and there aren't any neighborhood kids, so I know that both of their, A's in particular, social skills are somewhat lacking.  I do extra Khan Academy work with him and engage him intellectually at home more than he gets at school.\n\nTo be fair, they are both wonderful children, especially at school.  They're the best of friends and get along extremely well together at home.  I always have teachers and staff (it's a small private school) how polite they are.\n\nHowever, over the last month, A has become rather defiant at home.  Nothing high-handed or mean like you'd expect from a rebellious teen, but just constant, daily disregard of anything that my I say to him.  I've always thought that I have a very good, mutually respectful relationship with my kids.  We talk about EVERYTHING and I've talked to him for hours about this issue.  His general attitude is thankless and remorseless.\n\nI spend way more time with the kids than my wife does and she's been upset for the past two weeks because I've gradually taken away ALL of his special privileges (Netflix, computer, Xbox, and later even educational shows like Beakman's World and even playing on the trampoline) and she thinks I'm being unnecessarily harsh.  Today my wife was at work and A proceeded to break the washing machine (long story), lie about it (which bothers me more than the act itself) and a string of minor occurrences.  My wife gets home from work and I express my frustration.  I don't think it's doing much good to have him sit in the corner half the day, which he did.  She basically takes his side and we agree to talk later.  Come in, eat dinner and afterwards she tells him to get in the shower.  He runs around the house and sneaks out of an open sliding glass door and is playing outside.  I point this out to her and reprimand him.  He showers, comes downstairs and picks up one of B's stuffed animals with a grass skirt that B had put on it.  He makes a comment about taking off the skirt.  My wife, who is on a laptop face-to-face with me, also on a laptop, tells him, no, that's B's toy, leave it alone.  A sits on the couch behind my wife out of my wife.  I wait 15 seconds, IM her and say that I bet he's taken the skirt off anyway.  He did.\n\nFinally, my wife realizes that this is what I have to deal with constantly every day.  It's not usually big stuff like breaking the dishwasher, but it's \"Don't touch that,\" and he touches it.  \"Go get this,\" and he walks off to do something else.  \"No, you may not have a (...),\" and he gets one for himself when no one is looking.\n\nI neither approve nor disapprove of spanking at this age.  I did it when the kids were like two and a pat that I know doesn't really hurt would make them cry.  I bring this up because, in the first few seconds, I have this gut reaction to bend him over my knee like I got as a kid.  I first hand how traumatizing being spanked when the parent/care-giver is angry can be.  I don't want to mess him up, but I'm really running out of ideas.  \n\nI'm normally a peaceful, patient person, but A's attitude has invoked a rage in me that I've never experienced before.  Last week, I talked about this more generally at a support group I attend (AA).  A fellow anon expressed similar feelings about his dealings with his 91 year old mother who lives with him.  We came to the conclusion that you really have to love someone an awful lot for them to enrage you so.  I really love my son and I hate seeing him in trouble all the time.  I know I would cry if I actually did wind up spanking my son.\n\nTL;DR - normally wonderfully-behaved son has suddenly expressed disregard for me as an authority figure.  Need help.",

When watching cartoons, I've noticed that she get's frustrated, or upset if they don't show a character getting 'killed' or seriously hurt (she watches a lot of Tom and Jerry, Spongebob and Looney Toons, which I don't approve of for her age). And also when she plays my video games (Okami and Epic Mickey) she'll 'attack' all the innocent characters, and laugh like crazy at their hurt reactions. I've asked her why she does this, to which she responded, \"I've never seen them get hurt before, and I want to see that it looks like.\"\nDuring one episode of Tom and Jerry, Tom get's his head chopped off, off screen, and she got really upset about not being able to see it. I tried to explain to her why it's really not something that someone would want to see, and why they can't show it on tv. She got a little more upset told me, \"I've never seen a cat get it's head cut off, and I want to see it.\"\nJust this last weekend, she came over to visit for the weekend, and went on to tell me about a dead bird she found at school, and every time she brought it to someone else, she would laugh hysterically about it, as if it were a joke.\nSo, reddit, I would like to know if this is some normal curiosity, or something I should talk to her about? Is it a good idea if I bring this up with her mother?\nAll this started maybe about two months ago.\nas a side note, her father (my older brother) commited suicide last September (thankfully his daughter was not here when it happened). Could it somehow be related to the loss of her dad?\n",

The problem I have with juice is that its SO full of sugar, my nephews drink it all the time and I water it down half and half (the parents never do). I was wondering, is tea was ok? I know there are some bad choices (e.i black tea has a decent amount of caffeine) so here would be my potential \"tea rules\" :  \n\n1.) green or white teas due to the lower caffeine (if this is still a bad idea let me know)  \n2.) Light/gentle herbal/fruit teas I know some herbal blends could be harmful so I planned to limit it to chamomile/lavender types and fruit blends that are only mixed with green/white or maybe decaf  teas?  \n3.) dilute with water if its a stronger tasting blend\n\nI am nurse/pump full time right now, I don't plan on giving him anything like this until he is ready for sippy cups and the like.",

            "selftext": "Our daughter is almost 3.  There are some things in her life that are\nnon-negotiable.  She has to brush her teeth twice a day.  She has to\nbe in her carseat when the car is moving.  She is not allowed to hit\nor kick or there is a timeout.  Other than things like that, we pretty\nmuch work around her desires.  \n\nWe use playful parenting techniques and she is pretty good about happily going along with us (i.e. getting dressed, transitions, etc.) with a bit of occasional whining.  But for example, on Saturday we had planned to run some errands.  She just didn't want to leave the house, so instead we stayed home and baked and did laundry, etc. and ran errands the next day.  We are starting to wonder if she is going to be spoiled if we continue to let her desires trump the rest of the family's.  She goes to daycare, so for a substantial portion of the day she has to compromise her desires with her classmates and teachers, but at home it mostly resolves around her.  \n\nWhen she was younger we had no problem subjugating our desires to hers, but as she gets older we feel she needs to learn to compromise more. What is an appropriate age to begin this transition and how do we do it successfully?\n\n**EDIT**:  My wife posted this same question on babycenter:\nhttp://community.babycenter.com/post/a31923837/how_much_should_a_toddlerpreschooler_get_what_ever_they_want",

            "selftext": "Hey everybody! This is my first submission to /r/raisingkids, my first self post at all really, so be gentle.\n\nWe have a 20 month old boy at home, who was an absolute dream baby. Slept through the night at 4 weeks, never a picky eater, entirely lovable, funny, and smart. &lt;/brag&gt;\n\nThat said, our second son was born the 6th, and after an extended stay at the hospital for some weight loss issues (he was still a 9 lb baby, no real worries there), we finally got to bring him home on Monday. \n\nAfter all that time between the grandparents watching him, and with the addition of a new baby, our first son is having a hard time getting back into a routine. He's great with the newborn, but with us he is petulant, cranky, and *may* have eaten one or two full meals worth of food in the last couple days. Weird side effect: also wants milk all the time now (he only gets milk right before bed now). Most likely this comes from seeing his brother get his bottle that we have to supplement with, so that's no big deal, just odd.\n\nI was just wondering, as I am sure some of you have faced this problem: do you have any suggestions as to how I can help my son get used to this new presence in the house, this new routine? I am being patient with him because I am sure it is hard, but it hurts to see him so upset, and I hope I can help resolve it soon.\n\n**TL;DR: Toddler is flustered with addition of newbaby, and I am really at a loss as to how to help him.** ",

The idea here is to generate content for our [FAQ](http://reddit.com/r/raisingkids/faq).\n\nHere are the \"rules\" for FAQ Friday:\n\n* Recommendations should be put in top level comments.\n* 1 suggestion per comment.\n* Top 10 comments in each age range with at least a score of 2 will get copied into the FAQ\n* In your comment identify which age range it is for (if appropriate)\n\nThis is one post where you can ignore reddiquette and just vote up/down based upon whether you agree with the recommendation.\n\nI will probably wait until Tuesday or so to give everyone a chance to post and vote.  I'll edit this post once the voting has 'closed'.",
